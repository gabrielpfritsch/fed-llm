  "text": "August 01, 2007 Federal Reserve Initiatives to Support Minority-Owned Institutions and Expand Consumer Protection Governor Randall S. Kroszner At the Interagency Minority Depository Institutions National Conference, Miami, Florida Share It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about issues and programs of mutual interest, with a focus on the Federal Reserve's work to strengthen our support of minority-owned depository institutions. The Federal Reserve recognizes the important role that minority-owned banks play in the financial services market through the services they provide to their communities. I have chaired the oversight committee on consumer and community affairs at the Board since March and am especially excited to be involved with a number of new and ongoing initiatives. In particular, this morning I am delighted to announce a new program that formalizes the Federal Reserve's long-standing commitment to minority-owned depository institutions. In addition, I will discuss several ongoing supervisory and regulatory initiatives that aim to improve consumer information and expand consumer protection. Federal Reserve System's Minority-Owned Institutions (MOI) Program Nationally, there about 200 minority-owned depository institutions serving a broad range of communities and populations. These banks have long played a unique and important role in our banking system by providing access to credit and financial services in markets that have historically been underserved. The Federal Reserve, which supervises just under twenty of these institutions, is committed to promoting the success of the minority-owned depository institutions we oversee. Supporting these institutions is fundamental to our overall supervisory responsibilities for ensuring a safe, sound, and competitive banking system that also protects consumers. We have consistently provided ongoing assistance, through our regulatory, supervisory, and community development functions, to address the unique challenges and needs of minority-owned banks, while at the same time holding them to the high standards of supervisory performance. The Federal Reserve has tapped the expertise at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to spearhead development of a proactive training and technical assistance program for minority-owned depository institutions. The new minority-owned institutions (MOI) program I will discuss today reflects our experience in addressing the needs of these institutions as well as the insights offered in a recent report issued by the Government Accountability Office. The innovative MOI program consists of three modules, each focusing on issues that are most relevant at a particular point in a bank's life cycle: \"Starting Up,\" \"Managing Initial Growth,\" and \"Managing a Mature Institution.\" The program thus will be valuable for potential entrants as well as those that have been in the market for many years. I think of the new MOI program as a type of course of study in a contemporary MBA curriculum, one that draws on insights and experiences from economics, accounting, finance, and compliance and focuses on the particular challenges of establishing and sustaining robust and vibrant minority-owned depository institutions. The first module, \"Starting Up,\" addresses the steps in filing an application and other issues related to a bank's chartering process, such as raising capital, assembling a successful board and management team, and conducting market analyses. The second module, \"Managing Initial Growth,\" targets institutions that are managing growth and other transitions that occur during the first five years of their existence. Training at this stage focuses on the institution's need to stabilize operations in a competitive environment and addresses issues essential to sustainability, such as maintaining capital and liquidity, managing credit and interest rate risk, ensuring compliance with banking laws and regulations, and developing new products. The third module, \"Managing a Mature Institution,\" focuses on growing the institution and shareholder value. Participants in this portion of the training will learn more about how to achieve growth targets in a safe and sound manner, measure performance of the board and management team, and expand their market. While these training modules are comprehensive in scope, the course designers recognize that there may be additional information and training needs. A great deal of flexibility is being built into the curriculum, so that an expanded version of the modules can be provided to institutions that have specific concerns or issues. In addition, each module features a section on supervisory and regulatory relations, to help build and maintain a strong dialogue between minority-owned banks and their regulators. The program also provides for quality control and continuing assessment, through such elements as instructor coaching and curriculum evaluation, to ensure that the course remains responsive to the target audiences' needs. A pilot program will be launched this fall, with a number of workshops to be held in selected Federal Reserve Districts and a roll-out of some web-based training. Throughout the pilot period and after launch of the full program in early 2008, the Federal Reserve will continue to work with the industry and interagency partners to identify ways to increase the training's responsiveness. This innovative MOI initiative underscores our commitment to providing essential information and supervisory support that helps institutions both improve their operating efficiency--thereby reducing costs and, ultimately, regulatory burden--and enhance their ability to serve their communities more effectively. Federal Reserve's Functions and Roles in Bank Oversight and Consumer Protection The Federal Reserve's MOI program demonstrates a long-standing commitment to fostering a banking system that is competitive, diverse, and fair, to the benefit of both banking organizations and consumers. Toward this end, we use all the supervisory, regulatory, and other tools available to us. One example is the recently issued proposal on interagency Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) guidelines, which seeks to affirm that banks' investments in minority-owned banks receive favorable consideration under the investment test. Now I'd like to discuss some of those tools and several recent Federal Reserve initiatives to address current issues of concern, with an emphasis on consumer protection. The Federal Reserve fulfills its consumer protection mandate through four complementary processes. The first process is examining supervised financial institutions for safety and soundness, and for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. This includes taking supervisory action as appropriate to enforce the laws and resolve any consumer complaints. The second is rulewriting--issuing regulations, either separately or jointly with other federal agencies, to implement the consumer financial services and fair lending laws. The third is promoting consumer education through publications and through partnerships with other organizations. And the fourth is promoting community development and fair and impartial access to credit by conducting outreach activities in lower-income communities and traditionally underserved markets. Supervisory Efforts on Subprime Mortgage Lending With respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve exercises its examination and enforcement authority to monitor and address issues of concern at the banks it oversees. In addition, we often issue guidance to provide the industry with supervisory \"best practices\" for addressing safety and soundness and consumer protection matters. Guidance is generally a more-responsive supervisory tool than rules, and it allows institutions more flexibility in adopting new business practices. Over the years, the Federal Reserve, in concert with other supervisory agencies, has issued a series of supervisory guidance documents to address subprime and nontraditional mortgage lending issues. The guidance has underscored the importance of a well-structured risk-management program for subprime lenders and has stressed that lending standards should include well-defined underwriting parameters, such as acceptable loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios, and minimum acceptable credit scores. Guidance has also been used to address common predatory and abusive lending practices, including making unaffordable loans, inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly to generate fee income, and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation. Reviews of Non-Depository Subprime Mortgage Lenders This supervisory guidance, together with market forces, has contributed to adjustments in subprime lending practices, particularly by federally supervised banks. However, we are all keenly aware that ongoing issues in the subprime market require additional action to address the very real and significant impact that rising delinquencies and foreclosures are having on individuals and communities. Regulatory Initiatives In addition to exercising supervisory authority, the Federal Reserve is using its regulatory power to review the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) regulations, with the intent of making the disclosures that help consumers understand their loan terms more effective. To be effective, disclosures must give consumers information about credit pricing at a time when the information is relevant, in language they can easily understand. The information must also be in a format that allows consumers to pick out and use the information that is most important to them. Better credit disclosure facilitates better-informed credit decisions, and hence more-effective competition among creditors. In a nutshell, effective disclosure empowers consumers and enhances competition. The Federal Reserve Board has recently taken a new approach to increasing the effectiveness of disclosure--namely, surveying and responding to consumers through consumer testing. Having taught at a business school for many years, I am well aware of the types of consumer testing that firms have long employed: surveys, focus groups, and so-called \"mall intercepts,\" whereby shoppers are interviewed at random. Systematically using such techniques to tailor the disclosure requirements set out in the regulations of the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators is, however, relatively novel. After extensive consumer testing, the Board issued a proposal in May that reflects consumers' thoughts on clearer and easier-to-understand credit card disclosures. In particular, the proposed disclosures would highlight applicable rates and fees, especially penalties that might be imposed. The proposed rules would also require card issuers to provide forty-five days' advance notice of a rate increase or any other change in account terms so that consumers will not be surprised by unexpected charges and will have time to explore alternatives. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve is undertaking other projects that can be implemented more quickly. For example, the Board plans to respond to concerns about misleading or incomplete marketing practices in the mortgage market. By the end of the year, we will propose changes to TILA rules concerning mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations. These proposed rules will also address issues relating to the timing of disclosures, to ensure not only that consumers get the information they need, but that they get it when it would be most useful to them. Community Affairs and Consumer Education Roles The Federal Reserve also looks beyond its supervisory and regulatory functions to address concerns of information asymmetries and access to financial services in local markets. A core principle of economics is that markets are more competitive, and therefore more efficient, when accurate information is available to both consumers and suppliers. In addition, the Federal Reserve has a robust consumer education program. Through our consumer education publications, programs, and partnerships, the Federal Reserve informs consumers about financial transactions and the regulations that govern those transactions, to help them understand consumer protections and their rights when shopping for various products. For example, the Board has published brochures to assist consumers when they are shopping for a credit card, looking for a mortgage, or leasing a vehicle. We have also published brochures to help consumers understand their checking accounts and overdraft protection programs and to educate them on the effects of having their payments processed electronically. Recently the Board has focused on helping consumers better understand nontraditional mortgage products and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and has prepared a consumer publication on these products. In June, we launched an online mortgage calculator that allows consumers to easily compare their monthly payments, and the amount of equity they will build, under several kinds of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. In my time at the Federal Reserve, I have had the opportunity to see the benefits that community development and consumer education efforts offer. As noted earlier, I am actively involved with the work of the Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs through my chairmanship of the oversight committee. In addition, I am pleased to be serving on the board of NeighborWorks America® , a national nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and preserving affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families and neighborhoods. These roles give me valuable insight into the complexity of the financial services issues in these markets as well as an appreciation of the organizations and institutions that are committed to understanding these challenges and designing creative solutions to overcome them. Conclusion In closing, I would like thank you for the opportunity to underscore the Federal Reserve's commitment to promoting the vibrant, competitive, and diverse banking markets that are so vital to our economy. We are dedicated to using our roles as supervisors, regulators, community development facilitators, and consumer educators to support the banking organizations that contribute to our robust financial services system--and the consumers who are vital to that system's success.
