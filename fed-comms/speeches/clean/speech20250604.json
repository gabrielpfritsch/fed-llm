  "text": "As an economist, I am always studying incoming data and information to make the best policy decisions. Much of that comes in the form of statistics from various agencies, universities, and businesses. But another extremely valuable input comes from people, like you, who can tell us how the economy is playing out in their daily lives as they make purchases, consider investments, and think about employment choices. That is why I especially value these opportunities. Thank you. I look forward to hearing your input. 1.
