  "text": "I recently came across a picture of myself in seventh grade at the county social science fair. It appeared in the Milledgeville, Ga., Union-Recorder newspaper, which, mercifully, does not have an online photo archive. I did not know it at the time, but that social science fair picture is a milestone in my own journey, a path that has both intersected with and run parallel to those of Delta as a whole and to one Soror in particularâour first president, Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. My mother, Mary Murray Cook, and aunts, Dr. Loretta Murray Braxton and Wivona Murray Ward, were professors and teachers in STEM (and all Deltas!). I am grateful that Aunt Vone, a math teacher in the Norfolk public school system for 35 years, is here with us today. As a sixth grader growing up on a college campus, I had always understood academics as essentially split between the hard sciences the women in my family taught and the humanities. Sadie T.M. Alexander's work imparted three important lessons that would act as a compass. Second, she showed me not just what could be studied, but what kind of questions should be asked. Each of these settled on, and stayed with, me in different and illuminating ways. The first lesson was like a lightbulbâimmediate, clear, bright. There was so much to be studied, the only limitation seemed to be the hours in a day. The second lesson was like a sunriseâdawning with beauty and growing steadily stronger. There were so many questions I needed to ask, and each one led to another, while every answer opened a new line of inquiry. And the more I asked, the better the questions became. The third lesson was like a supermoonâtowering, imposing, but looming so closely, it seems like you could reach out and touch it with your hand. I knew that the way I sought answers would matter to my work, but it would take time to fully understand why and how. I can see each of those lessons in that photo. I believe these seeds planted by Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander introduced me to my calling. Economics was not necessarily a done dealâI thought I might do a Ph.D. in philosophy at one point, when I was studying philosophy at Oxford University and at the Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar in Senegal. But economics turned out to be my purpose and my passion. Economics is the fundamental toolkit I use to find answers to the multitude of questions swirling around my head at any given moment. I see economics at work in everyday life and know how foundational it is to every society and community's success. There is a passage from an Alice Dunbar-Nelson poemâbecause why quote the rest when Deltas are the bestâthat goes: In all the world's great, ceaseless struggling strife, Go to our work with gladsome, buoyant step, And love it for its sake, whate'er it be. Delta's dedication to learning and public service gave us an advantage in considering the mission that would occupy our lives. We thought about the change we could make and the influence we could have. We did the advanced calculus that measured the goodness of trouble against the enormity of student debt payments. We knew we wanted workâwhether a professional calling or life's workâthat, as Soror Alice said, we loved \"for its sake.\" While I do not always have a buoyant step, and \"gladsome\" is probably not the first word I would use to describe myself, I do love my work for its sake, which is a tremendous gift. And I was drawn to Delta, because I wanted to be surrounded by people who would use their talents and passions to improve the lives and well-being of all people in the world. Why am I bringing this up today? I am sticking to the assignment: Deltas embracing the past and shaping the future. We are here to commemorate our founders, our forebears, and the ties that bind us. To celebrate the ways that Delta's esteemed history brought each of us through its doors, and how membership helped to shape who we are and who we are yet to become. And Delta, along with other Divine Nine organizations, can be key to shaping the future of economics. Diversity is critical to any profession, but particularly to thoseâlike economicsâthat tend toward the homogenous. Or thoseâlike economicsâthat affect people's daily lives. As policymakers, my colleagues and I make decisions that impact the entire country. We are driven by data, which we collect in abundance. But our own experiences, including our education, professional experience, and personal understanding, inform how we seek out that data and discern what it means for the future. As with any discipline, different perspectives formulate different questions whose answers reveal new truths. Economic conundrums persist, including disparities in pay, economic mobility, and generational wealth. Solutions are more likely to come if each wave of newly minted economists reflects the makeup of the country. And both the country and the profession need the deepest, broadest talent pool possible to keep up with a constantly evolving economy. I believe Delta can be a source of momentum by harnessing its core virtues of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and social action. I had many mentors throughout my career, from a variety of backgrounds. I would not be where I am todayâhere, standing in a position of honor in front of 1,100 Deltasâwithout them. But if I had not heard of Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, I might not have felt such a strong connection to social science and economics quite as early as the sixth grade. Through scholarship. Sadie T.M. Alexander was a model of intellectual curiosity and rigor. She was determined and she was disciplined. To remind you of the history we learned through Delta, she scaled a mountain when she became the first African American, of any gender, to receive an economics Ph.D. When that scholarship and natural talent was ignored, and prejudice denied her the place she had earned in the profession, she showed resolve and grace by turning around and getting a J.D., also at the University of Pennsylvaniaâand securing another \"first.\" She still used her economic knowledge, as you know, in her legal work and lifelong campaign for civil rights. Both of us viewed our fields with unique perspectives, informed by our daily experiences and by occasions of history we saw firsthand. Sadie Alexander saw the Great Depression up close, and the real-life impact of disparities in labor market opportunities. I was fascinated by the same questions decades later and felt a renewed urgency as I watched the fallout of the Global Financial Crisis from the heart of industrial Michigan. I first noticed the once-unimposing campus food bank when lines of students began to form at its doors. Indeed, I feel a great sense of honor in being allowed to serve the public in this capacity. And a great sense of purpose comes with knowing that I am able to use the best of my talents and the breadth of my professional passion to help protect the public from experiencing such a fallout again. And through social action. I may feel that honor more acutely, because I know it was not one available to my spiritual mentor. Despite her talent, work, and potential to transform the fieldâor perhaps because of itâDr. Alexander was not able to practice her chosen profession. She went on to be a rock star in another competitive arena, which is a tidy and valiant coda. But it will always stick with me that despite the success of her plan B, she was not allowed to do the thing she loved, the thing she naturally connected with, the way I was. To me, \"social action\" is telling all the Deltasâin this room and in every chapter around the globeâwho are still contemplating their educational and career paths to consider economics. I am specifically speaking to the students, but if you are thinking of a career change, this includes you, too. It is an important field that touches virtually every aspect of daily life. It is a challenging fieldâwhich Deltas are made forâthat has so much left to explore. In short, it is a field that embodies Delta's roots in sisterhood, scholarship, service, and social change. And even if you do not embark on a career in economics, think about taking a few classes. I promise that the skills you learn will be useful in the future. When Soror Aunt Loretta retired from being chair of the math department at Virginia State University in the mid-1990s, she founded and led an investment club with retired friends, colleagues, and neighbors in the Petersburg area. And their portfolios typically outperformed the market because of their new interest in economics and finance. While the economics profession was open to me in a way that it was not for Sadie Alexander, it still has had its hurdles. I learned early on that one of the parallels between our livesâthe importance our families placed on educationâwas an advantage so big it was almost a superpower. It never occurred to me that someone might assume I was bad at math. Between my mother, my aunts, my extended family, and my parents' friends, I had essentially understood STEM to be women's work. When I encountered people who thought I should not be thereâlike the other graduate students who introduced themselves by quizzing me on mathematical principlesâI was honestly more baffled than incredulous. I had mentors who encouraged my work, and they were essential to blocking out the voices saying I did not belong. I needed those champions and resolved to be one myself. I told and continue to tell my former students in the American Economic Association's Summer Program all the time, and I will say it to all of you: You belong here. Your insights are unique, and the profession would benefit from them. It is not too late, you are not too far behind, and you can even come late to the decision to study economics and still thrive. The other thing that helped to drown out the negative voices was understanding historyâour own and my own, Sadie T.M. Alexander's and Delta's. All of those individual paths and all the places that they intersect. Knowing our history is powerful. Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the pioneering journalistâand, obviously, Deltaâcalls that history \"our armor.\" She also says it is the wind at our backs. We have to claim that history; let it infuse us, guide us, and be our center. I tell my sisters at Spelman, my sisters in Delta, all young Black women, and all women, whether young or older: You have to block out the noise. I learned that desegregating schools in Georgia, and I carried it with me throughout my career. Block out the noise of low expectations for your own sake. And use that history to your advantage. To quote another Deltaâbecause I can do this all dayâ\"challenges make you discover things about yourself that you never really knew. They're what make the instrument stretch; what make you go beyond the norm.\" Thank you, Cicely Tyson! I told the story of my seventh grade social science projectâand that photoâat the ceremonial swearing-in for new Fed governors. I did not tell the follow-up story, which happened on my first day. I was still absorbing the magnitude of this job, walking the hallways of one of the most revered institutions in my profession, when I came face-to-face with a portrait of Dr. Alexander. It was a joy to see her recognized, and it felt like a preordained meetingâanother milestone on my journey marked by the spirit of Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander and Delta Sigma Theta. 1.
