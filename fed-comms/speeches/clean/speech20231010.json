  "text": "At \"The Legacy of Bennett McCallum and Lessons for Monetary Policy Today,\" a conference sponsored by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Washington, D.C. I will cover these issues in the context of discussing broad developments in U.S. monetary policy over the past quarter-century.1 In doing so, I'm motivated by McCallum's 1999 paper \"Recent Developments in Monetary Policy Analysis: The Roles of Theory and Evidence,\" which was a review of the previous 25 years.2 In my remarks, I'll first talk about changes that have taken place since the 1990s in the way in which the FOMC has conducted policy. Then I'll turn to a discussion of monetary policy rules, how Ben thought about them, their use as an input into policymakers' decisions, and the choice of instruments and targets in policy rules. Developments in Monetary Policy from 1998 to 2023 McCallum's review, which was largely written in 1998, contrasted monetary policy analysis in 1973 and 1998. In 1973, many economies were adjusting to the demise of the Bretton Woods international monetary system, and their domestic monetary policy regimes were starting to develop alongside floating exchange rates as well as the first oil shock that materialized during that year. In the U.S., continued dissatisfaction with economic performanceâparticularly high inflationâled to the restrictive monetary policy implemented by Paul Volcker from 1979 to 1982. The disinflation delivered by this policy was followed by greatly improved overall economic performance in the period that came to be known as the Great Moderation. The Great Moderation was also associated, in the era of Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Federal Reserve, with inflation moving down further, to rates consistent with price stability. In the 25 years since 1998, there have been numerous changes in U.S. monetary policy arrangements. These have included several important reforms that were substantially along the lines advocated by Ben and others. In multiple ways, the FOMC's policy framework has become much more explicit. At the end of 2007, the FOMC began publishing a quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, collecting information on individual meeting participants' forecasts. Then, in January 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategyâalso known as our consensus statement. The consensus statement has been reaffirmed every year and revised several times. From its inception, it made the price-stability goal that is part of our congressional mandate more concrete by indicating that Federal Reserve policymakers interpret it as a 2 percent longer-run inflation rate (in the personal consumption expenditures price index). In 2011, Ben Bernanke initiated the practice of postmeeting press conferences, which under Chair Powell's leadership now follow every FOMC meeting. In the summer of 2020, FOMC participants released a revised consensus statement that further elaborated their interpretation of the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability and how the Committee would pursue those objectives. The new statement explicitly recognized the policy tools of asset purchases and forward guidance on the federal funds rate. These tools were developed during the period, which started in late 2008, in which the federal funds rate was at the effective lower bound (ELB), and they were used again during the new ELB episode that began in March 2020. As many observers have noted over the years, the introduction of the 2 percent inflation objective and other formalizations of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework actually took place well after disinflation had been achieved under Volcker and consolidated under Greenspan. It might be asked whyâwith price stability secured by around the mid-1990sâthese formalizations were thought necessary. The answer lies in the fact that a well-understood monetary policy regime is needed to make price stability and anchored inflation expectations durable features of the economic environment.3 Communicating key characteristics of the regimeâincluding the numerical inflation target and policymakers' reaction functionâmakes it concrete and transparent in the eyes of the general public while also enhancing the central bank's credibility and the effectiveness of monetary policy. The benefits of an explicit, transparent policy regime are brought out clearly by our recent experience. When the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to tame inflation, it used forward guidance to make clear our intention to reach a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent. I believe that this guidance has made our policy actions more effective. The FOMC's Reaction Function and the Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules Forward guidance and the postmeeting statement are major means by which the FOMC is able to communicate to households, businesses, and financial markets key aspects of our reaction function. The reaction function connects decisions on our main policy instrumentâthe federal funds rateâto inflation and other key variables, such as data on labor market conditions. A second, related message of McCallum's work was that different rule specifications can concretely characterize differences among economists on appropriate monetary policy. In the 1970s, the whole notion of policy rules was closely associated with advocates of monetarism and rational expectations, with Keynesian economics being seen as entailing opposition to policy rules. McCallum opposed this dichotomy and observed, \"To me it seems quite clear that debates between economistsâfor example, Milton Friedman and James Tobinâare about the desirability of different policy rules.\"8 That is, McCallum wanted to represent alternative perspectives on monetary policy as different rule specifications, and he urged the study of rules as a means of understanding various policy prescriptions and their consequences for the economy. This perspective on rules has also become standard. Indeed, the box on monetary policy rules that regularly appears in the Federal Reserve Board's Monetary Policy Report provides a menu of policy rules designed to reflect a variety of views about the appropriate formulation of monetary policy.9 Similarly, multiple rule prescriptions and the possible implications of alternative rules for economic outcomes have, for many years, been a regular part of the briefing materials that go to policymakers before each FOMC meeting, allowing policymakers to incorporate these prescriptions into their thinking and discussions.10 A third message of McCallum's work on rules was that there were merits in actual policy following \"rule-like\" behavior.11 He recognized that policy rules were not likely to be used literally or mechanically as a means of deciding on monetary policy actions. Even so, McCallum believed that rules provided information about the responses to the state of the economy that were likely to be associated with more successful policymaking. According to this reasoning, the prescriptions coming from policy rules provide valuable benchmarks. As McCallum put it, \"Actual central banks are unlikely to officially adopt such rules, of course, but consideration of their implications could nevertheless prove helpful in practice.\"12 McCallum also noted that this idea was strongly advanced by John Taylor in his 1993 paper introducing the Taylor rule.13 It's worth looking at some features of the Taylor rule, as this will help bring out the connections between the policy rules literature and Federal Reserve practice. My discussion of these features will underline the fact that it is today widely accepted that the predictability of policymakers' reaction function strengthens the stabilizing properties of monetary policy. In that sense, policymakers understand the value of making decisions in \"rule-like\" ways. First, I will discuss the Taylor rule formula's left-hand sideâits specification of the instrument. I will then turn to its right-hand sideâthe target variables to which the instrument responds. Central banks were likewise receptive to the analysis of interest rate rulesâand the Taylor rule in particular. Their favorable reaction was driven by two factors. First, after the experience of monetary targeting, central banks were disillusioned with policy analysis that was focused on monetary aggregates. Second, interest rate rules were policy relevant because these rules were expressed in terms of the short-term interest rate on which central banks actually made decisions. As McCallum put it, \"The fact is that actual central banks in industrial countries conduct monetary policy in a manner that is much more accurately depicted by writing [the interest rate] as the instrument.\"17 Reflecting this reality, all the rules considered in our Monetary Policy Report are interest rate rules.18 Monetary Policy Targets An additional attraction of the Taylor rule is that the right-hand-side variables correspond closely to economic variables for which central banks have targets: inflation and an estimate of the state of real aggregate demand or labor market conditions. I'll make a few remarks about considerations related to these targets. When it comes to the specification of the inflation term in a policy rule, in the U.S. case, it's important that the inflation target is consistent with our dual mandate, which includes a price-stability goal. In 1993, John Taylor suggested that a 2 percent inflation objective characterized the Federal Reserve's behavior in the early Greenspan years pretty well. This goal subsequently became official. In 2012, as I noted earlier, the Committee made a goal of 2 percent inflation its formal interpretation of the price-stability objective. The choice of a 2 percent longer-run goal reflected a broad consensus that this rate corresponded to effective price stability in the United States. Around the world, too, inflation-targeting central banks view 2 percent as the rate corresponding to price stability. The FOMC has further judged that 2 percent is the inflation goal most consistent with achievement of our dual mandate. We have reaffirmed this numerical goal repeatedly since 2012, and, in tightening monetary policy since early last year, we've made clear that we're determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent. In considering the appropriate monetary policy response needed to return inflation to 2 percent, I find it useful to draw on the findings of the policy rules literature. These findings include the \"Taylor principle\" notion that deviations of inflation from target should likely be met by a more than one-for-one response of the federal funds rateâa response that helps ensure that the real interest rate is increased in policy tightenings.19 Conclusion Staying on the topic of policy targets, I think it is worth concluding by emphasizing an important respect in which things have not changed since 1998 when Ben McCallum reviewed monetary policy developments. He noted, \"Overall, the most fundamental change since the 1970s has been the assumption of responsibility by central banks for performance in terms of inflation rates. In 1998, it would be extremely surprising to run across a central bank statement that discussed medium-term inflation prospects in a manner suggesting that these are unaffected by monetary policy behavior.\"22 That difference between 1973 and 1998 is also an important contrast between 1973, when U.S. monetary policy failed to play the part that it needed to play in restoring price stability, and the FOMC's behavior over the past two years. Price stability is a primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve. This is why we have taken forceful steps aimed at reducing inflationâand why we will stay on the job to achieve our objective.

Paul Volcker essentially recognized this point in congressional testimony of July 22, 1980, when he observed that \"we want to have a firm monetary standard. . .

As already indicated, the advent of explicit inflation targeting in several countries helped motivate the changes made to the Federal Reserve's policy arrangements. But the adoption of inflation targeting abroad was itself partly driven by the analytical considerations that I am highlighting.
