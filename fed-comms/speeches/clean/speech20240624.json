  "text": "Thank you, Stefano, and thank you to the Central Bank of Italy (CBI) for hosting this year's conference. The papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of work that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate the sharing of knowledge around the world. We have sessions on how firms' balance sheets, households' savings and borrowing decisions, as well as supply chains, influence monetary policy transmission. We also will look into financial market impacts and labor market considerations of the current policy environment. And with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you."
