  "text": "The HMDA data for 2006 show that more than 45 percent of high-cost first mortgages were originated by independent mortgage companies, which are institutions that are not regulated by the federal banking agencies and that sell almost all of the mortgages they originate. In this instance, this originate-to-distribute model appears to have contributed to the breakdown in underwriting standards, as lenders often found themselves able to pass on the credit risk without much resistance from the ultimate investors. For a number of years, rapid increases in house prices effectively insulated lenders and investors from the effects of weaker underwriting, providing false comfort. The current high rate of delinquencies and foreclosures is not confined to the subprime market. In 2007, about 45 percent of foreclosures were on prime, near-prime, or government-backed mortgages. Across market segments, delinquencies are rising fastest on the more-complex loans originated over the past few years. In part, that trend seems to be due to the fact that such loans were made to borrowers in weaker financial condition. In some cases, borrowers may not have fully understood the details of their loans, including the potential for large payment increases. Regulation and SupervisionAs part of a periodic review of our regulations under HOEPA, the Federal Reserve Board in 2006 began a systematic look at changes in the mortgage industry. Four public hearings held around the country confirmed evidence that we were gathering from other sources that the mortgage market was undergoing the significant changes with which we are all now familiar. Our concerns led us in 2006 and 2007 to issue, along with other federal and state regulators, a series of guidances to the institutions we supervise that covered nontraditional mortgage loans, subprime lending, and servicing practices. Those were good steps, but we also recognized that many of the problems we were beginning to see were a result of actions by companies and individuals not subject to our supervisory oversight. Thus, we conducted an additional HOEPA hearing, focusing on four specific areas: assessment of repayment ability; low- and no-documentation lending; escrowing for taxes and insurance; and prepayment penalties. As a result of a careful review of available data and information, we proposed new rules under our HOEPA authority in December, banning practices that we found to be unfair or deceptive. Significantly, bans on such unfair or deceptive acts and practices would apply to the entire mortgage industry, not just to institutions directly regulated by the Board. Our goal was to produce clear and comprehensive rules to protect consumers from unfair practices while maintaining the viability of a market for responsible mortgage lending. The rules would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly so as to cover substantially all of the subprime market.5 The regulations would be enforceable by state and federal supervisory and enforcement agencies as well as by consumers themselves, who could recover statutory damages for violations above and beyond actual damages. The proposed rules cover a range of practices. First, the rules would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced loans that the borrower cannot reasonably be expected to repay from income or from assets other than the house. Of course, appropriate attention to the borrower's ability to repay is a fundamental feature of good underwriting. Second, we found that the prevalence of \"stated-income\" lending led to many borrowers receiving mortgages that they could not afford. Consequently, we would require lenders to verify the income or assets they rely on to make credit decisions for higher-priced loans--standard industry practice, in fact, for most lending until quite recently. Fourth, the proposed rules would ban prepayment penalties in situations in which the borrower may be especially vulnerable. For example, prepayment penalties would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50 percent and, when permitted, would be required to expire at least sixty days before a scheduled increase in the loan payment. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties that could enable a \"loan flipping\" scheme, in which a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan at adverse terms for the borrower. In seeking information and opinion about these four issues, the Board determined that additional problems needed to be addressed as well, and for all loans, not just higher-priced loans. Among the practices addressed by our proposal is the use of yield spread premiums (YSPs).6 Many consumers use mortgage brokers to guide them through a complex process and shop for the best deal. Unfortunately, consumers may believe that the broker has a responsibility to get them that best deal, which is not necessarily the case. In fact, the design of YSPs may provide the broker a financial incentive to offer a loan with a higher rate. Consumers who do not understand this point may not shop to their best advantage. Therefore, we would prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker an amount greater than the consumer agrees to in advance. Brokers would also have to disclose their potential conflict of interest. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure will not solve all the problems. We do believe, however, that this proposal will give consumers much better information and raise their awareness of brokers' potential conflict of interest while reducing a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate. To protect consumers and promote competition, our proposal would also ban seven specific advertising practices deemed unfair or deceptive. Under our rules, for example, mortgage originators would not be allowed to advertise a mortgage as having a \"fixed\" rate unless the advertisement also states clearly how long the rate or payment is fixed, and they could not advertise loans in one language but have important consumer disclosures in another. The proposal would also require that consumers receive loan-specific Truth in Lending Act disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. The proposal also addresses certain practices in loan servicing that can cause problems for consumers, such as delays in posting payments to a consumer's account, and it acts to prohibit coercion of appraisers by lenders or brokers. We believe these proposed rules will help protect mortgage borrowers from unfair and deceptive practices. At the same time, we did not want to create rules that were so open-ended or costly to administer that responsible lenders would pull out of the subprime market. So, our proposal is designed to protect consumers without shutting off access to responsible credit. We anticipate vigorous discussion through the public comment process that ends on April 8, and we will, as always, carefully consider this input before issuing final rules. In addition to regulations, strong uniform oversight of different types of mortgage lenders is critical to avoiding future problems. Regulatory oversight of mortgage lending has become more challenging as the breadth and depth of this market has grown over the past decade. Other changes, such as the increased role of nonbank mortgage lenders, have added complexity. To achieve more uniformly effective supervision, the Federal Reserve, together with other federal and state agencies, launched a pilot program last summer to conduct reviews of selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations. These reviews will evaluate the companies' underwriting standards as well as senior management oversight of compliance with state and federal consumer protection regulations and laws. We will take corrective or enforcement action as warranted. We plan to use this joint project as a vehicle for strengthening cooperation and coordination among federal and state agencies.

Under the proposal, a \"higher-priced mortgage loan\" would have an annual percentage rate that exceeds the yield on comparable Treasury securities by 3 percentage points or more for first-lien loans or 5 percentage points or more for subordinate-lien loans. Return to text 6. A YSP is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate the wholesale lenders would have accepted on a particular transaction and the interest rate the broker actually obtained for the lender. This dollar amount is usually paid to the mortgage broker. It may also be applied to other loan-related costs, but the Board's proposal concerns only the amount paid to the broker. Return to text 7. Some promising examples of programs to address vacancies already exist. For example, the Neighborhood Housing Services Redevelopment Corporation in Chicago has acquired hundreds of abandoned properties from such sources as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City of Chicago, bank foreclosures (that is, real estate owned), and private owners. The properties are then rehabilitated and sold to owner-occupants. In highly depressed housing markets, the worst-quality units are often demolished to mitigate safety hazards and reduce supply. For example, in Flint, Michigan, the Genesee County Land Bank acquires vacant properties through tax liens (see www.thelandbank.org). Return to text March 14, 2008 Back to Top"
