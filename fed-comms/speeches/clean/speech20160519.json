  "text": "It is an honor for me to speak at the opening of this conference in honor of Michael Woodford, whose contributions to the theory of economic policy are frequently a central part of the economic analysis that takes place in the policy discussions at the Federal Reserve.1 The main story I want to tell today is about the quality of Michael's major book, Interest and Prices (henceforth MWIP). I will start with his predecessors, beginning as Michael does in his Interest and Prices with Wicksell.2 3 I shall quote key points from and about Wicksell's Interest and Prices (henceforth KWIP), and following that, from Patinkin's Money, Interest, and Prices (second edition, 1965) (henceforth MIP), which are relevant to MWIP, Michael Woodford's Interest and Prices (2003). Wicksell follows this opening by discussing the difference between the ability of the economic system to adjust to changes in relative prices and to changes in the general level of prices. In the latter case, Wicksell states that both inflation and deflation are evils, but that it is generally believed that what is most desirable is a situation \"in which prices are rising [italics in original] slowly but steadily\" (p.3). He likens the arguments for this viewpoint as reminding one \"of those who purposely keep their watches a little fast so as to be more certain of catching their trains\" (p.3). Rational man that he was, he dismisses such behavior--of which I am guilty--as not being able to survive in the long run. And optimist as he must have been, he concludes the opening chapter of his Interest and Prices by saying that \"the prevention of these troubles by the provision of a constant measure of value cannot, in the present state of economic development, be regarded a priori as unthinkable\" (p.7) He concludes the chapter (p.50) by saying that He then sets out the specie-flow mechanism, and concludes on that subject by saying that while this explanation (the specie-flow mechanism) must be correct, the He then goes on to discuss potential reasons for the more rapid adjustment, the most important of which is that the price pressures on individual commodities that are imported or exported as a result of changes in prices in the two countries exert a direct influence--in the direction of equilibrium--in the prices of individual goods. To make this possible, Wicksell suggests the suspension of the free coinage of gold, as a \"first step towards the introduction of an ideal standard of value\"--\"an international paper standard\" (p.193). And, on a soaring personal note at the end of the formal text of the book (p.196), he writes If this were a paper about Wicksell, there would be no choice but to stop after this inspiring crescendo. But although Wicksell plays a key role in this paper, the paper is not primarily about him. Let me nonetheless conclude this section of the paper with a few additional comments. And here comes the essence of Samuelson's evaluation of his great predecessor: What Samuelson saw in 1962 had gradually become the accepted view of Wicksell in the English-speaking world after the translation of both Interest and Prices and the two volumes of his Lectures on Political Economy6 in the 1930s. And the references by Samuelson to the many topics on which Wicksell made important contributions should remind us that Wicksell's Interest and Prices was but one of his major contributions, and that Volume II of his Lectures on Political Economy is about money, banking and credit. The first paragraph of the introduction to both editions of MIP is In Note M of MIP (pp. 651-664) Patinkin reviews empirical investigations of the real-balance effect, noting that most of the studies are in effect estimates of the impact of liquid wealth holdings, rather than just real balances, on consumption. Reviews of the book. In an article published in 1993 in a festschrift for Patinkin8, I reviewed both editions of MIP.The book had been reviewed by at least twelve reviewers, whose verdicts were largely favorable, with almost all recognizing that they were dealing with a major work. Supplementary Notes. MIP includes excellent \"Supplementary Notes and Studies in the Literature\" including on the work of Walras (Notes B and C), Wicksell (Note E), of whom like almost all who studied him became admirers, on Newcomb, Fisher and the Transactions Approach to the Quantity Theory (Note F), Marshall, Pigou and the Cambridge Cash-Balance Approach (Note G), Monetary Aspects of the Casselian System (Note H), The Classical and Neoclassical Theory of Money and Interest (Note J), and Keynes' General Theory (Note K). In his review of MIP, Kenneth Arrow9 described the literature notes as \"sparkling\"--not a word frequently used in such a context. Harry Johnson's comments. In his 1962 review article on recent work on monetary theory and policy,10 Harry Johnson devoted almost a quarter of the review to MIP, which he described as \"monumentally scholarly\", but argued that its analysis of the real balance effect was \"conceptually inadequate and crucially incomplete\".11 Johnson (1962) argued further that Surprising omissions. MIP definitely achieves its goal of integrating monetary and value theory, but shows signs of its age in two omissions: first, that expectations are not emphasized and indeed barely discussed; and second, there is no analysis in MIP of ongoing inflation--the latter omission being particularly striking given Israel's inflationary history. The Structure of MWIP. Interest and Prices (MWIP) is divided into two parts. Part I, Analytic Framework, is essentially an advanced textbook on modern macro models and some of their monetary policy implications, which introduces the reader to both useful techniques of analysis and recurrent and important issues in the field. Its chapter headings are: Price-Level Determination under Interest Rate Rules; Optimizing Models with Nominal Rigidities; A Neo-Wicksellian Framework for the Analysis of Monetary Policy; and Dynamics of the Response to Monetary Policy. Part II, Optimal Policy, is more directly policy-focused, with chapter headings: Inflation Stabilization and Welfare; Gains from Commitment to a Policy Rule; and finally, Optimal Monetary Policy Rules. Analyzing Monetary Policy without Money. One of Woodford's most interesting results is that it is often possible to study monetary policy without having money in the model. In these cases, monetary policy is conducted using the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument. As Woodford notes in Chapter 4, \"A Neo-Wicksellian Framework\", a money demand equation can under some circumstances be added to the model, with the amount of money supplied by the central bank having to be consistent with the money demand equation. But inflation in such a situation is not necessarily caused by the quantity of money; rather the quantity of money may be caused by and consistent with the inflation rate resulting from the three basic equations in which the money stock does not appear--in particular from the gap between the natural and actual rates of interest. For this result to go through, the money stock cannot per se be among the variables that determine the equilibrium of the remaining--the non-monetary--part of the model. This means that the separation result is not possible if there is a real balance effect operating in the goods markets. Or to put the result differently, the separation feature is consistent with an inside money monetary system, while it may well not be consistent with an outside money structure. It is thus consistent with the suggestion by Harry Johnson mentioned above, that monetary analysis might better be carried out primarily in an inside-money than an outside-money model. This neo-Wicksellian result is somewhat surprising. It provides justification for the behavior of those central banks that think and talk of monetary policy purely in terms of the policy interest rate and other financial return variables, but not of the money stock. However, we need to remind ourselves that it is built on an assumption that the money stock per se does not appear in the basic three-equation model--and that is an assumption, not a theorem.14 The Goals of Policy. When he turns to optimal policy, Woodford starts Chapter 6 by asking what the goals of monetary policy should be. He states that there is a fair amount of consensus in the literature that a desirable monetary policy is one that achieves a low expected value of an objective function that includes inflation and \"some measure of output relative to potential.\" He then goes on to point out the many questions such a formulation leaves unanswered, including whether to target the price level or the inflation rate, should greater priority be given to reducing the variability of unforecastable inflation, should one seek to stabilize output deviations from a smooth trend or from the short-run aggregate supply curve, and so forth? And then the surprising comment (p.382) This sounds simple but it is not, for the explanation that Woodford provides is that That is not a simple thought, but it is logical--and that insight enables Michael to derive a utility or loss function with inflation in it. Interestingly, Woodford recognizes that his result is based on several approximations (pp. 383-392), but is nonetheless prepared to go ahead. While that choice is to some extent a matter of taste, it is also highly pragmatic--and some might say, a reflection of his MIT training, a comment that I would take as a compliment. The importance of the long-term interest rate. Another key result is that when you solve forward the system above, you find, as Woodford notes (p.244), that --and in a footnote he notes that this can also be explained by saying that it is the long rate of interest and not the short rate that determines aggregate demand in this model. What to do at the ZLB, Forward Guidance, The Role of Expectations. MWIP was completed well before the Fed had to contend with the ZLB--zero lower bound--which later became the ELB--effective lower bound--even though there were discussions in the U.S. economy in 2003 and earlier about what to do if the economy were ever to be at the ZLB.15 Woodford's views on forward guidance can be understood from the discussion above of the forward solution of the basic model. Woodford has long emphasized the importance of policy commitment, even in the absence of a binding ZLB constraint. At the ZLB, explicit forward guidance can potentially offset a lot of the distortion, by, in effect, reducing all interest rates across the maturity spectrum at least up to the time that policy changes. Indeed, as shown by Eggertson and Woodford (2003), optimal forward guidance should commit to maintain lower interest rates during the recovery than would otherwise have been warranted by economic conditions.16 Importantly, the appropriate commitment can be framed as a history-dependent policy function responding only to the history of the price level and the output gap, in such a way that the impact on policy decisions of economic conditions at the lower bound continue, even as the economy recovers. A history-dependent policy rule introduces a wedge between what the central bank has promised and what contemporary circumstances, taken by themselves, would call for. This wedge may raise difficult questions regarding the credibility of the policy. Woodford believes that credibility can be enhanced by spelling out an explicit framework describing the nature of any history-dependence. For example, as Woodford suggests in his 2012 Kansas City Fed paper, The very powerful effects of forward guidance have been called \"the forward guidance puzzle\". But the puzzle is not a deep one, for the ability of any central bank to commit to follow a particular monetary policy rule must be a diminishing function of the length of the horizon that is being considered. This fact serves to limit the extent to which policy can deliberately shape private expectations. However, the strength of forward guidance is just one manifestation of a very high interest elasticity in the DSGE models typically used by Woodford that shows up pervasively. For example, any combination of shocks that brings the economy to the ZLB for an appreciable length of time will display the effects of the elevated interest elasticity in such models, whether or not the central bank is assumed to issue explicit forward guidance. This high elasticity is also in evidence in attempts to evaluate alternative monetary policy regimes.17 What to do at the Lower Bound, Quantitative Easing. Woodford is much less impressed by the potential power of quantitative easing (or \"targeted asset purchases\" as he describes them in his Jackson Hole paper). He argues that portfolio balance effects do not exist in a modern, general-equilibrium theory of asset prices, and that it does not matter whether a particular risk is held in the portfolio of private investors or the central bank, for in the end the gains or losses of the central bank are transferred to the government, and via the government budget constraint, are returned to private individuals. This is Ricardian equivalence in a slightly different context than examined by Robert Barro.18 Whether it applies in practice is an empirical issue, with empirical evidence from many papers written in the Fed and elsewhere suggesting a significant impact in the expected direction from quantitative easing actions undertaken by the Fed and other central banks.19 Money Supply versus Interest Rate. At present, the Neo-Wicksellian approach developed by Woodford and others is dominant, relative to the explicitly monetary approach to monetary policy used by Patinkin and others. I suspect this situation will continue. But I believe that we need to consider both approaches to monetary policy, for monetary policy affects the economy not only through the Euler equation as in Woodford, but also through direct effects on current demands for goods described by Patinkin's use of the real-balance effect and by Wicksell's explanation of price dynamics described earlier. The fundamental impact of Michael Woodford on Fed thinking:20 The most direct impact of Woodford on Fed thinking and analysis comes from his neo-Wicksellian analysis of monetary policy. Essentially, Woodford has developed the links between fluctuations of output and inflation around their natural21 or long-run equilibrium values and economic welfare--a point22 made clear by the discussion above of his analysis of the optimal goals of monetary policy. While estimates of the natural rate from DSGE models provide some information needed for the proper conduct of monetary policy, these estimates are closely tied to the structure of the DSGE models, and essentially ignore the possibility of long-term structural changes in the balance between saving and investment. As a result, an alternative longer-run concept, the equilibrium rate of interest, has also played an important role in recent policy discussions. Estimates of this concept, which follow a statistical approach introduced by Thomas Laubach and John Williams24, have also fallen to quite low levels. 1.

Wicksell was not only a superb economist but also a remarkably interesting man, whose major works in economics were published starting in the late 1890s, when he was nearing the age of 50 (he was born in 1851 and died in 1926). Much of his earlier work was on Malthus and Malthusianism. The last paragraph of the text of Gardlund's book (p. 330) is about Wicksell's funeral and reads \"Various associations and academic institutions sent the customary wreaths, but many of Wicksell's friends and disciples, honoring a request, instead sent their contributions to the Malthusian Advice Bureau.\" Return to text 4. He gives several reasons that the assumptions have little relation to practice, including that there is \"a kind of collective holding of balances, arising out of the acceptance by banks of deposits.\" Return to text 5.

It is worth noting that the money stock dropped out of many models in the 1980s because standard relationships between money and real variables became unstable and because money aggregates became difficult to control.
