  "text": "The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in the national economy and monetary policy. But through the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country, it also gets involved in efforts to support local communities and their economies. This work helps to enhance our understanding of the pace of economic recovery and further creates a backdrop for a national dialogue about common problems and their potential solutions. Over the last several years, every community across the country has felt the effects of the financial crisis. Foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties threaten neighborhoods nationwide, and community leaders are working to stabilize those neighborhoods. While the problem touches every community, it doesn't look the same in each because it's shaped by the circumstances that prevailed in those neighborhoods before the crisis hit. Cleveland Cleveland neighborhoods face five decades of population loss, outmigration of jobs, and urban sprawl, in addition to the more recent wave of foreclosures. Despite these persistent challenges, city leaders have responded with dynamic leadership. In Cleveland, public and private partners have created an innovative stabilization strategy that uses targeted data to help community leaders focus scarce resources on the neighborhoods that have the best chance for success. This is a model that has great potential to be replicated in other cities. Let's watch Cleveland's story. As the video highlights, Cleveland's success is built around both on-the-ground community outreach and intensive data collection that helps to identify block-level and community-level trends. It showcases strong collaboration among city and county officials; nonprofits like Neighborhood Progress, Inc.; local foundations; and universities. The Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing (NEO CANDO) provides cutting-edge analytical mapping tools, and these data help steer resources into neighborhoods where the money will have the greatest impact. This \"tipping point\" strategy relies on the comprehensive investment of public and private resources for sustained stabilization. Detroit While population growth may eventually aid the recovery in places like Phoenix, communities like Detroit are faced with the opposite problem. In Detroit, the nexus between decades of population loss and the foreclosure crisis has created a pivotal moment in which the city must reinvent itself. With extensive economic challenges and an infrastructure designed for a much larger population, few easy solutions exist. The city is partnering with community leaders to bring together thousands of residents to help make the tough choices that will shape Detroit's future. Let's turn to Detroit. We are looking forward to a lively conversation, and we thank you for joining us."
