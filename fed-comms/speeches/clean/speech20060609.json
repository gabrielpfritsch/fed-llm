Building on that theme, I will discuss the essential complementarity of technology and economics in modern economies. Finally, I will have a few words to say about what you, as MIT graduates, can do to strengthen our economy and our society even as you pursue your personal and professional goals. A Short History of Economics at MITIf you will bear with me, I would like to begin with a short history of economics at MIT. The MIT Economics Department is, of course, the part of the Institute that I know best, and I hope to persuade you that it has played a special and unique role in this institution. MITâs connection to economics dates at least to 1881, when Francis A. Walker became the institutionâs third president. To say that Walker had already had a distinguished career would be an understatement. He was named a brevet brigadier general at the end of the Civil War, at the age of twenty-four. He served as the superintendent of the 1870 and 1880 Censuses of the United States and was one of the leading economists of his era. The year he arrived at MIT, he taught the first economics course ever offered at the Institute. The course covered political economy and was so popular that it was soon accorded its own course classification as \"Course IX, General Studies.\" Walker helped found the American Economic Association, still the leading professional association for economists. During his tenure at MIT, he moonlighted both as the first president of that association and as president of the American Statistical Association. In the early twentieth century, the economics program at MIT aimed to prepare undergraduates for leadership roles in business. During those years, economics as a discipline was gaining greater prominence both here and abroad. But the modern era of economics at MIT began in 1940--the year that Paul Samuelson, not yet having even received his doctorate, was persuaded to emigrate here from a somewhat less technically proficient institution located on another stretch of the Charles River. In part, Samuelson was willing to leave Harvard because his Foundations of Economic Analysis--a book now universally recognized by economists as inaugurating the modern mathematical approach to economics--was not well received by the old guard at the Harvard Economics Department. MITâs Ph.D. program in economics was established a year after Samuelson arrived. Right from the start, the department attracted strong graduate students: The very first of these, Lawrence Klein, received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1980 for his work in econometric modeling. With support from MITâs administration, the department expanded rapidly after World War II, and MIT led the development of a more mathematically rigorous approach to economics. Given the emphasis on quantitative reasoning at MIT, it makes perfect sense that the Economics Department here was in the vanguard of those using mathematics as a framework for organizing economic thought. Why did economics at MIT become so successful? Perhaps Paul Samuelson and the people he helped to attract here could have been equally successful anywhere. But I suspect that the placement of economics in a milieu where quantitative reasoning and the scientific method are the coin of the realm was an important contributing factor. The Sloan School, with its close links both to the Economics Department and to other parts of the Institute, has benefited from the same milieu and has been the source of many fundamental advances as well. Notably, in recent years the global financial industry has been transformed by new quantitative approaches to pricing complex financial instruments such as derivatives and to measuring and managing risk. This transformation stemmed from the application of formal tools of mathematical economics that were developed to a substantial extent by faculty at the Sloan School, including Fischer Black, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes--the latter two of whom won Nobel Prizes for their work. As MIT economics has benefited from its proximity to the scientific and engineering expertise of MIT, so the Institute has benefited from the presence of a world-class economics department, over and above the addition of still more luster to the MIT name. The exposure of students and faculty from other divisions to the discipline and approaches of economics has stimulated creative thinking about how technology can be used to improve the economic welfare of the average person. That thought brings me to my second topic: the link between technology and economic growth. Translating Technological Advances into Economic GrowthAs has always been the case, technological change and innovation are today in large part driving economic growth and the improvement of living standards. But it is important to understand that even the very best ideas in science or engineering do not automatically translate into broader economic prosperity. In large measure, the material benefits of innovation spring from complementarities between technology and economics, where I include in \"economics\" not only economic ideas but also economic policies and, indeed, the entire economic system. When the economics is right, scientific and technological advances promote economic development, which in turn, in a virtuous circle, may provide resources and incentives that help to foster more innovation. A negative example is the former Soviet Union, which certainly did not lack for scientific and engineering talent but which had an economic system that was poorly suited for translating scientific advances into economic progress. The experience of the United States over the past decade illustrates the essential complementarity of technology and economics, in my view. Before the mid-1990s, the growth of productivity--the amount of output produced per worker or per hour of work--had been relatively sluggish for more than two decades in this country. As productivity is perhaps the single most important determinant of average living standards--a country in which the average worker can produce a lot is usually also a place in which the average person can consume a lot--the so-called productivity slowdown of that earlier period was the source of much concern among economists and policymakers. In the mid-1990s, however, productivity growth picked up in the United States. The growth rate of productivity increased still further around the turn of the century and remains strong today. This productivity revival augurs well for the future of the U.S. economy. But why did it happen? Differences in economic policies and systems likely account for some of the differences in performance--another example of the complementarity of technology and economics. One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity performance is that labor and product markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, and that these market characteristics have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from the new technologies. For example, taking full advantage of new information and communication technologies may require extensive reorganization of work practices, reassignment and retraining of workers, and ultimately some reallocation of labor among firms and industries. Regulations that raise the costs of hiring and firing workers and that reduce employersâ ability to change work assignments--like those in a number of European countries, for example--may make such changes more difficult to achieve. Likewise, in product markets, a high degree of competition and low barriers to the entry of new firms in most industries in the United States provide strong incentives for firms to find ways to cut costs and to improve their products. In some other countries, in contrast, the prominence of government-owned firms with a degree of monopoly power, together with a regulatory environment that protects large incumbent firms and makes the entry of new firms difficult, reduces the competitive pressure for innovation and the application of new ideas. Competition is one of the key benefits of free and open trade; companies that are exposed to global competition tend to be much more efficient and to produce goods of higher quality than companies that are sheltered from international competition. Management practices also differ across countries, and these differences may also matter for productivity. A recent study found that business establishments in the United Kingdom that are owned by U.S. multinationals get higher productivity from information technology than do other establishments, and it tied this differential to the management and organization of U.S. firms.3 Finally, relatively more positive attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States--a factor that spans economics and sociology--may also stimulate innovation and its commercial application as well as economic policies that support innovation. Of course, there are factors that may restrain both technological innovation and its commercialization in the United States as well: I would put at the top of the list the relatively poor performance of our K-12 educational system in stimulating interest in and providing solid training in the sciences. One interesting feature of the U.S. and global experience with major innovations is that often a significant amount of time passes between the initial development and diffusion of new technologies and the realization of the associated productivity benefits. Computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, for example, and personal computers came into widespread use beginning in the early 1980s. But until the mid-1990s these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity. Indeed, MITâs Robert Solow famously quipped in 1987 that \"computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.\" Moreover, despite the sharp decline in information-technology investment after the meltdown of tech-sector stocks earlier this decade, the growth rate of productivity actually increased further in recent years, as I mentioned. These long lags raise additional questions about the nature of the links between new technologies and the resulting productivity gains. Looking to the FutureAs graduates of MIT, you will be at the heart of this critical process of developing new technologies and taking them to the marketplace. We are in an age in which technology and its fruits will be a dominant force not only in our economic lives but in the cultural, social, political, and personal aspects of our lives as well. Your training at MIT equips each of you exceptionally well to take the fullest advantage of the professional and personal opportunities that technological innovation and change will create. In the personal sphere, as you make your way in the world, I hope you will not forget the importance of your family and how much it has already contributed to your journey through life. Remember, too, family members are the ones who will still love you even when things arenât going so well. Even as you focus intensively on your professional interests, I hope you will remain intellectually broad--well-read, well-informed, and open to new experiences. And finally, I hope you will remain engaged with the broader society. That may involve entering public service at some point, as many MIT graduates have chosen to do. But it need not. There are always opportunities to make a difference in the world, through volunteering, civic participation, charitable activities, or the type of work you choose to do. I congratulate all graduates and your families for what you have accomplished and wish you the very best for the future. Footnotes 1.
