  "text": "With the benefit of hindsight, we can now answer the question: Do policymakers have adequate and reliable data sufficient to assess market conditions and craft policy responses? HMDA has three purposes. One purpose is to provide the public and government officials with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. A second is to help government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is needed. A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a spectrum of vantage points. We look forward to the comments of our panelists today and at the upcoming hearings in San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington. This input, together with written comments submitted from the public, will be carefully considered as we consider changes to Regulation C. July 15, 2010 Back to Top"
