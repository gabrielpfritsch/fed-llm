  "text": "Thank you, President Williams. And thank you to everyone who took the time to join us here today to offer your feedback.1 It is my pleasure to be here in Albany, a region of the country that has been so critical to the growth of our nation's economy. One of the aspects I enjoy most about my job is having the opportunity to visit every region of the country and see how the economy is unfolding on the ground. I am happy to be able to do that again today. Now the primary purpose of this event is for me and President Williams to listen to you, so I will stop here, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you again. 1.
