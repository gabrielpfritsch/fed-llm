  "text": "It is an honor to be a part of the inaugural Sadie T. M. Alexander conference in economics and related fields. I want to thank each of you in this room and those of you livestreaming who form the Sadie Collective. Special thanks go to Mykelle Richburg, Kayla Jones, Olusayo Adeleye, George-Ann Ryan, Jada Houser, Fanta Traore, and Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman for taking the initiative and launching this organization and this conference to increase the representation of black women in the field of economics. I applaud your efforts, and I support your mission.1 The story of Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander is an inspiration for us all. A woman of firsts--the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in economics and the first woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania--she was a pioneer who knocked down some daunting doors. The question for the women in this room here today is whether you will follow her through those doors and maybe knock down a few of your own. Why Consider a Career in Economics? I have discussed why it is important for the Federal Reserve and for our economy to see more women of color embracing the field of economics. But what's in it for you? There are many ways your career may unfold where economics might fit in it. Some of you may decide your passion lies elsewhere as an undergraduate, and later find that advanced studies in economics align with your career interests. Others may already feel that economics is your calling. And just as there are a variety of reasons that people decide to deepen their studies in economics, so too there are many career fields where a degree in economics can be a powerful enabler. In my case, although I did not have an undergraduate economics degree, I later decided to pursue advanced study in economics because it provided a rigorous analytical framework and approach to data to address important problems facing America. Growing up, I saw how every family's well-being is affected by their financial resilience and their economic opportunities. I decided to study economics because it provides powerful tools to help promote a better future for many Americans. I have found different ways to approach that throughout my career--from teaching the next generation of problem solvers, to assessing the challenges facing American manufacturers, to seeing the potential of microfinance for financial inclusion, to promoting maximum employment and stable inflation in my current job. So what might you find by pursuing economics? As I have noted, you can influence people's lives for the better. You can craft policy to change our world. You can teach and help shape the next generation. You can find the answers to questions that matter most to you. You can develop the intellectual framework and tools that will enable you to pursue a range of opportunities, not just in economics, but also in business, finance, policy, and nonprofits. Conclusion I hope you will take away the message that the field of economics would be the richer from your engagement and has much to offer as you decide how to make your contribution. There are many opportunities for you in the field of economics, both here and abroad, in government, academia, and the private sector. Dr. Sadie Alexander knocked down the door, and I hope you will consider following her through it. 1. I want to thank Fanta Traore and Nancy Riley for their assistance in preparing this text.
