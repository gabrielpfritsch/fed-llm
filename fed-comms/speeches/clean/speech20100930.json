Share On behalf of my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System, I want to thank you for joining us today. As educators, your work is critical to our economy and our nation. Well-prepared students make for a productive and innovative workforce and a well-functioning democracy. The economist Alfred Marshall said that economics is the study of people in the ordinary business of life.1 What could be more fundamental? Learning about economics helps students understand how the decisions of millions of people about what to produce and consume determine what Adam Smith called \"the wealth of nations\"--our living standards.2 In particular, economics helps students understand both the strengths and the shortcomings of our market-based economic system. I am sure that your students have been eager to understand the economic and financial events of the past few years. The recent financial crisis was among the most profound challenges to economic and financial stability since the Great Depression, and its causes and its ultimate remedies have been, and will continue to be, widely debated. The study of economics will allow your students to join the debate in a responsible and informed way. Thank you for accepting the invitation to join us in this conversation. I appreciate the time you are spending away from personal and professional commitments to be with us. And, as a central banker, economist, educator, and parent, I thank you for your work. I also applaud the ongoing partnerships between regional Reserve Banks and educators, and I would like to express my appreciation to the Federal Reserve staff for their work in coordinating our discussion today. I look forward to your questions. 1. See Alfred Marshall ([1890] 1910), Principles of Economics, 6th ed. (London: Macmillan), p. 1. Return to text 2.
