  "text": "Today, I would like to highlight the excellent work being done in this area by our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). I will also touch on some ways that the banking system and private sector can support financial inclusion. Today, we will focus on their important work to enhance financial access. As the chair of the Consumer and Community Affairs Committee, I oversee these efforts. As many of you know well, DCCA's financial inclusion work is expansive, and I look forward to highlighting these contributions with you today. DCCA also prioritizes the work of mission-driven organizations in its efforts to expand financial inclusion. The Partnership for Progress (PFP) program is the Federal Reserve's Minority Depository Institution (MDI) outreach program created to support the System's mandate to preserve and promote MDIs. DCCA, in collaboration with other areas of the Federal Reserve, engages MDIs and Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs) through national outreach efforts. The PFP provides technical assistance to help MDIs and WDIs address unique business model challenges, enabling these institutions to compete more effectively in the marketplace.4 Third, DCCA ensures that financial institutions under the Fed's jurisdiction comply with laws and regulations that protect consumers and promote community development, including fair lending laws and the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices. For example, DCCA examines state member banks for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, gender, marital status, age, or another prohibited basis. The division's work to protect consumers from harm furthers our goal to create an economy that works for everyone. Data from the most recent SHED report found that 10 percent of adults with family incomes less than $50,000 per year used payday, pawn, auto title, or tax refund anticipation loans to obtain needed funds.5 These types of products often carry high or even punitive direct and indirect costs and risks to the consumer. For example, non-repayment of an auto title loan can lead to vehicle repossession further complicating the consumer's financial situation. When banks offer small dollar loans, they can often do so on terms that are safer and at lower cost than other types of loans.6 Some banks that offer small dollar loan products often use automated underwriting based on alternative information that can include consumer-permissioned cash-flow data. If used appropriately, this approach can reduce bank underwriting costs, potentially making affordably priced loans available to consumers on a more timely basis. If these loans were more available in the banking system, they could serve as an alternative to more costly options from alternative financial services providers. Small dollar loans targeted to low- and moderate-income consumers have the potential to provide an accessible and more fairly priced alternative when consumers experience a financial emergency. However, for those who send funds abroad using remittances, the costs can be substantial. For example, the average cost of sending $200 internationally from the U.S. is nearly 6 percent.8 In addition to broader work on cross-border payments, the G20 countries have reaffirmed a commitment to reducing average remittance fees to below 3 percent by 2030. This could result in a greater proportion of funds reaching recipients.9 Continued improvements to domestic and international payment systems and responsible innovation can further support our work on financial inclusion. Conclusion Greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve. While we have made great progress, there is more to be done for both the public and private sectors. We should be open to considering how new or innovative products and services could promote financial inclusion. We should also be willing to engage with a wide range of stakeholders. Financial access and inclusion are not one-size-fits-all and can look very different to each consumer. Therefore, involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and crafting solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today. 1.
