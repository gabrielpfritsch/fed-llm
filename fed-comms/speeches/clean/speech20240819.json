Thank you, Matt. I am delighted to welcome you all in person to the 2024 Summer Workshop on Money, Banking, Payments, and Finance, jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of Canada, and the Study Center Gerzensee.1 I want to thank the organizers for putting together such an interesting program and also thank the participants for their contributions. Keeping with the tradition of studying exchange and payment, several papers to be presented this year focus on how frictions in financial markets, such as asymmetric information or asset illiquidity, matter for the transmission and implementation of monetary policy as well as unemployment and inflation. Similarly, it is great to continue seeing work studying frictional intermediation in asset markets and the implications for asset prices and the efficient sharing of risk. These contributions push the frontier of our knowledge, facilitate our understanding of real-world complexities, and inform policy thinking. Other concepts are newer and more novel. As the monetary and financial ecosystem has evolved, so has this workshop, bringing together many perspectives and modeling approaches to money and banking theory and its applications. One recurring theme has been to pay special attention to micro-foundations and institutional details, which is important to rigorously analyze and understand today's financial innovations and evaluate their implications for welfare and policy. An important point to remember this week is that no single field of study can give the answers to all of the big questions we face relating to the evolution of money and banking. Commingling of insights and techniques from monetary theory, finance theory, and other fields is vital in studying the complex interactions of modern financial systems. Of course, it is also important to test our theories with available data, and many papers we will see this week deliver on that count as well. Without further ado, let's get started. I hope you have a great week of engaging discussions, and I'm sure we will learn a lot from this year's workshop. 1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. Return to text"
