<p>It is a pleasure to join you once again at the annual convention of the American Bankers Association.ï¿½By any
measure, banking in the United States today is strong, vibrant, and profitable.ï¿½ However, a number of times in the past
half-century, many informed observers questioned the long-term viability of
commercial banking.ï¿½ U.S. commercial banks, which began the
post-World War II period as the dominant financial institution, soon faced
intense competition from thrifts, from new forms of mutual funds, from customer
direct financing in the securities markets, from foreign banks, and from a wide
range of nondepository lenders.ï¿½ As the competition intensified, banks found
their ability to respond increasingly constrained by rules and regulations
established in the far different environment of the Great Depression of the
1930s.ï¿½ And banking, just like other businesses, faced the implications of
immense changes in technology and of the rapid growth in globalization, which created
new risks as well as new opportunities.ï¿½ Under the circumstances, the present
health of banking is a dramatic testament to both the management skills of
bankers and the ability of regulators and legislators to adapt, albeit slowly,
to change.
</p>

<p>
This morning, I would like to review some of the
major innovations and changes that have propelled banks to their present state
and have allowed them successfully to navigate through a rapidly changing
economic and technical environment.
</p>

<p>
A further word of prologue, however, is necessary
to understand todayï¿½s banking markets.ï¿½ What turned out to be bad credit
judgments, especially in real estate, energy, and foreign credit markets,
coupled with high interest rates and a deep recession, led to the assisted acquisitions
of almost 120 banks and the actual demise of about 1,250 of them between 1985
and 1992.ï¿½ Many more had a near-death experience, and survivors recapitalized
by raising $176 billion of new long-term capital, including $13 billion of
equity, from 1991 to 1995.ï¿½ The managers of these surviving organizations had
deeply impressed upon them anew the need to manage risks, to control costs, to
build capital and reserves, and generally to focus on the lessons of banking
history.ï¿½ The passage of time no doubt has caused the experience to fade for
those banks that looked into an abyss, but survived; nevertheless the systems
and procedures that were put into place by many institutions remains one of the
hallmarks of todayï¿½s banking industry.
</p>

<p>
<strong>To Fund or Not to Fund</strong><br>
The first response to the changing environment
after World War II occurred in the early 1960s, with banksï¿½ decision to
actively compete on a price basis to buy money to fund operations--the
development of the negotiable certificate of deposit (CD).ï¿½ For years preceding
the 1960s, banks had no reason to aggressively seek deposits.ï¿½ During the Great
Depression, credit demands on banks, of course, were unusually low, and during
and immediately after World War II banks were extremely liquid owing to heavy accumulations
of U.S. government securities, an aftermath
of war-time financing.ï¿½ The decision to compete on a price basis using
instruments such as the negotiable CD seems quaint today, but in the early
1960s it represented a sea change in the way managers thought about the
business of banking.ï¿½ And its implications turned out to be far reaching.ï¿½ It
was a modest step forward to the whole range of nondeposit and price-sensitive
borrowing, from the repurchase agreement to the subordinated debenture, not to
mention the NOW account and the range of retail time deposits that banks
routinely tap by adjusting offering rates when additional funding is needed.ï¿½
Many of these instruments, including the large-denomination, market-rate-based
deposit, that was once thought to be only for large banks, are now used, with
great success, by community banks when their core deposits fall short of their
funding needs.</p>

<p>
Indeed, banks of all sizes will never again be
the passive deposit takers that they were at the beginning of the 1960s.ï¿½ To be
sure, the whole range of services and characteristics of bank claims are
important, but banks now both can and do look at the cheapest source first and
pay at the margin what is necessary to obtain the needed funding.
</p>

<p>
When deposit rate ceilings--Regulation Q--first
constrained the ability of banks to pay the market rate on CDs in the
mid-1960s, banks shifted to a source that was then unconstrained, the
Eurodollar market.ï¿½ This step not only underlined the increasing importance of
globalization but also finally required legislators and regulators to consider
the efficacy and policy implications of deposit rate ceilings.ï¿½ Only the
inability of thrifts to sustain deposit inflows with the high rates of the
mid-1960s and the late 1970s, an important cause of the later thrift crisis,
kept the eroding deposit rate ceilings from being eliminated until the 1980s.ï¿½
But the principle slowly began to be established that regulations that are
inconsistent with market realities cannot be sustained indefinitely, although
vestiges may remain long beyond the regulationsï¿½ perceived usefulness.
</p>

<p>
The pricing of liabilities was not the only
response of banks to the new competition.ï¿½ Another was the securitization of
consumer and residential mortgage loans--the conversion of a pool of credits into a security--that
others not necessarily other banks, could hold.ï¿½ Securitization also allowed
the creating bank to remove the underlying loans from its books.ï¿½ The bank, or
an affiliate, might provide limited recourse or take an equity position in the
pool to provide a credit enhancement, but the concept was clearly to eliminate
the need for funding while profiting from fees or rate spread.ï¿½ The syndicated
commercial loan soon followed the initial securitizations, with the managing
bank acting more like the lead underwriter on behalf of a syndicate, a
syndicate that, I might add, increasingly is composed of nonbank financial
institutions.
</p>

<p>
Some observers at the time, projecting these
developments, concluded that the bank of the future would hold virtually no
assets, would require virtually no funding, and would have no branches.ï¿½ The
vision that the bank of the future would be essentially an underwriter of
diverse credits has not come to pass, despite the continued growth of
securitization and syndication, because taking credit risk, the historic core
of banking, remains profitable for those that know how to manage it
effectively.ï¿½ In addition, with better pricing, deposits have been restored as
a more-resilient funding source.ï¿½ Moreover, the market test has clearly
underlined the customer desire for branches at most types of banking
organizations.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pricing and Managing Risk</strong><br>
One of the more painful lessons learned in the
1970s and 1980s is that accepting narrow or nonexistent spreads in order to
retain market share is a losing strategy.ï¿½ This lesson seems clear enough, but
many banks were nevertheless reluctant to see traditional customers shift to
other markets, let alone other banks, and matched loan rates despite the resultant
lackluster returns on equity.ï¿½ Competition in the loan market can still be
intense, as it is today.ï¿½ Nonetheless, even with narrowing margins most
recently, loan pricing is now generally linked to careful assessment of
economic returns that often includes an assessment of the profitability of the
credit and the overall relationship.
</p>

<p>
Loan officers, if left to their own devices,
might be more interested in booking loans than in evaluating risk and pricing
loans commensurately.ï¿½ But, pricing, credit decisions, and risk measurement and
management at those banking organizations displaying best practices have
increasingly been based on systems and procedures that impose a quantifiable
discipline.ï¿½ That discipline, in turn, has given the credit-risk manager the
ability to make the case for absolute and relative risk, enabling the bank to <em>choose</em>
its risk profile rather than having it imposed by events.ï¿½ Quantification of
risk has contributed to a changing balance of power between loan officers and
credit-risk managers.
</p>

<p>
We have already begun to see the benefits of this
new balance.ï¿½ The tightening of lending standards by banks has historically
occurred at, or most often after, cyclical peaks, accentuating the decline in
economic activity.ï¿½ Before our most recent recession, however, banks began to
be more selective lenders in response to the data indicating cumulating
deterioration in borrower balance sheets.ï¿½ The volatility of interest rates in
1998 associated with the Asian crisis and the Russian default, as well as
cautions from the regulatory community, also provided a useful early warning,
and the memory of the painful losses of the late 1980s and early 1990s
contributed importantly to the response of bank management.ï¿½ But, in my
judgment, better risk measurement and risk management were noticeably important
in moderating overall credit losses during the most recent recession and in
establishing the higher credit standards that have been so important in the
most recent years.
</p>

<p>
The supervisory authorities are seeking, as you
know, to build on these best practices of banks in developing the new capital
rules, Basel II.ï¿½ The improving bank practices, coupled with the new rules,
hold out the hope of a safer and stronger banking system contributing to a more
stable economy.ï¿½ We anticipate that the best practices and procedures will
spread beyond the largest banks, even to those entities that are not required
to adopt the new capital rules.
</p>

<p>
No discussion of better risk management would be
complete without mentioning derivatives and the technologies that spawned them
and so many other changes in banking and finance.ï¿½ Derivatives have permitted
financial risks to be unbundled in ways that have facilitated both their
measurement and their management.ï¿½ Because risks <em>can</em> be unbundled, individual
financial instruments can now be analyzed in terms of their common underlying
risk factors, and risks can be managed on a portfolio basis.ï¿½ Concentrations of
risk are more readily identified, and when such concentrations exceed the risk
appetites of intermediaries, derivatives and other credit and interest rate
risk instruments can be employed to transfer the underlying risks to other
entities.ï¿½ As a result, not only have individual financial institutions become
less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors, but also the financial
system as a whole has become more resilient.
</p>

<p>
Derivatives have been used effectively by many
banks to shift interest rate risks.ï¿½ In addition, while credit risks are
transferred among financial intermediaries based on their ability and
willingness to absorb such risk, increasingly credit risk has been transferred
from highly leveraged financial institutions to those with much larger equity
coverage.ï¿½ For example, not only has a significant part of the credit risks of
an admittedly few large U.S. banks been shifted to other U.S. and foreign banks
and to insurance and reinsurance firms here and abroad, but such risks also
have been shifted to pension funds, to hedge funds, and to other organizations
with diffuse long-term liabilities or no liabilities at all.ï¿½ Most of the
credit-risk transfers were made early in the credit-granting process; but in
the late 1990s and early in this decade, significant exposures to
telecommunication firms were laid off through credit default swaps,
collateralized debt obligations, and other financial instruments.ï¿½ Other risk
transfers reflected later sales at discount prices as specific credits became
riskier and banks rebalanced their portfolios.ï¿½ Some of these sales were at
substantial concessions to entice buyers to accept substantial risk.ï¿½ Whether
done as part of the original credit decision or in response to changing
conditions, these transactions represent a new paradigm of active credit
management and are a major part of the explanation of the banking system's
strength during the most recent period of stress.ï¿½ Even the largest corporate
defaults in history (WorldCom and Enron) and the largest sovereign default in
history (Argentina) have not significantly impaired the
capital of any major U.S. financial intermediary.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology</strong><br>
Technology, as I have noted, has been among the
most significant factors permitting banks to adjust to the new competitive
environment in making credit decisions, in measuring and managing risk, and in
creating and using new instruments.ï¿½ Technology of course, is a two-edged
sword.ï¿½ The technology that banks use so profitably in risk measurement and
management and in their dealing and underwriting activities is the same that
their rivals and their customers used to deprive banks of the traditional
lending business with their best customers.ï¿½ However, technology has also
allowed banks to assess the credit and other risks of customers previously
deemed too risky and, then, to extend credit profitably to such borrowers.
</p>

<p>
Some investment in bank technology has been
largely defensive, with the gains captured mainly by customers who would
otherwise have shifted to competing institutions.ï¿½ Retail internet banking and,
for some smaller banks, ATMs, are examples.ï¿½ But the use of even these
defensive investments has often yielded benefits for banks from greater fees
and from lower costs resulting from reduced check processing.
</p>

<p>
I would be remiss not to note the more-direct
contributions of technology to increased productivity in banking, the same kind
of improvements that have occurred throughout our economy.ï¿½ Such gains are
notoriously hard to measure in banking, but have visibly contributed to the
improved profitability of banking.ï¿½ Not all such gains have been cost
reducing:ï¿½ Some have increased cost, but have raised revenue even more by
improving the variety and quality of banking services in ways for which
customers are willing to pay.ï¿½ The increase in banksï¿½ fee income is not
unrelated to improvements in technology.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bank Consolidation</strong><br>
Technology has also facilitated consolidation in
banking by making it more efficient at the margin--or perhaps less
inefficient--for firms to become larger, more geographically dispersed, and
better able to manage multiple business lines.ï¿½ Research at the Federal Reserve
and elsewhere is consistent with other indications in the past decade or so of
cost scale economies, or fewer diseconomies, and improved control by multibank
holding companies over their bank subsidiaries.ï¿½ Improvement in the ability of
these organizations to make small business loans over a wider geographical area
is striking.ï¿½ Some of the consolidation of the past decade would not have been
possible if the Congress, led by the states, had not removed prohibitions on
interstate banking and branching.ï¿½ The combination of the resultant
geographical diversification with the product line diversification facilitated
by technology and the removal of out-dated legal prohibitions, has, in my view,
greatly strengthened the stability of our financial system.ï¿½ Diversified
banking organizations in most recent years have been able to absorb substantial
losses in some lines or weak demand for some products without significant hits
to capital or, in some cases, even to earnings.ï¿½ Banking history as recently as
the 1980s and early 1990s would have been quite different had our banking
structure then been more similar to that of today.
</p>

<p>
The recent consolidation of the banking system
has been dramatic.ï¿½ Excluding intra-bank holding company mergers, and including
the approximate 100 announced but not yet completed mergers, about 2,400
banking organizations have been absorbed by other banking entities since 1995.ï¿½
If all the mergers that have been announced are completed, the ten largest
banking organizations in the United States
will account for about 51 percent of all domestic banking assets, almost double
their share in 1995.ï¿½ Consolidation has not been a phenomenon involving only
large banks.ï¿½ Roughly 45 percent of the mergers involved an acquirer <em>and</em> a
target each of which had less than one billion dollars in assets.ï¿½ I must
emphasize that, despite these merger trends, market and other pressures have
kept measures of <em>local</em> market banking concentration virtually unchanged. ï¿½An
important factor has been the almost 1,400 new commercial bank formations since
1995.
</p>

<p>
It would be a mistake to conclude from these
comments that the only way to succeed in banking is through ever-greater size
and diversity.ï¿½ Indeed, better risk management may be the only truly necessary
element of success in banking.ï¿½ The variety in scale, strategy, and approach
among quite profitable and well-capitalized banks in this country is striking.ï¿½
A handful of organizations operate diversified, multi-line, financial service
businesses nationally or globally or both.ï¿½ Others deliver services throughout
a multistate region.ï¿½ Some specialize in credit cards or mortgage finance.ï¿½
Some operate an alliance of smaller, independent organizations through multibank
holding companies, seeking local investors and management.ï¿½ Some insurance,
securities, or investment management firms have become affiliated with banks
with the intention of broadening their product lines.ï¿½ Some banks have large
branch systems whereas others have business plans with no branches, using mail
and ATMs as alternatives.ï¿½ A very few are trying to operate without brick and
mortar, only through the Internet.ï¿½ And, by number, our structure is still
dominated, as it will continue to be, by the community banks that offer local
services through local management, using specialized local information.ï¿½ The
potential for new entrants, we should not forget, is always there and will keep
the existing entities on this non-exhaustive list on their toes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The factors that have contributed to the
strength, resilience, and profitability of the U.S. banking system, which I have described, should continue to guide the
industry in the years ahead.ï¿½ We have, in short, every reason to believe that
banks of all sizes and types will continue to successfully compete in an
ever-changing market environment.ï¿½ Nonetheless, as time passes, more and more
bank managers will not have the first-hand memories of times of banking
stress.ï¿½ That is why we must endeavor to build into bank and regulatory systems
the product of the earlier experiences in order not only to retain and
consolidate the gains made, but also to rapidly incorporate more widely the
future advances that best-practice banks will continue to make.
