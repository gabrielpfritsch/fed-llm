  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good a fternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us : maximum employment and\nprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide\nrelief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my c olleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero\nand maintained our sizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on\ninterest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver\npowerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\nThe path of the econom y continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A\nresurgence in recent months in COVID- 19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great\nhardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation.\nFollowing a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has\nmoderated in recent months , with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most\nadversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing . Household\nspending on services remains low , especially in sectors that typically require people to gather\nclosely, including travel and hospitality. And household spending on goods has moderated\nfollowing earlier large gains.\nIn contrast, t he housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn,\nsupported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing production h ave also picked up. The overall recovery in econom ic activity since last spring is\ndue in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals . The recently enacted C oronavirus\n\nResponse and Relief Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] will provide additional\nsupport . Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic , and the path\nahead remains highly uncertain.\nAs with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has\nslowed in recent months . Employment fell by 140 ,000 in December , as continued gains in many\nindustries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus\nhas weighed further on activity . In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a\nmillion jobs , largely from restaurants and bars. T he unemployment rate remain ed elevated at\n6.7 percent in December, and p articipation in the labor market is notably below pre -pandemic\nlevels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of\nAmericans remain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level\nof joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended man y lives and\ncreated great uncertainty about the future.\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in\nthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.\nWhile we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several\ndevelopments point to an improved outlook for later this year. Sufficiently w idespread\nvaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic\nactivities . In the meantime, continued observance of social -dista ncing measures and wearing\n\nmasks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. S upport from fiscal policy will help\nhouseholds and businesses weather the downturn as well as limit lasting damage to the economy\nthat could otherwise impede the recovery. In addition , as we have seen since last summer, the\neconomy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses. Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will con tinue to do so.\nThe Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Today we unanimousl y reaffirmed our Statement\non Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January. As we say\nin that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad -based and inclusive goal.” Our\nability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having\nlonger -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in to day’s policy statement , with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of m onetary\npolicy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates,\nwe continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range\nfor the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our\nholdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed\n\nsecurities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made\ntoward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. T he increase in our balance sheet\nsince last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to\nthe economy. T he economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is\nlikely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.\nOur forward guidance for the federal funds rate , along with our balance sheet guidance ,\nwill ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery\nprogresses. Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the\nbalance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress\ntoward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a l ower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected\npath of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing\npowerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.\nWe’ve also taken actions to more dir ectly support the flow of credit in the economy,\ndeploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by\nfinancial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act facilities are no —are no longer ope n to new activity , our other facilities remain in place .\nTo conclude, w e understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Jeanna Smialek.\n\nJEANNA SMIALEK . Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.\nThank you for taking our questions. I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that\ngame stock —GameStop ’s stock has had this week. And then, secondarily, you and your\ncolleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the\nfirst line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks. But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks. I ’m wondering what your plan is, if you see som e sort of large\nfinancial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search -for-yield kind of activities. You know, what, what do you see as\nthe solution there? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on, on your first question, I don’ t want to comment on a\nparticular company or, or day ’s market activity or things like that. It ’s just not really something\nthat I would typically comment on.\nIn terms of macroprudential policy tools, s o, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of\nalways- on, through- the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also\nthe elevated levels of liquidity and capital a nd, and , and also resolution planning that we —that\nwe impose on the l argest financial institutions. We don’ t use time -varying tests and tools as\nsome other countries do. And we think it ’s a good approach because— for us to use ones that are\nalways- on— because we don ’t really think we ’d be successful in every case in picking the exact\nright time to intervene in markets. So that ’s for banks.\nYou really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector. And so we monitor financial\nconditions very broadly. And while we don’ t have jurisdiction over , over many areas in the\nnonbank sector, other agencies do. And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability\nOversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for , for nonbank supervision.\n\nAnd, i n fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far. And ,\nand the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the\npandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector. So that ’s—right now we are engaged in, in\ncarefully examining, understanding , and thinking about what , what in the nonbank sector will\nneed to be addressed in the next year or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you . James Politi, FT .\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell. I had a question on\nfiscal policy. Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support a nd, I\nbelieve, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December. We have —\nnow have a new , new President , a new Congress. We have a weakening short -term outlook. Do\nyou believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I guess I ’d start by saying that the , the fiscal response\nthat we ’ve seen to this downturn has be en strong , and I think we can say now that it ’s been\nsustained after th e passage of the—of the , the most recent act in , in late December. And that ’s\nreally a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it ’s been. Fiscal policy has been\nabsolutely essential. When we look back on, on the history of this period, we ’ll see a strong and\nsustained fiscal policy response.\nI would—I would add that we ’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery.\nSomething like 9 m illion people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That ’s\nas many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the G lobal F inancial C risis and the Great\nRecession. Many small businesses are under pressure, and there ar e other needs to be addre ssed.\nAnd the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.\n\nSo, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for\nCongress and the A dministration and not for the Fed. And these discussions are going on right\nnow. So there ’s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions,\nand, and that ’s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you . Steve Lies man.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. C hairman. I wonder if I could follow up on\nJeanna’ s question here. I understand that you do address issues of , of valuations through\nmacroprudential policies in the first instance , but there ’s a range of assets . And I know you do\nwatch a range of assets. But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to\nsome of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop , how do you address the\nconcern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates— are\npotential ly fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me —let me provide a little context. The shock that the —from\nthe pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of\nunemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity. There ’s nothing close to it\nin our modern economic history. So our response was really to that . And we—we ’ve done what\nwe could, first , to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the\nrecovery. And , hopefully, we ’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer -run\ndamage to the —to the economy.\nOur role assigned by Congress is maximum employment a nd stable prices and also look\nafter financial stability. So, in a world where , almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9 million\njobs, at least —that ’s one way of counting i t; it can actually be counted much higher than that —\nshort of maximum employment an d people are out of the labor force who were in the labor\n\nforce —the real unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you include people that ’ve left the\nlabor force —it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to\nsupport maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent\nand averaging 2 percent over time.\nSo, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework. We don’ t look at one\nthing or two things. We look at —and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so\nthat it c ould be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable. And , you know, the\nthings that we look at are —we do look at asset prices. We also look at leverage in the banking\nsystem. We look at leverage in the non—the nonbanking system, which is to say , corporates and\nhouseholds. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at it across that range of , of, of\nreadings, they’ re each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial\nstability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.\nOur overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to , to shocks of all\nkinds, that it ’s strong and resilient. And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds\nand, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well. So when we get to the\nnonfinancial sector, we don’ t—we don’t have jurisdiction over that.\nBut—so I would just say that our —that there are many things that go in, as you know, to,\nto setting asset prices. So if you look at what ’s really been driving asset prices, really , in the last\ncouple of months , it isn ’t monetary policy. It’s been expectations about vaccines. And it ’s also\nfinancial— sorry, fiscal policy . Those are —those are the news items that have been driving ,\ndriving asset purchases —sorry, asset values in , in recent months.\nSo I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there , but that ’s how we look at it.\nAnd I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and , and asset\n\nvalues is probably something that ’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of —a lot of\ndifferent factors are driving asset prices at any given time.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don’ t mind ? Mr. Chairman, do\nyou rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to\naddress asset values?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, that ’s—as you know, that ’s one of the very difficult\nquestions in all of monetary policy. And we don ’t rule it out as a theoretical matter , but we , we\nclearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in , in addressing financial stability issues. It’s not —you know, the ,\nthe monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well -\nunderstood channels. And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stabilit y.\nThat will mean strong, you know, well -capitalized institutions , and, and households will be —\nwill be working. And , and so we know that.\nWe don’ t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you\nraise interest rates and ther eby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in\norder to address asset bubbles and things like that , what —will that even help? Will it —will it\nactually cause more damage, or will it help? So I think that ’s unresolved. And I , I think it ’s, it’s\nsomething we , we look at as not , not theoretically ruled out but not something we , we—we ’ve\never done a nd not something we would plan to do. We would rely on macroprudential and other\ntools to deal with financial stability issues.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.\n\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yes. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, if there is a near -\nterm rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it ’s\nsomething that ’s temporary or more enduring? And how much inflation is the F ed willing to\ntolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on inflation, a couple of things —there are a couple of things that\nare worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 -month\nbasis. And as we —as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year,\nwe’ll see measured 12 -month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just —they’ re called base\neffects , and, and that ’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.\nThere ’s also the possibility —indeed, it ’s in some forecasts— that as the economy fully\nreopens, there ’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the\npandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.\nNow, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. I n\nboth cases, we d on’t see those as either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react\nis, we’re going to be patient. Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we\nwould review —we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.\nI think if you —you know, it helps to look back at , at the inflation dynamics that the\nUnited States has had now for some decades a nd notice that there has been, you know,\nsignificant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has\naveraged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century. And the inflation dynamics , with the flat\nPhillips c urve and low persistence of inflation , is very much intact. Those things, they change\nover time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’ t\n\nchange rapidly. So we think it ’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you\nknow, troubling inflation.\nOf course, if w e did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have\ntools for that. It’ s far harder to deal with , with too low inflation. We know what to do with\nhigher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we , we would have those tools. And\nwe don’ t expect to see that at all.\nIn terms of how much, you know, what we ’ve said is we ’d like to see —because inflation\nhas been running persistently below 2 percent , we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent\nfor some time. We have no t adopted a formula. We’re not going to adopt a formula. We’re\ngoing to—w e, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly,\nbut we don’ t set policy by them. We don ’t do that. And so we ’re going to preserve an element\nof judgment.\nAnd, again, we ’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we ’ll,\nwe’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent . The , the way to achieve\ncredibility on that is to actually do it. And so that ’s what we ’re planning on doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. R achel Siegel .\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I have a two -pronged question about vaccines. So you specifically mentioned\nprogress in the rollout of vaccines , but there is still plenty that we don ’t know about supply over\nthe coming weeks and months. So I ’m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in\nvacci ne rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like.\nAnd then, secondly, I ’m wondering if you, yourself haven’t —has been —have been\nvaccinated , along with other FOMC members. Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So , in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else\nsees, right? We see that we’ re, we’re vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day,\napparently , and that it’ll take quite a while to get —to get to the numbers that the expert s say are\nrequired to get to herd immunity. And we think it ’s going to be a struggle.\nYou’ll notice that we , we said that the , the pandemic still, still provides considerable\ndownside risks to the economy. And that’s one of the reasons why, is that —is th e slowness of\nthe rollout. The other —another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains. We\ndon’t know how to—we do n’t know how to model that. You know, we can have a base case, but\nwe realize no one knows how the —how this new vaccine wil l roll out, how successful it will be,\nhow high we ’ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things.\nSo we have a base case, and we —but we always —we always look at , at the range of\npossibilities. In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks. You know, that ’s really\nwhat we do is , we, we set policies so that we’re , we’re, you know , we’re going to remain\naccommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in\nthe data. So that’s, that ’s how we think about , about that.\nAnd I would—I would also add, there ’s nothing more important to the economy now\nthan, than people getting vaccinated. You know, if you—if you, you think about the places\nwhere the economy is weak—I mentioned bars and restaurants . That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last\nmonth, a nd that ’s all because of the spread of the pandemic. Many other areas of the economy —\nactually, there was actually job creation in —you know, in goods production and in some service\nparts —industries as well. But we ’re just not going to be able to get that last group of people\nback to work—and it ’s a big group of people —until we get the pandemic behind us.\n\nWe, we have not won this yet. We haven ’t succeeded in doing this yet , and we need to\nstay focused on it as a country and , and get there . And, you know, we clearly can, but we ’re\ngoing to have to stay focused. A nd that includes —you know, that includes us at the F ed,\nmonetary policy.\nI, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. M ichael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . A question— I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need\nto follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential , and that is,\nyou have one tool you can use . Would you be discussing— have you discussed raising margin\nrequirements under R egulation T? And, if not, why not?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, we haven’ t—we haven’t done that. I mean, remember, we ’re,\nwe’re focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it— the\nbroad financial sector. And, and that —that’s not, you know —over the years, we, we consult the\nfact that we have that authority. But , no, it ’s not something we ’re loo king at right now at all.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . All right. My follow -up question is, a lot of people in the markets\nthink that you’ re basically stuck right now, because you can’ t really go lower with the zero\nbound, rejecting negative interest rates , and you ca n’t really go higher because of the thr eat of a\ntaper tantrum. Is the F ed locked into a very narrow corridor now? And , if not, you did say you\nwould signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead. But [former] New York F ed\nPresident Bill Dudley s ays there ’s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum. So how do you do\nthat?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, first , I—we , we think our policy stance is , is just right. We\nthink it ’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. We, you know, we , we\nadopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August. In\nSeptember, we, we implemented rate guidance that , that was consistent wit h and based on that\nnew framework. In December, we did the same for asset purchases.\nSo we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that ’s\nproviding very strong support for economic activity. If you look at the sectors of t he economy\nthat are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity : housing, durable goods, automobile\nsales. So, you know, our , our policies are working. And we think that , that they are —we think\nour policy stance is , is right.\nThat said, there’ s clearly more that we can do. With asset purchases, for example, we\ncan, you know —that ’s, that’s a tool we can do more —we can strengthen our guidance , too, if we\nwere to think that that were appropriate. What you see is an economy where what ’s holding it\nback is not the lack of , of policy sup port from the F ed. It’ s the pandemic . It’s, it’s the spread of\nthe disease and people ’s reluctance or , or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic\nactivities, which amount to a , a meaningful part of the economy. So that ’s, that’s what I would\nsay. We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we ’re—we think we’re in the\nright place.\nYou know, in terms of —in terms of tapering, it ’s just premature. We just created the, the\nguidance. We said we ’d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we\nmodify our , our asset purchase guidance. It ’s just too early to be talking about dates, which we\nshould be focused on, on progress. We’ll need to see actual progress. And when, when we see\nourselves getting to that point, we ’ll communicate clearly about it to , to the public so nobody\n\nwill be surprised when the time comes. And we ’ll do that well in advance of actually\nconsidering what will be a pretty gradual taper.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Well, if I might, you—your policies are working, and you can\nmaybe do more. But the question is, can you stop doing it when it ’s time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So, you know, I , I was here—we had all the same questions\nback in —after the G lobal F inancial Crisis. We raised interest rates . We froze the balance sheet\nsize, and then we shrank the balance sheet size. So there ’s no reason why we , we won ’t be able\nto do that again. In fact, we learned a lot from that experience.\nAnd, you know, we , we understand —as we understood then, but even more so—we\nunderstand that the —that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to , to do\npredictab le things, and to move gradually. And that ’s, that’s what we ’re going to do. We’ re\ngoing to be very transparent.\nBut, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature , if I may say. We ’re\nfocused on finishing the job we ’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy\nthe support it needs. There are people out there who’ ve lost their jobs. It’s essential that we get\nthem back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that. And\nthat is our primary focus right now. It ’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be —to be worried about that. You\nknow, when we come to exit, we have a —we have an understanding of how to do that , and we ’ll\ndo it very carefully. But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a\nsecond. You know, we just had a $900 billion package , and now Congress is talking about doing\n\nmore. Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary? And , specifically, how\nworried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I would say that , again, we have been struggling with\ndisinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world—look in Western Europe,\nlook at Japan—around the world, large economies have , have felt much more downward\npressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals , for some time now. That is the\nbroad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.\nAnd we believe that those global forces —which are, you know, aging demographics,\nadvancing technology, and globalization—those , those forces are still in effect. Now, they may\nslow down, a nd, and it ’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example,\nglobalization may slow down or even reverse. Notwithstanding that , inflation dynamics in the\nUnited States have , have consis ted of a flat Phillips c urve and low persistence for , for a long\ntime. We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over\ntime, but significant time. You know, these things are —these things are, are changing, but they\ndon’t change at a rapid rate. And there’s —I, I don’t believe that , that they will.\nSo I wouldn’t —I’m, I’m not —I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete\nrecovery and losing people ’s careers and lives that they —that they built because they don ’t get to\nwork —back to work in time and things like that. I’m more concerned about that and the damage\nthat will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of\nthe economy. I ’m more concern ed about that than about the possibility, which exists , of higher\ninflation. Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of\ntroubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems , seems far away and unlikely in, in\nthe both domestic and global context that we ’ve been in for some time.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Matthews, Bloomberg.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her\nemployees yesterday, spoke of the close working re lationship with the Federal Reserve. And I ’m\nwondering how you would describe the relationship with , with Treasury under Chair Yellen , if\nyou’ve met with, with , with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has\ntaken office .\nAnd, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was\nconstant criticism from the —of the F ed from the P resident and from other officials of the\nAdministration. Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now b e more of\na hands -off attitude , in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the A dministration?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay . So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary\nYellen. And I ’m, I’m sure that we ’re going to have a , a good working relati onship together.\nAbsolutely sure. We ’ll also have a good institut ional relationship between the F ed and the\nTreasury. And I expect that that ’ll be very good and, and very productive. It’ll be collaborative .\nWe’ll work together.\nNow, the way that works is , is that, you know, we know —the agencies know each other\nwell, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world. We know to stay\nin our lanes. We know we have different authorities. We know that we work together on some\nthings to —you know, for the benefit of the public. And I ’m, I’m absolutely sure that we ’re\ngoing to do that.\nI, you know, haven’ t—I haven’t spoken to, to Secretary Yellen —I’m going to be calling\nher “ Chair Yellen ” most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me —Secretary Yellen . I\nhaven’ t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated. I do expect very soon to\n\nbegin our regular calls or —and, and ultimately meetings , which have gone on, really , for, you\nknow, 70 years. T he Treasury Secretary and the, and the Fed Chair have had weekly or so\nmeetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation. So I expect that will —that will\nhappen soon.\nI’ve—I have not met the , the President, President Biden. And just , you know, I , I,\nI don’ t—I don’t have any comment on your —on your last question. I wouldn’ t want to\ncomment one way or the other.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up brief ly, you have some 13(3) emergency\nprograms that will expire March 31 that the F ed and the Treasury have worked on together. Do\nyou have an expectation of whether those will be left , left to expire then or whether they will be\nextended?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I —I’ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in\nsupporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved —protected the loss of\nmillions of jobs. We’ re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout\nthe economy. And , and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that\nlaw, then our emergency lending tools will remain available.\nNow, I ’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’ t had\nany discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet —you know, high- level meetings with\nthe—with the transition team a month or so ago. And once we start having those , those\nmeetings, of course, I ’ll observe, you know, the long- standing practice of not talking about\nconfidential discussions. But as of now, there haven’ t been any discussions at all.\nMICHE LLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider, Reuters.\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this. So a couple questions\non timing. In the statement , you removed—regarding the c oronavirus —you removed the time\nreference “short and medium term ” when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook , and it\nsimply now says “considerable risks to the economic outlook. ” Should we read that as a sort of a\npositive change that you , you now see an end—sort of the endgame of this down the road? Or is\nit more that you ’re, you’re worried it could last longer than you expect? And a related issue ,\nhave you given any guidance yet to the F ed staff or S ystem on whe n the F ed itself might resume\nin-person event s?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “ in the\nmedium term, ” because , really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly. You know, a s I\nmentioned, it ’s the rollout of the vaccine. It ’s the arrival of new strains that, that are more\ncontagious and perhaps more virulent. And those are the —those are the —and also just the\nongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus. It ’s, it’s in the near term . It’s\nnot in the medium term. We were thinking —when we were thinking “ medium term, ” we were\nthinking of longer -term scarring and things like that.\nNonetheless, I mean, I think what —to go to your , your second question, and as I\nmentioned in my, in my opening r emarks —there is good evidence to, to support a stronger\neconomy i n the second half of this year. In fact, if you look at , at—as we do —look at a range of\nprivate forecasters, what was their forecast in , in December , and what ’s their forecast now?\nRight ac ross the board : much higher forecast s for 2021 growth. And that ’s because of the\nongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations , and the reality of ,\nof the CRR A Act [ Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done . So there is—there is a\npositive case there.\n\nBut that —think of that as —the sort of base case is, is a strong economy in the second half\nof the year. The language says that there’ s still —I forget the exact language —downside risks .\nWe used an adjective. It was “ considerable” —“considerable risk s to the economic outlook.” So\nthere are considerable risk s, risks to the economic outlook. Nonetheless, that is —that is a more\npositive outlook. And that ’s really how , how I would—I would parse that for you.\nI don’ t know when we ’re going to come back to work, and I ’m, I’m actually in the Eccles\nBuilding here today. And I don’ t know when that ’ll be. I mean, we—I can ’t wait to be working\nin person again. But , you know, we —we ’ve been able to work successfully remotely. We really\nhave . And, you know, we ’re not going to push people when they’ re uncomfortable. We’ re\ngoing to wait til l peopl e are comfortable and wait til l it’s well and truly time to get back together\nin person.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHEL LE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. The\nFed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases. And\nso I wanted to ask what factors the F ed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay\nout in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay . So we ’re, we’re monitoring that on an ongoing basis,\ncontinue to —continuing to evaluate our , our restrictions . And we haven’ t made a decision about\nwhether to continue them in the second quarter or not. We ’re just going to look at ba nk—w e’re\ngoing to look at the whole range of , of information , including economic activity, banking\nactivity, the , the success in vaccination. All of those things will go into our assessment of what\nthe right answer is to that question.\n\nI think we ’ve been careful about , about rolling back those restrictions. And, and I ’m\npleased with where we are. L et’s remember that the banks —that the banks that are subject to the\nstress tests have taken very, very large reserves— very large loss reserves, and also increa sed\ntheir capital . They’ve actually had— they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here. And, and—but , you\nknow, we ’re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data , and all of the\ndata, when we make that decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question. So I ’m\ninterested in the housing sector. Home prices are rising , 9 percent in some areas, because of low\ninterest rates. Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet? And is there a price\nincrease, you know, that you’ re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage -backed\nsecurities the Fed is buying? And , as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt\ncycle more concerning for you?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on housing, you know, housing is now —the level of housing\nactivity is at its highest level since before the Global F inancial C risis, in some measures . So\nwe’ve had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the , the tightness in housing markets , we\nthink—which has led to the , the significant price increases this year —we think is , is a passing\nphenomenon. There was a lot of pent -up demand.\nThere ’s a one- time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in\ntheir house, and they’ re thinking either “ I need a bigger house ” or “I need another house and a\ndifferent house —or a second house ,” in some cases. So there ’s just—there’s a—there’s a one -\ntime shift in demand that we think will get satisfied —also , that will call for th supply. And that\n\nwill—that will, we think —we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for , for\nall of those reasons.\nSo you asked about corporate debt, I guess ?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. I’m just concerned if that ’s a bubble that you’ re\nwatching.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty\ncarefully. And , you know, what ’s happened in, in the corporate debt market , beginning with the\nannouncement of our corporate credit facility, has been , you’ ve seen lenders lending and\nborrowers borrowing. You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we\nexpected. There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning , and those have\nreally slowed down.\nAnd, by the way, the same is true for bank loans. Banks are no t experiencing the kinds of\ndefaults that , that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic. It ’s just not\nmaterializing. So they’ re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually.\nDebts —corporate debt spreads are, are tight. They ’ve tightened. They were very\nbroad—high —wide, of course, at the —during the acute phase of the pandemic , and they’ve —\nyou know, they’ re now at the lower end of their typical range. And we do monitor that.\nYou know, it ’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we\ndo watch those things. And, you know, in a sense, it ’s good that companies have been able to\nfinance themselves during this period, because they—they’ ve been able to stay in business .\nThey’ve been able to keep their employees working. And , you know, that ’s a good thing. And\nthat’s, that’s part of highly accommodative financial conditions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Chris Rugaber.\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thanks. Can you—s ince you suggested that the concern\nfrom th e pandemic is perhaps a shorter -term concern and that ’s why you removed some of the\nlanguage from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you ’re seeing so far?\nDo you feel that structural impacts have been —ho w would you characterize those? I\nknow that ’s been a major concern —you’ve talked about at this press conference and others. Do\nwe see longer -term damage to the job market? Have—or has there been some success in\npreventing that? And , compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage\nto the job market here , in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need\nto shift industries, that kind o f thing?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the , the, the big thing is that the jury ’s out. And this has\nbeen a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people —if, if they become\ndisconnected from the industry or the job where —that they used to work in, it, it can be years or\nnever when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their\ncareers—t he same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’ t have the kind of resources\nthat you need to get through this. S o we ’ve, we’ve had a big concern about , about both of those.\nWe haven ’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared. And that ’s a good thing. But as I\nsaid that, you know, the jury is out here —9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the\npandemic. They’re —a big chunk of them are people who worked in public -facing jobs in the\nservice sector. And, you know, they’ ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from\nmonetary policy.\nBut the question is getting them back to work. And, you know, it ’s, it’s harder if\nyou’re —it takes longer , empirically , to find that next job if you’ re looking at a brand- new\nindustry. It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer. So that just, again, stresses the\n\nurgency that we feel and others feel at, at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the\njob a nd getting back to a place where it ’s safe to have these— you know, to, to , to stay in hotels,\nto fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things.\nSo those people are still at risk. And we ’re, we’re very, very focused on that group of\npeople with our policy a nd, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy. So many\npeople have had that brid ge across the pandemic. You know, we talked about that at the\nbeginning. For many people, it ’s clear that they ’ve made it across, a nd their job is okay , and\ntheir house is okay. And, you know, it ’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are\nclosed and things like that. But there, there ’s a bunch of people yet who haven’ t found that\nbridge yet. And we ’re, we’re very focused on that.\nOf course, the other thing is, we ’re going to a diff erent economy. And we ’re going to be\nlearning more about that as we go. But , clearly, we ’re, we’re learning that things can be done\nfrom remote locations. We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we\nthought. And some of that is happening.\nSo I think as we, you know , as we get into this, you know, the phase after —even after the\neconomy fully reopens, I think we ’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have\nbeen disrupted, because they ’ve lost that —the work that th ey did. And I think it would be wise\nas a country, for the longer -run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for\nthose people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing\nsupport for an additional period of time.\nCHRIST OPHER RUGABER. Great. If I could as k this quick follow —yesterday Susan\nRice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next five\n\nyears and 6 million new jobs. Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the\neconomy? And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and\nwealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact. I think if you look at\neither—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps,\nhomeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even control ling for many other factors,\nyou will see that they ’re, they’re persistent , they’re —and they ’re very difficult to explain.\nAnd so it’s —the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is\nthat it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with ,\nwith—we want —we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can\npossibly be. We want —we want an economy where everybody can take part a nd everybody,\neverybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.\nThat’s what we want. And that ’s how the U .S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster,\nis if we can achieve a more —a broader prosperity.\nSo, now , in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is\none for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play. And, and that is , how we think about the labor market. Principally , whe n we say that the\nmaximum employment is a , a broad and inclusive goal, what we ’re—what we’re saying there is ,\nwe’re not just going to look at the headline —and we never did, really, b ut—we ’re not going to\njust look at the headline numbers. We’re going to l ook at different demographic groups,\nincluding women, minorities , and others. And we ’re not going to say that we ’ve reached\nmaximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we ’ve reached maximum employment.\n\nAnd you haven’t if, if there ’s lots of po ckets of , of people not participating in or not employed in\nthe labor market. S o those are the things that we can do.\nWe also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues. You know, we do—we, we\nhave such a focus on these issues now that we actuall y—we , we have a new , a webpage,\nrelatively new, where you can access all of it. But it ’s a lot of activities in our Division of\nConsumer and Community Affairs. It’s lots of research , and, and it ’s also, you know, our\nenforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that. So I think everybody’ s got a role to\nplay here. It ’s a—it’s a national goal and a national job, a nd we ’re just going to do our part of\nthe job. And it ’s something we ’re strongly committed to.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we ’ll go to Scott Horsley\nat NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. You said in your opening remarks that the ,\nthe economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than people expected , and that that\nreflected the adaptability of both households and businesses. Are, are there adaptations that\ncaught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on- site work, in- person,\nface-to-face work that , that the economy’ s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset\nof this pandemic?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. S o I think, if you go back to the —to the beginning, there\nwas a real concern. I mean, just , just take the financial markets, for example. Suddenly, all of\nthose big buildings all over the , the—New York City and all around the world where people\nwork in the financial markets with terminals and everything , everybody had to go home, and\nthey had to take their terminals with them. And I think there was a real concern that there would\nbe a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under\n\nhistorically difficult conditions. And yet, it worked out okay. So I think pe ople—many people\nin the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading\nfloors or on virtual trading floors.\nNow, some of that ’s reversing now. But we have definitely learned that we can do more\nwork from home in many, many different lines of work. Of course, that ’s not possible if your\njob involves being at a place, doing personal services. For many people, it ’s not possible. And\nthat’s very much something that skews to higher -income, higher -educated people being able to\nwork from home and others not so much. So I think we ’ve learned that.\nThe other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the S outh\nand the W est, the wave of cases this summer, I think , intuitively , having seen what happened in\nMarch and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity. And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and , and dealt with it. And , and it didn’ t actually —it had\na much smaller effect on ec onomic activity than we expected.\nThen comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger —a very, very large wave as , as\nwas very much forecast. People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that. And even there, if\nyou look at —I would say, look at the December jobs report. So , big job losses in, you know, in\nthat part of the service sector. So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants . There’s\nanother 100,000 in similar kinds of activities. But if you go —if you look elsewhere, it ’s not\nhaving an effect. You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly —really directly —exposed to the pandemic in their\neconomic activity, t hey’re doing okay. T hey are.\nHousing is a great example. You know, the way—the way —the way the housing\nindustry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in- person contact . They managed\n\nto pretty much immediately go to a more virtual —you know, with all the technology. They were\nable to completely a void that. And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding\nthat it’ s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person.\nSo there ’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’ t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting\nvenues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars . You just —you know, those are just going to —and\nthat’s—again , that’s millions and millions of people. And so you’ re just going to have to defeat\nthe pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we , we have a plan to do that, but we haven’ t\ndone it yet .\nAnd we need to—we need to finish the job. And we —it’ s, it’s within our power to do\nthat as a country this year. And I would just urge that —and I know people are working hard on\nthat. But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is , is getting the pandemic under\ncontrol, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks , and all that. That ’s the\nsingle most important economic growth policy that we can have. Thank you."
