My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheat ed\nstate and remains solid. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent as of September. We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nToday, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint\nby lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We continue to be confident that ,\nwith an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor\nmarket can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I ’ll have more to say about monetary\npolicy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nGDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier\nin the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months. This figure would have been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nin October. Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,\nbusinesses, and communities who have been harm —harmed by these devastating storms.\nThe unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over\nthe past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of\nindicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years. Total PCE prices rose\n2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Longer -term inflation\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we ’re attentive to the risks to\nboth sides of our mandate. At today’s meeting , the Committee decided to lower the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent. This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time.\nWe know that reducing policy strain —restraint too quickly could hinder progress on\ninflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nactivity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are not on any preset course. We will co ntinue to make our decisions\nmeeting by meeting.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation is\nnot sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipate d, we can move more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and\nuncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual m andate.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well a nchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our affect —actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we\ndo is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our discussion.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Given the expectation that the election outcome will\nproduce policies that would meaningfully impact the U .S. economy next year, how is the\nCommittee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the\nnext one in December ? And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive\nthe Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next A dministration?\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no\neffects on our policy decisions. As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and\nanyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to forecast , looking out past the very near term. Here , we don’ t know what the timing and\nsubstance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don’ t know what the effects on the\neconomy would be —specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the\nachievement of our goal variables : maximum employment and price stability. We don ’t—we\ndon’t guess, we don’ t speculate, and we don’ t assume. Now, just in principle, it ’s possible that\nany A dministration ’s policies or , or policies put in place by Congress could have economic\neffects over time —over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual- mandate goals. So ,\nwe—along with countless other factors, forecast s of those economic effects would be included in\nour models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal. Roughly\none year ago when the 10- year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30 -year mortgage rates\nwere near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs , if they were sustained , could weigh\non economic activity. Given that you’ ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now\ndialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U .S. Treasury yields today\nany different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above your target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would just say this . We’ve watched the , the run-up in bond\nrates, and it ’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago. I guess th at, you know, the long-\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nrun rates are well below that level. So we ’re watching tha t. Things have been moving around,\nand we ’ll see where they settle. I think it ’s too early to really say where they settle.\nUltimately , I’m sure we’ ve all read these decompositions of what, you know —and I\ncertainly have, but it ’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition. I will say,\nthough, that it appears that the moves are not , not principally about higher inflation expectations .\nThey’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way\nof downside risks. So that ’s what they’ re about.\nYou know, we do take financial conditions into account. If they —if they’re persistent\nand if they’ re material, then we’ ll certainly take them into account in our policy. But I would say\nwe’re not at —we’re not at that stage right now . It’s just something that we ’re watching. And ,\nagain, these things don’ t really have mainly to do with , with Fed policy, but to do with other\nfactors in the economy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up —is the September SEP —are those rate\nprojections still valid ? Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know what ? It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between\nthe last set and the next set. I , I wouldn’ t want to comment one way or the other. You know,\npeople are —let ’s talk about the data we ’ve gotten since the last meeting.\nSo, in the main , the economic activity data have been stronger than expected. The NIPA\nrevision was stronger. Certainly , the September employment report was stronger ; the October\nreport , not stronger ; retail sales, stronger. So , overall, though, I think you take away a sense of ,\nof some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished , with the\nNIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall , feeling , feeling good about economic activity. So I\nthink we would factor that in.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nAt the same time, we got one inflation report , which was —it wasn ’t terrible, but it was —\nit was a little higher than expected. So I think, really , the question is, is December . And, you\nknow, by December we ’ll have —we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,\ntwo more inflation reports, and lots of other data , and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we\nget to December.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions, Chair Powell. When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically\nas you try to make that decision? And then, as of the Fed ’s economic projections in September ,\nyou, you had written down fo ur quarter -point interest rate cuts in 2025 . Do you still think that\nthose are likely? Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted? And if it\nshifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of , of detail as to why?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I can’ t. We don ’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,\nand I can ’t characterize one that wasn ’t filled out today. So I can ’t really speak for kind of\nexactly where the—where the Committee is. I would just say, for December , we’re going to\nbe—again, in every meeting—we ’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that\naffects the outlook.\nAs you know, we ’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at\n5.33 percent . After today ’s move , we’re down 75 basis points. And we ’re, we’re asking\nourselves, “ Is that where we need to be?” You know that we ’re, we’re trying to steer between\nthe risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too\nslowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much. We ’re trying to , to be on a middle\npath where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\non inflation. We think that ’s where we are, but that ’s the question we ’re going to be asking in\nSeptember and, and in other meetings. And , again, I can ’t really update you on the C ommittee ’s\nthinking, because we don’ t fill out an SEP at this meeting.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Yes, total—totally appreciate that. I guess when it comes to your\nown thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a\nreasonable outlook?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I ’m going to wait —we’re going to wait and see how things\ncome in in December. I mean, I —it’s just —I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more\nneutral stance. And , and that ’s very much what we ’re on. That has not changed at all since\nSeptember. And, you know, we ’re just going to have to see where the —where the data lead us.\nWe have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.\nObviously, I ’m not ruling it out or in, but , but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say\nthat, you know, again, we didn’ t update the SEP, so I ’m not going to characterize, you know,\nwhere the C ommittee would be.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wondered if you\ncould please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement here in the first paragraph when you say, “ Inflation has made progress, ” dropping the word\n“further progress, ” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had\n“gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal. Is there\nany policy substance behind either of those changes in l anguage? Is it— is it meant to open the\ndoor to a December pause? Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core inflation in the last three months?\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Not really, no. So let me tell you what we were thinking. So the test\nof gaining further confidence was a —was our test for the first rate cut, right? And so we , we met\nthat test in September, and therefore we take that test out. If you leave it in, then it ’s new\nforward guidance. It ’s brand new forward guidance. “ What do you mean by it? Are you—are\nyou making —are you requiring yet further guidance? ” We have to say “yes” or “no” at every\nmeeting whether we ’ve made further progress.\nThe point is we have gained confidence that , that we’re on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent. So that , I would tell you, is , is what that ’s really all about. And it ’s not meant to send\na signal. Neither of those is meant to send a further signal. And , you know, saying “ further\nprogress ” it becomes a test where we don ’t want to be —we don’ t think it’ s a good time to be\ndoing a lot of , of forward guidance.\nYou know, we ’re—there ’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that —in what I ’ve said . The\npath that we ’re on, we do know what —where the destination is, but we don’ t know the right\npace, and we don’ t know exactly where the destination is . So the —the —the point is to find that,\nto find the right pace and the right destination as we go. And I think there ’s a fair amount of\nuncertainty about that , and , you know, you don’ t want to tie yourself up with , with guidance .\nYou want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Li esman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher\nrates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth. You didn’ t talk about it in terms of\nexpectations of higher deficits. Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in\ninterest rates, and is that —are rising deficits a concern to you?\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’t comment on fiscal policy , and, again, I don’ t have a lot\nmore to say on, on what ’s driving bond yields. In terms of , of policy changes, though, let me\ngive you a sense of how this , this works in the ordinary case. Let’s say Congress is considering a\nrewrite of the tax laws ; it doesn’ t matter what ’s in the content. So we would follow that. At a\ncertain point , we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we ’d start to model it. And then we ’d wait ,\nand we ’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “ This\nis—these are the likely effects. ” There ’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy\nchanges on various parts of the economy. So we ’d, we’d try to get smart on that. And then the\nlaw actually passes, and, you know, you’ d start to put it—you ’d probably run an alternative\nsimulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it . Then, then when it\nactually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.\nSo, you know, these —we have a very large economy. Many things are affecting it at any\ngiven time. And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but —it would go in,\nbut it would —you know, it ’s a process that takes some time. Clearly , the legislative process\ntakes a lot of time. And , of course, the real question is not the effect of that law . It’s all of the\npolicy changes that are happening. What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the\neconomy at a ny given time ? So I th ink that ’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that\nwe go through all the time with every A dministration , constantly. And I just —this will be no\ndifferent. But , you know, right now , we’re—there ’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right\nnow. I t’s such an early stage. We don ’t know what the policies are, and once we know what\nthey are, we won’ t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ ll be implemented or, or all\nthose sorts of things. So I think I would just say —\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mm -hmm.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. —w e’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be\nvery much regular order when we do do that.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just follow up on Nick’ s question—a re the current rates\nsomething you feel like you need to lean against , in that they go against the direction of policy\nby being—adding restriction to the economy? Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a\nsignal that you should do less?\nCHAIR POWELL. I —look, I just think—the first question is , how long will they be\nsustained? If you remember the 5 percent 10- year, people were drawing massively important\nconclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower.\nSo, you know, it ’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that\nreally matter. And we don’ t know that about these. What we’ ve seen so far ? You know, we ’re\nwatching it . We’re reading . You know, we ’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but\nright now it ’s not a major factor in , in how we ’re thinking about things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You\nmentioned the positive economic data that we ’ve seen since the September meeting, including\nthe revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth. We saw a stock market jump yesterday.\nThat’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this —with this\nbackdrop?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right . As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest\neconomic data have been strong, and that ’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome. But , of\ncourse, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with\ntoday’ s cut, policy is still restrictive. We understand it ’s not possible to say precisely how\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nrestrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive. And if you look at our goal variables, the labor\nmarket has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially\nin balance. It is continuing to cool, albeit at a —at a modest rate, and we don’ t need further\ncooling, we don’ t think, to achieve our inflation mandate. So that ’s the labor market.\nInflation has moved down a great deal from its higher —its highs of two years ago, and\nwe judge d, as I mentioned, that it’ s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. So the job’ s not\ndone on inflation. But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’ s decision\nis really another step in that process. Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an\nappropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Great. And just to follow up, could you— what might\ncause you to pause rate cuts in December ? What kind of economic data would lead you to that\npath? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’ t, you know, made any decision like that at all. But\nwe’re—so we ’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down —our stance down over\ntime to a more neutral level. And , as a general matter, as we move ahead , we are prepared to\nadjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves. So, for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we ’d be prepared to move more\nquickly. Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we ’re dialing back restriction.\nAgain, haven’ t made any decisions about that, but that ’s certainly a possibility. If you —\nyou can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT. So\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nwe reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.\nAnd so, you know, it —we ’re thinking about it that way, but it ’s, it’s something that we ’re just\nbeginning to think about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell. So with , with this noise in the jobs\nreports that we ’ve seen and you look at the Fed ’s favorite inflation, PC E inflation, overall it’ s\n2.1 percent —very close to the Fed ’s target —but core inflation is 2. 7 percent , and it ’s been that\nway since July. So why doesn’ t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so I think if you look at the 3 - and 6-month—you ’re quoting\nthe 12- month.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we look at all of them, right ?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. B ut if you look at three - and six -month core PCE, you’ ll see they ’re\naround 2.3 percent . So we look at all of them. And we look at —we also —we look at 12 as well.\nBut what it ’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress. And we expect there to\nbe bumps. For example, you know , the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings\nwere very, very low —probably unsustainably low. So that ’s why you see —that ’s why forecast s\ngenerally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year. On the other ha nd, the January\nreading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year. So\nwhen that falls out of the 12 -month calculation in February, we should see it staying down. So\nthere will literally be a bump up and then down. We understand that.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nOverall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,\n“What ’s—what is the inflation story now? Where is it coming from? ” So I point to a couple of\nthings. One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—\nof the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained\n2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years. So they’ re back at that level. What ’s not is housing services.\nSo let ’s talk about housing services. Housing services is higher. What ’s going on there\nis, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation. And what ’s\nhappening is older , you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to\nwhere market , market leases are—market rent leases are. So that ’s just a catch -up problem. It’s\nnot really reflecting current inflationary pressures ; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures. So\nthat’s, that’s one thing.\nThe other thing is , I’d say look at the labor market —not a source of inflationary\npressures. Where is it coming from? It’ s not a very tight economy. What is the story about\ninflation? You see that catch -up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas. So you’ re\nseeing —we ’re not , not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent\nwith inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2 percent. That story is intact, and it won ’t be one or two really good data\nmonths , or bad data months aren ’t going to really change the pattern at this point , now that we ’re\nthis fa r into the process.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So you’ re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you\nsee, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing in the economic data suggests that the C ommittee has any\nneed to be in a hurry to get there. We are seeing strong economic activity . We are seeing\nongoing strength in the labor market; we ’re watching that carefully , but we do see maintaining\nstrength there. And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is\ncarefully, patiently. Again, that ’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we —to the\nextent —to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of\nthat as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell . Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Two questions\ntoday. D id you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election\nresults? First question. Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and\nI do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum -employment side of the\nmandate, Chair Powell.\nSo the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months. One of the\nbroadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago. Compensation gains are sliding back. The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading\ndown to that bad neighborhood of the 20- teens . So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole\nsaying any “ further cooling ” is unwelcome. It is cooling, generally, a little bit further. So at\nwhat point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So on your first question, I ’m not going to talk about anything\nthat relates directly or indirectly to the election. On the second one, you’ re—you know, this is\nthe great question, and it ’s the one we think about all the time. So I ’ll just say a couple things.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nYou know, there ’s nothing really surprising here. What we know is that the\nunemployment rate is low. We also know that it ’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up\nsignificantly from a year or so ago. So we ’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.\nSometimes that has meant bad things. So far, it doesn’ t appear to be . It appears that the —I\nwouldn’ t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’ s continuing to very\ngradually cool, but it seem s to be in a good place. And our policy, of course, is designed to keep\nit in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further\nprogress on inf lation.\nYou know, you mentioned a bunch of , of indicators, and you ’re right . You know, the , the\nopenings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level. I would—I would characterize it more broadly as “normalizing .” You mentioned wages. Wages are still running just a bit above where\nthey would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to\nremain at this high level. If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainabl y at\nthese high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains . So I would say—in fact, you can\nsay it the other way, that , that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given\ncurrent productivity readings.\nBut, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high\nreadings, you should assume they ’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer -term trend. That\nhas always been the case for 50 years. But , you know, it may be that —we ’re now five years . If\nyou look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we ’re five years into , into a nice set\nof productivity readings , which are sustained and very healthy. But , overall, it ’s a good labor\nmarket. We could talk about 20 differ ent data series. We ’ll be looking at all of them, of course.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nBut, you know, we don’ t want the labor market to , to soften much from here. We don ’t think we\nneed that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Some of the P resident -elect’s\nadvis ers have suggested that you should resign. If he asked you to leave, would you go?\nCHAIR POWELL. No.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Can you follow up on is —do you think that legally that you’ re not\nrequired to leave?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. MICHELLE SMITH. Mike .\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. You talk\na lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data. But in terms of\nforward -looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials\naround the country? What did you hear today from the regional B ank presidents about what\ncompanies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than looking backwards? And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you think the appropriate policy path should be?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of\ndiscussions we had , and, of course , you ’ll see them in the minute s in three weeks. But I would\nsay this . I think, you know, the comments from our R eserve Bank colleagues and from the\nCEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now —pretty constructive,\nfeeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it ’s no longer\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthat much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking\nabout. So they feel like the labor market’ s in balance.\nPeople feel good about where the economy is. Demand is obviously pretty strong. And,\nyou know, you’ re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated . Maybe the\nyear is 2½. This is —this is —you know, this is a strong economy. It ’s actually remarkable how\nwell the U .S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor\nmarket, inflation coming down. We’ re, you know, really performing better than any of our\nglobal peers. And I think that is reflected in what you hear from —what I hear people hear from\nCEOs. I don’ t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from\nthose. And , of course, I hear the Reserve B ank presidents do a lot of that, and it ’s pretty\nconstructive overall. Now, that ’s not to say —there are areas of caution and things like that but ,\nultimately, overall pretty positive.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on\nthe horizon that you identified as something you ’re watching, what would they be?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it ’s—you know, it ’s things like —clearly , geopolitical risks\naround the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ ve had relatively little effect on the U .S.\neconomy. Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about\nthose as, you know, something that ’s on the horizon all the time. But , you know, ultimately, if\nyou look at the U .S. economy, its , its performance has been very good. And that ’s, that’s what\nwe hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue. If anything, people feel next\nyear—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Hi. It’s Andrew Ackerman with t he Washington Pos t. I just\nwanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy . Your predecessors Greenspan and\nVolcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial —\neconomic or financial stability. Will you do that, too? And , right now , we’re in a period of full\nemployment . We have large budget deficits and debt at historic , historic highs that are —and\nrising. Is that something you’ d speak out against?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the\npredecessors you mentioned have said. And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal —federal\ngovernment ’s fiscal path —fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. The level of our debt\nrelative to the economy is not unsustainable. The path is unsustainable. And we see that. And,\nyou know, you’ ve got a very large deficit at—you ’re at full employment, and that ’s expected to\ncontinue. So it ’s important that we —you know, that that be dealt with . It is ultimately a threat\nto the economy. Now, I can say that . I don’ t have oversight . We don’ t have oversight over\nfiscal policy. I ’ve said it on many occasions —just said it again.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay . Thank you. I guess the only other question is —to\nfollow up on Victoria ’s question —do you believe the P resident has the power to fire or demote\nyou, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other\nGovernors with leadership positions?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not permitted under the law.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Not what?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not permitted under the law. ANDREW ACKERMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chair Powell. Courtenay Brown from Axios. In response\nto Howard ’s question, you said it wasn’ t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the\neconomic uncertainties. Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not\nit includes some of the proposals that the President -elect has put out on the campaign trail —\ntariffs, for instance?\nCHAIR POWELL. No . I was not referring to , to the new A dministration ’s policies at\nall, nor will I today. So I —what I ’m just saying is , as we look ahead, we know —and I\nmentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided. I guess I should start by saying\nthat we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place , a very\ngood place. And—but as you look forward, you say, “ What are the risks? ” And one risk is that\nwe would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes\nback , and we —and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent. So we have to avoid\nthat risk. And that , that —to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully. The other\nrisk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do\nunnecessary damage to the labor market and to people ’s working lives. That, that says , “Don’t\nget behind the curve.”\nSo these are two —these two things are the two risks that we have to manage. And so\nwe’re, we’re in the middle there. We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the —manage\nboth of those. Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,\nenable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal. A nd so there ’s—you know, there —\nthis is the thing : Meeting by meeting , we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right\npath is.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nYou know, it ’s not as important —the precise timing of these things is not as important as\nthe overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of\nneutral, a more neutral policy. We don ’t know exactly where that is ; we only know it by its\nworks. We’ re pretty sure it ’s below where we are now. But as we move further, there will be\nmore uncertainty about where that is . And we ’re going to move carefully as , as this goes on so\nthat, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell . Simon Rabinovitch with t he\nEconomist . I know you don’ t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look\nat the breakevens, it , it is clear that longer- term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at\nabout 2.5 percent , for example, on the five -year. That’s up half a point from when you cut in\nSeptember. Do you have any concern at all that longer -term inflation expectations are\ndeanchoring or , put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . So we , we would be concerned if we saw —if we thought we saw\nlonger -term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level. That ’s not what we ’re seeing.\nWe’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with —you know, I , I\nlooked at the five -year, five-year earlier today , and it ’s probably moved, but it ’s just not —it’s\njust—it’s kind of right where it ’s been, and also it ’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE\ninflation. So that ’s one that ’s been a traditio nal one that we look at a lot. But, overall,\nexpectations seem to be —and really have throughout this—in a place that ’s consistent with\n2 percent inflation. But you’ re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow\ninflation expectations to drift upward. But that ’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in\n2022 was , was to avoid that.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Hi, Chair Powell. Kelly O ’Grady, CBS News. We just talked\nabout what you’ ve heard from business leaders on the economy , but many average Americans\nare still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets. So what ’s your message to them\non when they might expect relief?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right that, you know, we say that the economy is\nperforming well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,\nfor example. And we went through —the world went through a global inflation shock, and\ninflation went up everywhere. And , you know, it , it stays with you because the price level\ndoesn’ t come back down. So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people\nto feel better. And that ’s what we ’re—that’s what we’re trying to create. And I think we ’re well\non the road to creating that.\nInflation has come way down. T he economy is still strong here . Wages are moving up\nbut, but at a sustainable level. So it ’s just —I think —I think what needs to happen is happening\nand, for the most part, has happened. But it’ ll be some time before people, you know, regain\ntheir confidence and feel that. And , you know, we don’ t tell people how to—how to feel about\nthe economy. W e respect —completely respect —what they ’re feeling. Those feelings are true ;\nthey’ re accurate. We don ’t question them . We—you know, we respect them.\nKELLY O’GRADY. And just a quick follow -up—President -elect Trump has been\ncritical of your performance. Any concern about his influence on the Fed ’s independence?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not going— I’m not going to get into the —any of the political\nthings here today, but thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so\nwe don’ t have to deal with it. So that ’s our —that is actually our plan. [Laughter] You know,\nit’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you ’re—you know, you’ re—anything you do with\ninterest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the —or the\nemployment mandate.\nI would just say that, you know, we ’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a\nwhole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in\nunemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation. So knock on wood, we ’ve\ngotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market. And we believe we can\ncomplete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is\nexactly what we’ re trying to do.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I —no. I wouldn’ t rule anything out or in that far away. But that ’s\ncertainly not , not our plan. I mean, our baseline expectation is that we ’ll continue to move\ngradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and that the labor market will remain strong. If you look at our —look at our —that will not change\nfrom the September S EP. You know, t hat is our baseline forecast . And, short of some\nexogenous event, it will —that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future. So —\nbut, ultimately, you know, it ’s—we ’re not in a —we’re not in a world where we can afford to\nrule, rule things out a full ye ar in advance. It’s—there ’s just too much uncertainty in what we\ndo.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Jean for the last question.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. I wanted to go\nback to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the\ncumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path to 2 percent. Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal under the average inflation- targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?\nCHAIR POWELL. No . That’s, that’s not the way our framework works. We’ re aiming\nfor inflation at, at 2 percent. We’ re—we do not have —we do not think it would be appropriate\nto deliberately undershoot. And , you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be\na problem, too, in a way. But that ’s not part of our framework, and it ’s not something we ’re\ngoing to be —going to be looking at in our framework review.\nThank you very much."
