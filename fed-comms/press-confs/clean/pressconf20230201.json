My colleagues and I understand the\nhardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back\ndown to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten th e\nstance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all .\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate b y 25 basis point s. We continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary\npolicy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time . In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price\nstability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to\nsay about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic develop ments.\nThe U.S. economy slow ed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below -trend\npace of 1 percent. R ecent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this\nquarter . Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace , in part reflecting tighter\nfinancial conditions over the past year . Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken,\nlargely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixe d investment .\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate at a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\n\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month\nover the last three months . Although t he pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past\nyear and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be\nout of balance. Labor demand substantially exceed s the supply of available workers , and the\nlabor force participation rate ha s change d little from a year ago .\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent. The inflation data received over the past three\nmonths show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And, while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path.\nDespite elevat ed inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s\nwell as measures from financial market s. But that’s not grounds for complacency. Alth ough\ninflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched .\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our m andate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power , especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\nAt today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n25 basis point s, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4 ¾ percent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interes t rates by 4 ½ percentage points over the past\nyear. W e continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds\nrate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently\nrestrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\nWe are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest -sensitive\nsectors of the economy, particularly housi ng. It will take time, however, for the full effects of\nmonetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of\nmonetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation ,\nthe Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step- down\nfrom last year’s rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the\nCommittee to assess the economy ’s progress toward our goals as we de termine the extent of\nfuture increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue\nto make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and\ntheir implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\nWe have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better\nalignment with supply . Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to\nour 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored . Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\n\nemployment and st able prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly\nagainst prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course, until the job is done .\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you,\nand I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris .\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber, t he Associated Press. T hank you for\ndoing this. As you know , financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields\nfalling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in\nJanuary. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder? And could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial\nconditions?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect\nthe policy restraint that we ’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent . And ,\nof course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short -term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial\nconditions. And it is our judgment that we ’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance,\nwhich is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things affect financial conditions —not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial\nconditions along with many other factors as we se t policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel\nfrom the Washington Post . Over the last quarter, we ’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages,\nand a fall in consumer spending, all wh ile the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a\nhistoric low. Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would\nneed to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you ’re looking for?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have\nseen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that\ndisinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage. What you see is,\nreally , in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been\nfixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated. So you see that . In\nthe other —in the housing services sector , we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while\nbut then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be\nlower. So, in those two sectors, you’ ve got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector\ncalled nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’ t see dis inflation yet. But I\nwould say that , so far , what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market\nconditions.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Has your —I’m sorry.\nCHAIR POWELL. Go ahead.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go\nchange d since December?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. We’ re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting,\nand we ’ll see at that time. I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now\n\ngetting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data. So —but, you know, we ’ll\nupdate those forecasts in March.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. You and some of your\ncolleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would\nlet some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December JOLTS this morning . Job openings are actually rising. That also coinci ded with\nslowdown in wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right about the data, of course . What we did see—w e’ve\nseen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job\nopenings number has —in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently. Yeah, I did see that it moved\nup—back up this morning. I do think that it ’s probably an important indicator. The ratio, I\nguess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we —you’ re right, we do see wages moving down. If you\nlook across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level . So many, many—by many, many indicator s, the job\nmarket is still very strong.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby, and then Howard. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times . Given the\neconomic data since the December meeting , is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most\n\nrecen t SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward? Or does ongoing now mean more\nthan two rate rises now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our\nbest estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that ’s obviously back in\nDecember. And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent. At the March meeting,\nwe’re going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however,\ncontinue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent . We think we ’ve covered a\nlot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened. I would say we still think\nthere ’s work to do there. We haven ’t made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think, you\nknow, we ’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March\nmeeting and then t he May meeting. I don’ t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It\ncould certainly be higher than we ’re writing down right now. If we come to the view that we\nneed to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December , we would\ncertainly do that. At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction , then we ’ll, you\nknow, we ’ll make data -dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.\nCOLBY SMITH. Just as a quick follow -up, how are you viewing the kind of bal ance of\nrisk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level?\nCHAIR POWELL. I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it ’s very\ndifficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’ t get the job done . Inflation springs back , and we have to go back in. And\nnow, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a\n\nvery difficult risk to manage, whereas I —of course, we have no incentive and no desire to\novertighten. But we , you know, if we feel like we ’ve gone too far, we can certainly —and\ninflation is coming down faster than we expect , then we have tools that would work on that. So I\ndo think that , in this situation , where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know,\nthe job is not fully done. As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents\n56 percent of the core inflation index where we don ’t see dis inflation yet. So we don’ t see it.\nIt’s not happening yet. Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 pe rcent on a\n6- and 12- month basis. So there ’s not —nothing happening there. In the other two sectors\nrepresenting, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is\ncredible, that’ s coming together, although you don’ t actually see dis inflation yet in housing\nservices, but it ’s in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don’ t see anything here. So I\nthink it would be premature —it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that\nwe’ve really got this. We n eed to see —our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how\ndo we get that done? There are many , many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they\nshould be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.\nBut, so far, we don’ t see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work\nleft to do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual. So\nI just wanted to connect a couple of dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You ’re saying inflation has eased T hat’s new.\nYou’ve ta ken out references to the war in Ukraine that ’s causing price increases. You ’ve taken\nout references to the pandemic. You ’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were\n\nbeing driven higher, yet that ’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still\nhave ongoing increases to come. So I ’m wondering, why is that the case? And does it have\nmore to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a\nvery overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the\nfirst time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it , really , in\ngoods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. We—t his is what we thought would happen\nsince the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, a nd for the reasons we thought .\nWe—you know, it ’s supply chains, it ’s shortages, and it ’s demand revolving back towards\nservices. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that’ s, you know, around a quarter of\nthe PCE price index—core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services , and that ’s\ndriven by very different things. And we —as I mentioned , with housing services, we expect , and\nother forecasters expect , that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but\nwill then come down , assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be\nsoft. And we do assume that. So we think that that’ s sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see\ndisinflation in the goods sector , and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little\nless than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this\nis good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core\ngoods ex. housing—sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about. We don’ t see\nit yet. It ’s—you know, it ’s seven or eight different kinds of se rvices, not all of them are the\nsame. And, you know, we have a sense of what ’s going on in each of those different\nsubsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research\nwould show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be\n\nimportant. Some of the other ones it ’s—the labor market is not going to be important. Many\nother factors will drive it. In any case, we don’ t see dis inflation in that sector yet. And I think\nwe need to see that it ’s the majority of the core PCE index , which is the thing that we think is the\nbest predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with ] our mandate.\nSo it’s not tha t we’re not —we ’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic . We’re just telling you that\nwe don’ t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we\ndon’t see it yet. Until we do, I think we —you know, we see ourselves, we ’ve got to be honest\nwith ourselves , but w e see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent —we’ll see more\npersistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we ’re just going to\nhave to—w e have to complete the job. Y ou know, that ’s what we’ re here for.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, you observed\nseveral years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above -target\ninflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high\nlevel despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did\nover the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here a nd\nsee what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’ve—you know, we ’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points , and\nwe’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately\nrestrictiv e. And why do we think that ’s probably necessary? We think, because inflation is still\nrunning very hot . We’ re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we ’re\nthinking about that. It really —the story we ’re telling about inflation is to ourselves , and the way\nwe understand it is basically the three things that I’ ve just gone through a couple of times. And ,\n\nagain, we don’ t see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet. But , I mean , I think our\nassessment is that we’ re not very f ar from that level. We don ’t know that, though. We don’ t\nknow that. So I think we ’re—you know, we ’re living in a world of significant uncertainty. I\nwould look across the rate —the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by —\nyou know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is\nrestrictive. We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That ’s\nall. And we ’re going to —you know, that ’s why we ’re slowing down to 25 basis points. We’ re\ngoing to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this\nmeeting this week?\nCHAIR POWELL. We—you know, you’ ll see that the minutes will come out in three\nweeks, and we ’ll give you a lot of detail. I —you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the\npath ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn’ t want to start to drive the —describe all\nthe details there, but that was the sense of the discussion , was really talking quite a bit about the\npath forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given\nthat w e’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U .S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do\nwhatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its\nown analysis of any legal constraints?\nCHAIR POWELL. So your question is, would we —say your question again.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Will the Fed do what T reasury directs as it relates to making\npayments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re really asking about —you’ re asking about prioritization, in\neffect, is what —\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Yes. Y es.\nCHAIR POWELL. O kay. So I feel like I have to say this. There ’s only one way\nforward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States\ngovernme nt can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be\nhighly risky and that no one should assume that the F ed can protect the economy from the\nconsequences of failing to act in a timely manner.\nIn terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent . And I’m just\ngoing to leave it at that.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the\nevent that that would happen?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m just going to leave it at that. This is a matter that’ s to be\nresolved between, really —it’s really Congress ’ job to raise the debt ceiling . And I gather there\nare discussions happening, but they don’ t involve us. We’ re not involved in those discussions.\nSo we ’re the fiscal agent.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Jeanna and then Steve .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases\nand then restarting them? Lorie Logan from th e \n\nsuggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that view is broadly\nshared on the C ommittee.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the C ommittee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.\nWe judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive\nmonetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent . So that ’s the judgment that we\nmade. You know, we ’re going to write down new forecasts in March, a nd we ’ll—you know,\nwe’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry , I should have been clear er. I mean, would it be possible to\ntake a meeting off, for example, and then resume? You know, could you, rather th an just doing\nat every meeting that move , go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, I think this is not something that the C ommittee is thinking\nabout or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle, though, you know, we used to —the thing\nwe used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember , 25 basis points, and that was\nconsidered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the\nBank of Canada did and, you know, they le ft it that they ’re willing to raise rates after pausing.\nBut this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the S EP has the P CE\ninflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent . Meanwhile, the three- month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent ,\nand you’ ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have\n\npenciled in for this year. And you’ ve also achieved it witho ut the 1 percentage point increase in\nthe unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I ’m wondering if you’ ve\nconsidered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong,\nand it ’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge\nin unemployment.\nAnd, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair\nLael Brainard, who said, “ To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part\nfor important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors .” In\nother words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Than ks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if—you’ re right—i f you\ntake very short -term three -month, say, measures of PCE —core PCE inflation, they ’re quite low\nright now. But that ’s because that ’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from\ngoods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer -run trend of\nsomething around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go\nback up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example. So that ’s really where the\nsustainable level is. It’s more like at 4 percent . So that would suggest there ’s work left to do.\nYou know, let ’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.\nAs I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent. We would take that into\naccount.\nIn terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services , as I mentioned earlier, it ’s a\nvery diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that—\n\nsubsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the\nlabor market in a way, but som e of the other sectors are not. And, for example, you know,\nfinancial services is a big sector that ’s really not driven by labor markets —wages. So that ’s why\nI said there are a number of things that will affect—t ake restaurants, right? So, clearly, labor is\nimportant for restaurants but so are food prices. And, you know, transportation services is going\nto be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you ’re not going to have, you\nknow, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the\nlabor market. And I don’ t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your\nquestion. I do thi nk there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can\nsoften. And so far , we’ve got —as I mentioned, in goods , we have inflation moving down\nwithout the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment\nwill probably rise a bit from here. But I still think —I continue to think that there ’s a path to\ngetting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a\nsignificant increase in unemployment. And that ’s because the—you know, the setting we ’re in is\nquite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior —\nyou know, in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the\nreasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough. But I think there is —\nthere’s ongoing disinflation , and we don’ t yet see weakening in the labor market. So we ’ll have\nto see.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can we get there with 5 percent ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Certainly possible. Yeah . Absolutely it ’s possible. You know, it ’s a\nquestion—no one really knows. I think it ’s because this is not like the other business cycles in\nso many ways. It may well be that as —yeah, as —that it will take more slowing than we\nexpect —than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent . But I don’ t—that’s not my base case.\nMy bas e case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant\ndownturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that ’s a possible outcome. I think\nmany, many forecasters would say it ’s not the most likely outcome . But I would say there ’s a\nchance of it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. I ’d like to pick\nup on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of\nyour tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there ’s still a lot of talk\nabout very, very slow growth going forward in 2023. And the recession indicators are all\nsuggesting that we are going to see rec ession this year. So I ’m wondering if you’ ve changed\nyour view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is\ngoing forward and whether you’ re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which\ncalls for more restraint on your part.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think you—most forecast s and, you know, my own\nassessment would be that that growth will continue —positive growth will continue but at a\nsubdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of —GDP growth of 1 per cent last year and also\n sales growth, which we think is a better indicator , of about 1 percent . I think, you know,\nmost forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other fa ctors, though, that need to be considered. You will\n\nhave seen that the global picture is improving a bit , and that will matter for us, potentially. The\nlabor market remains very, very strong, and that ’s job creation , that’s wages. As inflation does\ncome down, sentiment will improve. You also—state and local governments are really flush\nthese days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending\nchecks. So I think that ’s going to support —they’re also spending a lot. Ther e’s a lot of spending\ncoming in the construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that ’s going to support\neconomic activity. So I think there ’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive\ngrowth this year. And that ’s my base case , is that there will be positive growth this year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. O kay, Rich.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg. First off, how are you\ndoing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Fine . Thanks. Fine.\nRICH MILLER. Good. Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said\nyou need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you’ re thinking of? You mentioned three months —that we ’ve seen three months in\na row. Governor Wal ler suggested he might want to see six months. And so is it just the\ninflation data , or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have\nthat “ substantially more evidence ” metric ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’ t think there ’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped\nor anything like that. I think it ’s just an accumulating —accumulation of evidence. So, of\ncourse, we ’ll be looking —by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment\nreports, two more CPI reports, and we ’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will. A nd we ’ll\nbe asking ourselves, what are they telling us? And soon after that, we ’ll have another ECI wage\n\nreport, which, as you know , is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it ’s\nvery complete. And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some —was\nconstructive. It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level. They ’re\nstill at a level that’ s way above —well above where they were before the pandemic. So I don’ t\nwant to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it ’s\ngoing to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy\nover time. But I will say, though, we —you know, it is our job to restore price stability and\nachieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. We ’re not —market\nparticipants have a very different job. It’s a fine job . It’s a great job. In fact, I did that job for\nyears but in one form or another. But, you know, we have to deliver that. And so we are\nstrongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking\nthe questions. So you’ ve talked about we had solid job growth. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness, by the way. We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer\nspending. It seems so far it ’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to —from a\n9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation. Is the hard part yet to come to go from\n6.5 to 2?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t think we know, honestly. You know, the —so we, of course,\nexpected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’ t come down all\nthrough ’ 22. And now it ’s coming down, and it ’s come down pretty fast. So I would say these\nare—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a\n\nglobal pandemic and we shut the economy down a nd Congress did what it did and we did what\nwe did. It’ s just —it’s unique. So I think certainty is ju st not appropriate here. Inflation —it’s\njust harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster . It may take longer to come down.\nAnd, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target , and we will do that. But I think\nwe’re going to be caut ious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think\nthat the game is won because, you know, it ’s—we ’ve got a long way to go. It’ s just —it’s the\nearly stages of disinflation. And it ’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in\ndisinflation, but that ’s great. But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that\nit’s going to take some time . That’s all.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Do you —how long do you see the n, the federal funds rate\nremaining at this elevated level?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so—a gain, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you\nwill see from the S EP and —I mean, there are many different forecasts, but , generally, it ’s a\nforecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down\nsteadily but not quickly. And , in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those\nexpectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of course, other people have forecasts with i nflation coming down much faster, that ’s a different\nthing. You know, if that happens —inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we ’ll be\nseeing that , and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with t he\nEconomist . May I ask a further question about the language around “ ongoing increases ?” T hat,\nof course, implies at least two further rate rises . If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the\n\nimplication is that you ’ll raise rates one more time and then pause. Are you concerned about that\ndivergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is\nlargely due to the market ’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. I think\nthat’s the bigger part of that. So, again, as I just mentioned, we —you know, our forecasts —\ndifferent participants have differe nt forecasts, but , generally, those forecasts are for continued\nsubdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession. And we\nhave inflation moving down, you know, into th e—somewhere in the mid -threes or maybe lower\nthan that this year. We ’ll update that in March, but that ’s what we thought in December.\nMarkets are past that. They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.\nSo we ’ll just have to see. And we have a different view and —a different view, it ’s a different\nforecast, really. And given our outlook, I just —I don’ t see us cutting rates this year if we get —if\nour outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now. If we do see inflation coming down much more\nquickly, that ’ll play into our policy s etting , of course.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsle y from NPR. One of the changes in\nthe statement this month is that the C ommittee is no longer listing public health as among the\ndata points you’ ll conside r in assessing conditions. What should we make of that? Does the\nFederal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s the general sense of it. Look, we understand —I personally\nunderstand well that COVID is still out there, but that it ’s no longer playing an important role in\nour economy. And, you know, we ’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think\nwe just —we knew we would take it out at some point. There ’s never a perfect time , but we\n\nthought that—you know, people are handling it better , and the economy and the society are\nhandling it better now. It doesn’ t really need to be in a —you know, in the F ed’s monthly, you\nknow, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health\nissue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently. She said she doesn ’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I ’m wondering if you agree\nwith that.\nCHAIR POWELL. I do. Yeah, I do. You don’ t see that yet. But the whole point is, you\nknow, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that , effectively, in\npeople ’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens —\nthat’s what we can ’t allow to happen. And, you know, so that ’s why we worry that the longer\nwe’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know,\nthe more risk of something like that. But no, there ’s not much—i t’s more of a risk. It always\nhas been more of a risk than anything else. By the way, I think it ’s becoming less salient. And\npeople are —you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I ’ve seen some data, too, that\nshow people are, you know, gradually—they’ re glad that inflation is coming down. People\nreally don’ t like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to\neconomic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’ re very, very low with\n3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once infla tion is seen to be\ncoming down in coming months , even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. So that ’s what you’ re looking at most closely, is\nconsumer expectations?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know,\nare the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of\nthe process of creating inflation. That ’s a sort of bedrock belief . In one way or another , it has to\nbe. We think it’ s important. And , in this case, I would say , the risk eight months ago or so,\nlonger -term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year.\nExpectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer\nend. So it ’s, you know —and that ’s—I think that ’s very reassuring. I think, you know, the\nmarkets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to\n2 percent and it’ s just a matter of us following through . That's immeasurably helpful to the\nprocess of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will\ncome down, that ’ll be part of the process of getting it down. And it ’s a very positive thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the\nminutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important , when the C ommittee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of\nfinancial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I\nhaven’ t seen —heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering,\nhas that concern eased among members, or is that still something you ’re concerned about?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would put it this way. It ’s something that we monitor carefully.\nFinancial conditions didn ’t really change much from the December meeting to now. They\n\nmostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It’s important\nthat the markets do reflect the tightening that we ’re putting in place. As we ’ve discussed a\ncouple times here, there ’s a difference in perspective b y some market measures on how fast\ninflation will come down. We’ re just going to have to see. I mean, I ’m not going to try to\npersuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and\nsome patience and that we’ ll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we ’ll see.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brendan, for the last question. BRENDAN PEDERSEN. Hi, Chair Powell. Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.\nI wanted to ask if the F ed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when i t comes to quantitative\ntightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster to that drop- dead debt ceiling deadline . Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop -dead\ndeadline this summer?\nCHAIR P OWELL. Look, I —it’s very hard to think about all the different possible\nramifications. And I think the answer is, basically, I don’ t think there ’s likely to be any\nimportant interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting , and—as\nit will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’ t risk, you know, the\nprogress we ’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that\nthat will happen. I believe it will happen. You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as —you know, as the process moves on. For example, the T reasury G eneral\nAccount will shrink down, and then it will grow back up. And we understand there ’ll be lots of\nflows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that. We’re\nwatching it carefully. We’ll just be monitoring it.\nThank you very much."
