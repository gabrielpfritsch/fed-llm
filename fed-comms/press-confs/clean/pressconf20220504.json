  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time\nin a couple years.\nBefore I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak\ndirectly to the American people.\nInflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re\nmoving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve\nthat it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained perio d of\nstrong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment\nand price stability , the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate\nby ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal\nfunds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are beginning the process of signif icantly\nreducing the size of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy\nactions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nAfter expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged\ndown in the f irst quarter. Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely\nreflected swings in inventories and net exports —two volatile categories whose movements last\nquarter likely carry little signal for future growth. Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly.\n\nThe labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first t hree\nmonths of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs. In March , the unemployment\nrate hit a p ost-pandemic, and near -five-decade, low of 3.6 percent . Improvements in labor\nmarket conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage\ndistribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued.\nEmployers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in\nmany years.\nInflation remains well above our longer -run goal of 2 percent . Over the 12 months\nending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent . Aggregate d emand is strong, and bottlenecks and\nsupply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. Disruptions to supply have\nbeen larger , and longer lasting , than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader\nrange of goods and services . The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resul ted\nfrom Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID- related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions\nas well.\nRussia ’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts\nand sympathies are with the people of Ukraine. Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain. In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creat ing spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels.\n\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for t he American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that\nhigh inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability.\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been\nadapting, and it will continue to do so. At today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target\nrange for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “ anticipates that ongoing\nincreases in the target range will be appropriate.” We also decided to begin the process of\nreducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.\nAssuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, t here is a\nbroad sense on the Committee that additional 50- basis -point increases should be on the table at\nthe next couple of meetings. We will make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from\nincoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal .\nWith regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our\nsecurities holdings. Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a pr edictable manner by allowing\nthe principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet , up to monthly\ncap amounts. For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and\n\nwill then increase to $60 billio n per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under\nthis monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills. For agency mortgage -backed securities, the cap\nwill be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month. At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount. Our balance sheet decis ions are guided by our maximum -\nemployment and price -stability goals . And, in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of\nthe details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertai n environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the\nupside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid\nadding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks . The Committee is determined to take the measures necessa ry\nto restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timira os, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the\nunemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years a nd at the bottom end of FOMC participants ’\n\nprojections for the longer -run rate that you submitted in the projection s at the last meeting. How\nhas your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What\ndoes this imply for your inflation forecast? And how has your level of confidence changed with\nregard to the feas ibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . Thank you. So you’ re right —3.6 percent unemployment is just\nabout as low as it ’s been in 50 years. And I would say that I expect , and Committee members\ngenerall y expect , that we ’ll get some additional participation. So people will be coming back\ninto the labor force. We ’ve seen that particularly among prime -age people. And that will, of\ncourse , tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. I would also expect , though, that job\ncreation will slow. Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months —very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy. And so we think—\nwith fiscal policy less supportive , with mone tary policy less supportive , we think that job\ncreation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.\nImplications for inflation —really , the wages matter a fair amount for companies,\nparticularly in the service sector. Wages are running high, the highest they’ ve run in quite some\ntime. And they are one good example, or good illus tration , really , of how tight the labor market\nreally is , the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that ’s\nbecause of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through\nour policies —through fur ther healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example , of vacancy\nfilling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we ’d like to think that supply and\ndemand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still\n\nhigh levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation. That ’s\nour expectation. Your third question was?\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing\nthe economy into a downtur n.\nCHAIR POWELL . So I guess I would say it this way: There’ s a path. There’ s a path by\nwhich we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have\nvacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level. The re’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million\nvacancies, 6 million unemployed people. So we haven ’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort\nof the vacancy /unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve. We haven ’t been at that sort of level of\na ratio in the modern era. So , in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could\nsee vacancies come down a nd, as a result —and they could come down fairly signif icantly a nd, I\nthink, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are. And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there ’s a\npath to that.\nNow, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or\noutcome, if you will. And I ’ll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is , households and\nbusinesses are in very st rong financial shape. You ’re looking at, you know, excess savings on\nbalance sheets —excess in the sense that they ’re substantially larger than the prior trend.\nBusinesses are in good financial shape. The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.\nAnd so it doesn’ t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. T herefore, the economy is strong\nand is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. So, but I ’ll say , I do expect that this\n\nwill be very challenging; it’s not going to be easy. And it may well depend, of course , on events\nthat are not under our control. But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome , and\nthat’s what we ’re going to do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman. You talked about using 50- basis -point rate hikes or the possibility of them in\ncoming meetings. Might there be something larger than 50? Is 75 or a percentage point\npossible? And perhaps you could wa lk us through your calibration. Why one month should—or\none meeting should we expect a 50? Why something bigger? Why something smaller? What is\nthe reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure. So a 75- basis -point increase is not something the C ommittee is\nactively considering. What we are doing is , we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.\nAnd we ’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that\nare co nsistent with our expectations, there ’s a broad sense on the C ommittee that additional 50-\nbasis -point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we ’re going to\nmake those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we ’ll be paying close attention to the\nincoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions. And , finally, of\ncourse, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they\nevolve.\nSo the test is really just as I laid it o ut—economic and financial conditions evolving\nbroadly in line with expectations. And, you know, I think expectations are that we ’ll start to see\ninflation, you know, flattening out —and not necessarily declining yet , but we ’ll see more\nevidence. We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak\n\nor flattening out. We’ ll want to know more than just some evidence. We ’ll want to really feel\nlike we ’re making some progress there. And we ’re going to make these decisions, and t here’ ll\nbe a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It’s a\nvery difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just\nso many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So, you know, we ’re\nleaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision a s we get there.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment\nrate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the\nfunds rate?\nCHAIR POWELL . I don ’t think the one month is —no. N o. One month’s reading\ndoesn’ t tell us much. You know, we ‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a\ndirection that gives us more comfort. As I said, we ’ve got two months now where core inflation\nis a little lower, but we ’re not looking at tha t as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I\nthink we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—t hat inflation, in fact, is under\ncontrol and starting to come down. But , again, it ’s not like we would stop. We would just go\nback to 25- basis -point increases. It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. But , again,\nour expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 -basis -point increases\non the table at the next two meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let ’s go to Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH . Thank you. Colby Smith from the Financial Times. Given the\nexpectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed ’s target at year -end, what constitutes a\nneutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate? And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So—neutral. When we talk about the neutral rate, we ’re really\ntalking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down. So it ’s a\nconcept , really. It’s not something we can identify with any precision. So we estimate it within\nbroad bands of uncertainty. And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3\npercent . And also, that ’s a longer -run estimate. That’s an estimate for an economy that ’s at full\nemployment and 2 percent inflation. So , really , what we ’re doing is , we’re raising rates\nexpeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral. But we know that there’ s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there. So we ’re going to be\nlooking at financial conditions, right ? Our policy affects financial conditions , and financial\nconditions affect the economy. So we ’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on\nfinancial conditions. Are they tightening appropriately? And then we ’re going to be looking at\nthe eff ects on the economy. And we ’re going to be making a judgment about whether we ’ve\ndone enough to get us on a path to restore price stability. It ’s that. So if that path happens to\ninvolve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those\nlevels. We won ’t.\nBut, again, there ’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers\ndon’t really feel. You know, you’ re going to raise rates, and you ’re going to be kind of inquiring\nhow that is affecting th e economy through financial conditions. And , of course, if higher rates\nare required , then we won ’t hesitate to deliver them.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks , Chair Powell . Neil Irwin with Axios . Do you see evidence that\ninflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers ’ wage demands, businesses ’\n\nwillingness to raise prices? Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on\ninflation? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . We don ’t really see strong evidence of that yet , but that does not in\nany way make us comfortable. I think if you look at short -term inflation expectations, they ’re\nquite elevated. And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’ s because people expect inflation to\ncome down.” And , in fact, i nflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.\nLonger -term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only\nto levels where they were in 2014, by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think that’s a fair description of the picture. But it’ s really about the risks. We don ’t see a wage–price\nspiral. We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they ’re doing that, but there\nhave been price shocks. So I just think it takes you back to the basic point —was that we know\nwe need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal , neutral levels. And\nwe need to look around and keep going if we don ’t see that financial conditions have tightened\nadequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we ’re not where we need to\nbe. So , again, you don’ t see those things yet , but I would say there ’s no basis for feeling\ncomfortable about that. It’s a risk that we simply can ’t run. We can ’t allow a wage–pric e spiral\nto happen. And we can ’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It ’s just something\nthat we can ’t allow to happen, a nd so we ’ll look at it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna .\nJEANNA SMI ALEK . Great. Thanks, Chair Powell . Jeanna Smia lek with the New York\nTimes. You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.\nObviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side. And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them —I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those .\n\nCHAIR POWELL . Well. So our tools don’ t really work on supply shocks. Our tools\nwork on demand. And to the extent we can ’t affect , really , oil prices or other commodity prices\nor food prices and things like that, so we can ’t affect those. But there ’s a job to do on demand.\nAnd that —you can see that in the labor market , where demand is substantially in excess of\nsupply of workers. And you can see it in the product markets as well. But I guess I ’m just\npointing out that —a couple of things. For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in\nChina, they’ re likely to , both, add to headline inflation. And people are going to be suffering\nfrom that, you know. People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but —even\nthough they don’ t actually tell us much about the future path. So the second thing is that they’ re\nboth capable of preventing further progress in supply chains heal ing or even making supply\nchains temporarily worse. So they’ re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain\nhealing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too. So , in a way , they’re two further negative\nshocks that have hit really in the la st, you know, 60 days, 90 days.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a from Politico . I want to follow up on that,\nbecause you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play\nin inflation. And I ’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of\nRussia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out , does getting back\ndown to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain i ssues get resolved, since you can\nonly handle the demand side, as you said? Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don’ t resolve themselves , in order to try and get inflation back\ndown to where you want it to be?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So, you know, I ’ll just say : For now, we ’re focused on doing the job\nwe need to do on demand, and there ’s plenty to be done there. Again, if you look at it, it’ s\nessentially almost two to one , job vacancies to unemployed people. There’ s a lot of excess\ndemand. The re’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size\nof the labor force. So there ’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on. A very\ndifficult situation —you know, you would look at core infla tion, which wouldn’ t include the\ncommodity price shocks. And, you know, that ’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on\nthat, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation. I\nmean, we have to be sure that in flation expectations remain anchored. And I mean, that ’s part of\nour job, too, so we ’d be watching that carefully. And it puts any central bank in a very difficult\nsituation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD S CHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters . And thanks, and nice to be\nback. So two questions. One quick one. You ’ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure s o often now, I ’ve got\nto ask you, what would be a good figure there? What would you like to see that come down to to think that you’ re in sort of a noninflationary vacancy- to-unemployed rate? And, secondly, on\nhelp from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels? Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year —how are you\nmapping that into household consumption? Have they come down enough? Do you need\nanother leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending?\nCHAIR POWELL . Okay, so in terms of the vacanc ies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’ t\nhave a goal in mind. There’ s no specific number that we ’re saying , “W e’ve got to get to that.”\n\nIt’s really , you’ ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.\nAnd that depends not only on the level of those things —it also , it depends on how well the\nmatching functions in the labor markets are working. Because, you know, the longer t hese\nexpansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out.\nAnd that also tends to, you know, to help. So there isn ’t a specific number. I will say we were —\nyou know, I think, I think when we got to one -to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we\nthought that was a pretty good number. But , again, we’ re not shooting for any particular\nnumber. What we’ d like to see is progress, but we ’re not really looking at that. That ’s an\nintermediate variable. We ’re looking at wages , and we’ re looking at , ultimately , inflation. So,\nyou know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as,\nyou know, interest -sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values\nbroadly. And , you know, the re’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are\nrelated to that. You know, we don’ t focus on any one market —the equity market or the housing\nmarket —we focus on financial conditions broadly. So we wouldn’ t be targeting any one market ,\nas you suggest , for going up or down or taking a view on whether it ’s at a good level or a bad\nlevel. We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions —all the different\nfinancial conditions inde xes, for example, which include equity. But they also include debt and\nother , many other things —credit spreads , things like that —too.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell . Rachel Siegel here from t he Washington Post.\nTo follow up fr om your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American\npeople about when they will start to feel the effects of , say, a 50- basis -point rate hike or multiple\n\nhikes? How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or t heir rent or their gas\nbill? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand. A nd some of us\nare old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren ’t. But it’ s very unpleasant.\nIt’s just something people don’ t—when they experience it for the first time, you’ re paying more\nfor the same thing. If you ’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’ t have that much\nextra to spend. And it ’s immediately hitting you r spending on groceries , on, you know, on\ngasoline, on energy, and things like that. So we understand the pain involved. So how do you\nget out of that? And it ’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant , high nature\ndoesn’ t get entrenched in the economy. That ’s what we ’re here for , one of the main things we ’re\nhere for —perhaps the most fundamental thing we ’re here for. And the way we do that is , we try\nto get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is\nunder less stress and inflation will go down. Now, the process of getting there involves higher\nrates —so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that. So it ’s not going to\nbe pleasant either. But in the end, everyone is bett er off. Everyone — particularly people on\nfixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices. And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices. We ’ll do it as quickly and\neffectively as we can. We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in\nunemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown. But , ultimately, we think about the\nmedium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done —the sooner ,\nthe better.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thank you, Chair Powell . Edward Lawrence with the Fox\nBusiness Network. So you’ ve talked in the past about consumer spending and how that drives\nthe economy. Are you concerned , with this high level of inflation , that the consumer will stop\nspending—and what ’s the level of your concern— pushing us into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL . So the economy is doing fairly well. W e expect growth to be solid\nthis year. And we see, y ou know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong—\nand even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So , and the labor\nmarket —if you look at the labor market , for people who are out of work and looking, there are\nlots of job opportunities for —wages are moving up and at rates that haven ’t been seen in quite a\nlong time. So it ’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a\nwage increase in your current job. So it ’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that\nit’s close to , or vulnerable to, a recession. Now, of course, given events around the world and\nfading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity.\nCertainly , it will not be —last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered\nfrom the pandemic . As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent. But most forecasters have\ngrowth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . But we ’ve talked with economists who have advised\nDemocrat s and R epublican P residents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on\ninflation that a recession is inevitable.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price\nstability without a recession —without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high,\nhigher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So I see a strong economy now. I\nsee a very strong labor market , for example. Businesses can ’t find t he people to hire —they can ’t\n\nfind them. So , typically , in a recession, you would have unemployment. Now you have surplus\ndemand. So there should be room , in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting\npeople out of work. The issue will come that we don ’t have precision surgical tools. We have,\nessentially , interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they ’re famously blunt\ntools. They ’re not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. No one thinks this will be\neasy, no one thinks it ’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do\nthink we ’ve got a good chance to do that. And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances —it\nis to try to achieve it. So that ’s what we ’re doing. There are a range of opinions, though, and\nthat’s only appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve Dorsey.\nSTEVE DORSEY . Thanks . Steve Dorsey, CBS. You mentioned earlier , just now,\nfading fiscal policy. Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from polici es at the\nWhite House and in Congress in combating inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, it ’s really the F ed that has responsibility for price\nstability. And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity , we take it as a\ngiven, and we don ’t evaluate it —it’ s not our job, really. We don ’t have an oversight function\nthere. And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening , to try to sustain\nmaximum employment and price stability. So if Congress or the A dministration has ways to\nhelp with inflation, I would encourage that, but I ’m not going to get into making\nrecommendations or anything like that. It ’s not , it’s really not our role —we need to stay in our\nlane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know,\ngive other people advice [laughter] . Right now , we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job.\nAnd I ’ll stick to that. Stick in our lane.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve Matthews.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS . Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News. A number of your\ncolleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to\nbring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And , two, you’ ve recently spoke n in great\npraise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the\n1980s. And while it ’s certainly not your desire —the soft landing is the big hope of everyone —\nwould this FOMC have the courage to endure recession s to bring inflation down if that were the\nonly way necessary?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I think it ’s certainly possible that we ’ll need to move policy to\nlevels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral. We can ’t know that today. That\ndecision is not in front of us today. If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won ’t\nhesitate to do it. I ’ll say again, the re’s no bright line, you know, that you’ re stepping over.\nYou’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it.\nYou’re looking at financial conditions and how that ’s affecting the economy and making a\njudgment. Yo u know, we won’ t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than\nthe other one. It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we ’re\nabsolutely prepared to do that. It —wouldn’ t hesitate if that’ s what i t takes .\nSo I am, of course —who isn ’t an admirer of Paul Volcker ? I shouldn’ t be singled out in\nthis respect. But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. And I —\nBut I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought wa s the right thing.\nThat’s what it was. It wasn ’t a particular thing. It was that he always did —he always did —what\nhe thought was the right thing. If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through. So that’s [what] the test is . It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?\n\nI would say, we do see , though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential\nfor the country in coming years. Without price stability , the economy doesn’ t work for anybody,\nreally. And so it ’s really essential , particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, like if\nyou look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.\nIn the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to pe ople in the\nlower quartiles. And it was, you know, racial , wealth , and income —not wealth, but income gaps\nwere coming down, wage gaps . So it ’s a really great thing. We’ d all love to get back to that\nplace. But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability. So , basically , we’ve\nbeen hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic. T his isn ’t anything like\nregular business. This is , we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know,\nin—since the Depress ion. Then we have this outsize d response from fiscal policy and monetary\npolicy. Then we have inflation . Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the\ncommodity, you know, patch in half. And now we have the se shutdowns in China. So it ’s been\na series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that ’s coming out the other side.\nAnd we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it ’s obviously going to be very\nchallenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with. So I guess that ’s how I think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris R ugab er.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER . Thank you. Chris Ru gaber, Associated Press. Earlier,\nyou just said that if necessary— I think were the words —that you would, or if it , if it turned out\nto be necessary, or you said that it’ s possible that we ’ll need to move polic y to restrictive levels.\nGiven where inflation is and the hot economy is —or, certainly , the hot labor market, as you\n\ndescribed it —why still the hesitation? I mean, what else do you need to see in order to\ndetermine that? Wouldn’ t the F ed naturally be lo oking to go to a restrictive level at this point?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWEL L. So I didn’ t—if I said “ necessary ,” I meant to say “ appropriate. ”\nWe’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this. It ’s more , if we think it’ s appropriate.\nYou know, the point is, we ’re a very long way from neutral now. We ’re moving there\nexpeditiously, a nd we ’ll continue to do so. And we can ’t make that decision , really , today. The\ndecision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neut ral. And,\nyou know, I expect we ’ll get there expeditiously, as I ’ve mentioned. So it ’s not that we don’ t\nwant to —making that decision today wouldn’ t really mean anything. But I ’ll say again, if we do\nbelieve that it’ s appropriate to go to those levels, we won ’t hesitate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Mike Mc Kee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. The balance\nsheet —why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not\nimmediately start in the middle of this month , say? And do you have another, a newer or a\nbetter , estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline? And then,\nfinally, I ’m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your\nremarks? Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, why June 1? It was just , pick a date, you know, and that\nhappened to be the date that we picked. It was —nothing magic about it. You know, it ’s not\ngoing to have any macroeconomic significance over time. We just picked that. Sometimes we\npublish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that ’s what we ’re doing. I wouldn’ t\nread anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stre ss how uncertain the effect\n\nis of shrinking the balance sheet. You know, we run these models —and everyone does in this\nfield—and make estimates of what will be , how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of\nbalance sheet shrinkage compared to quantit ative easing? And, you know, these are very\nuncertain. I really can ’t be any clearer. There won ’t be any clearer [estimates] . You know,\npeople estimate that , broadly, on the path we ’re on —and this will be taken, probably, too\nseriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace. But I\nwould just say, with very wide uncertainty bands —very wide. We don ’t really know . There are\nother estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way. And some of you may read about that. That ’s kind of a mainstream estimate. We know that it is part of returning to more normal ,\nmore neutral financial conditions. And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.\nIn terms of speaking to the American people , so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us ,\nreally , that that’ s who we work for, and that it ’s inflation that people are feeling all over the\ncountry. And it ’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are\nworking hard on fixing it. I thought it was quite important to do that. And so that was really the thinking behind that.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Do you think the F ed has a credibility problem?\nCHAIR POWELL . No, I don’ t. And a good example of why would be —in the fourth\nquarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year ,\nyou saw financial markets reacting , you know, very appropriately. Not to bless any particular\nday’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to\nour guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. I t’s—monetary policy is working\nthrough e xpectations now, to a very large extent. We’ ve only done two rate increases. But if\n\nyou look at financial conditions , the two -year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now. In September, I\nthink it was a t 20 basis points .\nAnd that ’s all through the economy. People are feeling th ose higher rates already. And\nso that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible. And I think we want\nto keep it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott Horsley. [No response] Okay. Brian Ch eung.\nBRIAN CH EUNG. H i there. Brian Ch eung with Yahoo Finance. To expand on Steve ’s\nquestion about Paul Volcker , there was also a great pain that came with that as well —higher\ninterest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses. I’m wondering how you kind of\nsquare what might be demand disruption. Are you already seeing that ? Is the idea here to\nincentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments ?\nIs that essentially what’ s happening thr ough this hiking cycle? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, so , as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is\nsubstantially in excess of supply. And what you’ re seeing as a result of that is prices going up\nand at unsustainable levels , levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation. And so what\nour tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates : it moves down. Interest rates,\nyou know —businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less. That ’s\nhow it works. But , ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in\nbalance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where\npeople can lead successful economic lives and not worry about infla tion. I mean, so, yes, there\nmay be some pain associated with getting back to that. But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg Robb.\n\nGREG ROBB . Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch . I\nwas wondering if you could take a step back and talk about , in March the dot plot had, you\nknow, looked like steady quarter -point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of\nthe year. Now—where it seems like you ’re much more aggressive. So could you talk about the\nthinking that ’s behind that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, look, I think what you’ ve seen is —really, I would say, in the\nmiddle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with\nwhat the data were saying. If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports. And inflation —month by month, inflation had com e down till September, a few months in a row ,\nstayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy. And by the way—then , with the restatement of\nthe jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second\nhalf of the year. But that hadn’ t happened yet. Anyway, we got an ECI reading—e mployment\ncompensation, [employment cost] index reading— the Friday before the November meeting.\nThen we got a really strong jobs report . Then we got a really high CPI report. And so I think it\nbecame clear to the C ommittee that we needed to adjust and adapt. And we have. Ever since\nthen, really ever since then , we’ve been adapting. We, you know —the C ommittee moved by the\ntime of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting. And that process is going\non. And it ’s clearly continuing. And that ’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the\nMarch meeting —that no one should look at any single S EP as sort of a real resting place for 90\ndays, because we ’re in a fast -evolving situation. And that ’s what ’s happened. You can see—\nunanimous vote today, of course . And I told you the guidance —that broad support on the\n\nCommittee to have 50- basis -point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings. So you’ re\nright. And by the way, other forecasters have bee n doing the same thing. And it ’s just us\nadapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZ ER. Hi. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I want to ask how you’ re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and\nmaximum employment —especially when the unemployment rate for B lack workers is still\nroughly double , roughly twice the rate for white workers.\nCHAIR POWELL . So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot\nand are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that ’s one thing I\nwould say. And that ’s important. But the bigger point is this : I do not , at this time, see the two\nsides of the mandate as in tension. I don ’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of\nbalance. You can see that there’ s a labor shortage. There aren ’t enough people to fill these job\nopenings. And companies can’ t hire , and wa ges are moving up at levels that would not , over\ntime, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And , of course, everyone loves to see\nwages go up. And it ’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level , because\nthese wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation. So , what that really means is, to get\nthe kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves\nall Americans, especially the people in the lower -income part o f the distribution, especially them.\nTo do that , you’ ve got to have price stability. A nd we ’ve got to get back to price stability so that\nwe can have a labor market where people’ s wages aren ’t being eaten up by inflation and where\nwe can have a long expa nsion, too. That ’s—the good things you can have, as we have. W e’ve\nhad—several of the longest expansions in U .S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that ’s\n\nbecause it ’s been a time of low inflation. And long expansions are good for people and good for\nthe labor market. So that ’s the way I think about it. I think we —you know, our tools work. We\nhave to think in the , in the medium and longer term. And I do think that the best thing for\neveryone is for us to get back to price stability to suppor t, really , a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions. Thanks very much."
