  "text": "September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIRMAN POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks f or being here. I am going\nto start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the ec onomy, what we decided today,\nand then a bit about our expecta tions for the months ahead.\nOur economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip. U nemployment is low, the\nnumber of people working is ri sing steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All\nof these are very good signs. Of co urse, that’s not to say tha t everything is perfect. The benefits\nof this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country’s economic\nchallenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep\nthe economy strong, healthy, and moving forward. That is the b est way we can promote an\nenvironment in which every American has the opportunity to succ eed.\nEach time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy\nto best support job growth and low , steady inflation? For many years, this question called for\nvery low interest rates to hel p an economy that had been damage d by the deep financial crisis\nthat gripped the world 10 years ago. As the economy has steadi ly gained strength, the Fed has\nbeen gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that a re normal in a healthy economy. We\ntook another step on that path toda y with a quarter-point incre ase in short-term interest rates.\nThese rates remain low, and my c olleagues and I believe that th is gradual return to normal is\nhelping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benef it of all Americans.\nAs I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of th e financial crisis—a\npainful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs , their homes, and, for some, their\nhopes and dreams. In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also\ntaken many steps to make the financial system safer. In partic ular, we’re holding the largest\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nbanks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liq uidity they hold and in the ways\nthey assess and manage the risks they take. I am confident tha t the system today is stronger and\nin a far better position to suppor t the financial needs of households and businesses through good\ntimes and bad. We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also\nensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.\nNow, let me go into more detail a bout the developments that mot ivated today’s policy\ndecision. Both household spending a nd business investment are expanding briskly, and the\noverall growth outlook remains favorable. And several factors support this assessment: Fiscal\npolicy is boosting the econom y, ongoing job gains are raising i ncomes and confidence, and\noverall financial conditions remain accommodative. These condi tions are consistent with our\nSummary of Economic Projections for this meeting. The median o f Committee participants’\nprojections for the growth of r eal GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.\nJob gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months , well above the pace\nneeded in the longer run to provi de jobs for new entrants to th e labor force. The unemployment\nrate stood at 3.9 percen t in August and has been near that leve l since April. Smoothing through\nmonth-to-month variations, the la bor force participation rate r emains about where it was in late\n2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on\nparticipation. We expect the job market to remain strong. And the median of Committee\nparticipants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower\nthan that in 2019.\nOverall consumer prices, as m easured by the price index for per sonal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July. The core\nprice index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and t ends to be a better indicator of\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nfuture inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period. The FOM C seeks, and expects to see,\ninflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis. At any given\ntime, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil\nprices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we ex pect this to be transitory, as is\nreflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation\nmeasures remain very close to 2 pe rcent across the whole projection horizon.\nToday the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage\npoint, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percen t. This action reflects th e strength we see in the economy and\nis one more step in the process that we began almost three year s ago of gradually returning\ninterest rates to more normal levels. Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest\nrate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June. The med ian of participants’ views on\nappropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June me eting.\nThese projections play an impor tant role in our work. My colle agues and I believe that\nit’s useful to communicate our v iews on likely prospects for th e economy and for policy. We are\nwell aware, however, that the ec onomy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully\nconstructed projections are high ly uncertain. The projections about the appropriate path of\npolicy assume that the economy evo lves broadly in line with the projections for growth,\nemployment, unemployment, and inflation. If the economy were i nstead to falter , lower interest\nrates would be appropriate. Conve rsely, if inflationary pressu res were to rise more than\nexpected, higher inte rest rates would be appropriate. Right no w, as our statement indicates, risks\nto the economic outlook a ppear roughly balanced.\nReaders of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee d ropped a sentence that\nindicated that “the stance of m onetary policy remains accommodative.” This change does not\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nsignal any change in the likely pa th of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line\nwith our expectations. We still expect, as our statement says, “further gradual increases in the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I\njust discussed. Thanks very much. I’m happy to take your ques tions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell,\ngiven the lags of monetary pol icy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening\ncycle? How will you know when to stop? And do you need to kee p going until something in the\neconomy breaks?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So the tight ening cycle, as you know, is a re flection of the\nstrength of the economy. And it’ s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising\nrates. And I think the fact tha t we have moved quite gradually , in a way, allows us to carefully\nwatch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial ma rkets to see how the economy is\nprocessing higher interest rat es. And the fact that we’re movi ng so gradually—I think it—I think\nit limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we’re being able to raise rates\nand then wait and see how the econo my absorbs these rate increa ses. And so far, the economy\nhas performed very well and very much in keeping with our expec tations.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times. President Trump has\nstated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes. His comments didn’t appear to have\nany impact on you or your colleagues. Were his comments discussed at your meeting? And do you have any concerns about the eff ect of these types of commen ts on the perception of the\nFed’s independence and your monetary policy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So we’ve been gi ven a really important job to do on behalf of\nthe American people by Congress , and we’ve been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nand I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission. We consider the best thinking, the\nbest theory, and the be st evidence. We have disparate points o f view, which we debate\nextensively and come to a perspe ctive and try to set monetary p olicy to achieve maximum\nemployment in a context of pri ce stability. That’s what we do. We don’t consider political\nfactors or things like that. A nd so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way\nit’s always going to be for us.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you\nexplain how—the stock market be ing at a near all-time high, cor porate spreads being very\ntight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisio ns to raise interest rates? Is there\na concern on your part? And then, as sort of a second and rela ted part, can you tell us what\nhappens in 2020 and 2021 that—I know you can’t tell us when you ’re shaking your head\n[laughter]—that prompts—that pr ompts you—the Fed to think that the rates need to still be\nabove neutral in that time period? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So in ter ms of financial markets and m onetary policy,\nwe—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the br oader economy, and they’re one\nof the many things that we tak e into account. T he part of it t hat we control, though, is what we\ndo with the federal funds rate a nd that has—that has effects ou t through, you know, out through\nthe full interest rate curve a nd into financial asset prices ge nerally. So the answer is, we take\neverything into account, but, you know, broader financial condi tions are just one of the things\nthat we take into account.\nIn terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your que stion was why the funds ra te needs to be above\nneutral? So you’re right. Some of—some of the participants have mostly very modest\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \novershoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple—thre e years out. You know, it’s far\nout into the future. I think it’ s hard to be confident that th at’s—that that’s t he way things are\ngoing to be. What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go throu gh time is asking at every\nmeeting whether monetary polic y is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that’s an\nassessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howar d Schneider with Reuters. Cha ir Powell, I\nthink—is this too good to be true? Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below\n4 percent—very low, substantiall y below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction\nof inflation there. And so I don’t think that’s ever happened since the 1960s. Why do you think\nit’s going to happen now? Or in the alternative, is this forec ast for unemployment just being\ndriven by your confidence interva ls to the extent that, well, w e don’t know what else to do, so\njust extend the lie out—line out until something happens?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. No, you’re right . The Committee forecasts wh at they—what\nthey show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s\nthroughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains ver y close to 2 percent. That is what\nthe forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack—\nthat is to say, a flat Phillips curve. And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that’s not just our forecast, that ’s many forecasts. So that is—that is\n—that is the forecast. So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural\nrate of unemployment mean? And s o that really is a longer-run concept that we think the\neconomy will return to over the longer run. But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t— it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nNow let’s just admit that the i nflation process has changed dra matically from where it\nwas in the 1960s to where it is now. It’s in a good place now. We can’t take for granted that it\nwill remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course , watching carefu lly. If inflation\nreacts more strongly or more weak ly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy\nappropriately.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I coul d follow up on that, what are you buying with interest\nrates?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, interes t rates, of course, have effects on growth, have\neffects—I mean if—I guess the —your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest\nrates? The question is, what would the economy look like if yo u didn’t raise ra tes? It would\nlook very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates.\nWe’re always trying to, you know, w ork our way between the—sort of the two—the two\nproblems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery\nunnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent targe t. Or if we move too slowly, we have\nan economy that can overheat. So w e’re—that—that’s happened th rough history. We don’t see\nany signs of that now, but we’re a lways trying to navigate betw een those two shoals. And we\nthink that gradually, you know, rai sing interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those\nrisks seriously.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. The Fed\nhas recently been saying that fin ancial stability risks are mod erate. What kind of developments\ncould prompt a change in that asse ssment to elevated risks? And is there an argument for\nmoving the countercyclical capita l buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting\nuntil the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be too late? Thanks.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial\ncrisis is really the importan ce of the stability of the financi al system. And so we—since the\nfinancial crisis, as you’re aw are, we’ve had a major focus on b uilding up our monitoring of\nfinancial conditions and financial stability issues. We’ve als o put in place many, many\ninitiatives to strengthen the f inancial system through higher c apital and better re gulation, more\ntransparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that,\nwhich are meant to strengthen the financial system. We’ve done many of those things, and we\nfeel that the financial system is in a much better place.\nAs we look at—as we look at conditions most recently—and this was at our last meeting,\nand it was in our minutes for the last meeting—quarterly, we ha ve a briefing at the FOMC, and\nalso at the Board, of the staffs’ views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall\nvulnerabilities to be moderate . If you dig into the different aspects of that que stion, households\nor balance sheets are in good sha pe. You know, employment is h igh, wages are rising, that sort\nof thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, is—you know, muc h higher capital, much higher\nliquidity—is much stronger. I f you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the\nupper range of their historical —upper reach of their historical ranges. And then if you look at\nnonfinancial corporates, you get—th ere is the story of leverage there. So it’s not that there aren’t\nany vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate.\nNow, you ask about the countercyc lical capital buffer. The cou ntercyclical capital buffer\nis a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016. We said that we would\ndeploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal. We revisit that on a regular\nschedule, and the last time we r evisited it was, I think, last year—sometime last year—and\nconcluded that the test was not met. As I mentioned at the las t briefing, the—you know, the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nassessment was that vulnerabili ties were moderate, but it remains a kit—a tool for our toolkit that\nwe can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate.\nSAM FLEMING. Has the chance of needing to deploy it increased?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as\nrelatively moderate. I think the f inancial system—I think another thing that we learned in the\ncrisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabil ities as a long expansion continues. I\ndon’t see that in troubling—troubl ing amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s\nappropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.\nMARTY CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsi nger, Associated Press. The researchers at the\nEuropean Central Bank this wee k put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the\nU.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 perce nt in the first year after a\nwidespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you’ve had—your policy statement,\ndoes it mention the trade ten sions? You did not mention them. What do you—what kind of\noutlook do you have right now for the trade war?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So I gue ss I need to start by saying t hat we’re not\nresponsible for trade polic y, and we don’t comment on particula r, you know, trade actions and\nthat sort of thing. But you will ha ve seen that we have this v ery extensive network of business\ncontacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising\nchorus of concerns from businesse s all over the country about d isruption of supply chains,\nmaterials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we’ve been hearing\nquite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk ab out it in the meeting, and it goes\nin the minutes. So we, you know, tha t’s—we’re very transparent about hearing a ll that. I think\nif you look at the aggregate perfor m—the performance of the U.S . economy at an aggregate—at\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \na national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point. And—or you can look at it the\nother way: You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been a nnounced are applied, what would be\nthe effect at the aggregate le vel? And they’re still relativel y small.\nYou know, we worry about a couple of things. One is loss of business confidence, which\ncould reduce investment. Agai n, we don’t really see effects th at we could measure yet. Also,\nthe possibility of a financial market reaction over time to une xpected trade developments. More\nthan anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know. If the—\nif the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good , you know. Trade generally\nsupports productivity, supports higher incomes. And, you know, fair trade—fair trade under\ninternationally accepted rules can be a good thing. I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a\nplace where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time—a more\nprotectionist world—that’s goi ng to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American\nworkers, and families, and also for other economies.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. This is the third time\nthis year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts. I’m w ondering if you could share a little\nbit about what’s causing that rise and whether you see supply-s ide effects coming through from\nthe fiscal policy—fiscal stimulus yet. Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So it’s true. This year has—we’ve kept raisi ng our forecast for\nthis year. This—as the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing. And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and\nthere’s good reason to expect that to continue. You ask why. You know, some of it is, no doubt,\nthe effect of the fiscal policy c hanges, the tax cuts, and the spending increases—that’s got to be\npart of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \noil patch. But, you know, the growt h picture is very much supported by very high readings of\nhousehold confidence, business c onfidence, so it’s a—it’s a—it’ s a—it’s a pretty particularly\nbright moment, I think. If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for\nthe U.S. economy.\nHEATHER LONG. And the supply-side effects?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, supply- side effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they’re\nhuge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and\nparticularly—and allow faster expensing for investment. The id ea is to encourage more\ninvestment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So t he effects are very uncertain, they’re—you know, they’re—the\nliterature is—it’s—there’s no cl ear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how\neffective they are. And it w ould be soon to be seeing supply-s ide effects. The other—supply-\nside effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re proba bly slower to come in. But, you\nknow, as I said, we—I certainly hop e—I hope that we’ll be marki ng up our estimates of potential\ngrowth as well.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Taking a page from your risk-\nmanagement approach in Jackson H ole, Mr. Chairman, I’m wonderin g if you can talk about what\nrisks would make the Committee —plausible risks—go faster in 201 9. What risks would make\nthem go slower? If you could talk about scenarios. And then I’d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, poss ibly cutting rates to soft-land the\neconomy? I know the forecast doesn ’t show that, but I’m curiou s how you soft-land without\ndoing that.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so I thi nk I mentioned in the opening r emarks maybe\nsomething that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower. You\nknow, the main thing where we mi ght need to move along a little bit quicker would be if\ninflation—inflation s urprises to the upsid e. We don’t see that. We really don’t see that. It’s not\nin our forecast, but any—so I woul d—I regard that as a risk. I think either a significant—\nsignificant—correction and lasting correction in financial mark ets or a slowing down in the\neconomy that’s inconsistent wit h our forecast—those are the kin ds of things we’d react to.\nIn terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going\nto be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on th e ground. So if the economy is\nweakening, then it’s very possible we’d be—we’d be cutting rate s and, you know, vice versa.\nAnd so I can’t rule that out. I t—I think it’s quite difficult, though, to know what the effects—\nwhat the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be i n 2020. It’s difficult to know what\nthe policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that f ar out. So we have to make estimates,\nbut we know that they’re highly uncertain.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawre nce from Fox Business. Thank you , Chairman.\nThe unemployment rate is now at 3.9 percent. The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the\npast 12 months. Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady. The amount of job\nvacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this\nyear—where is the point at whic h, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment\nand the Federal Reserve should r eexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not\nto cool an expanding economy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation—\nunemployment is too low? Y eah. Yeah. You know, so we’ve been —I think the perform—labor\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nforce participation has surpri sed us on the upside. There is a long-run trend there, and we’ve\nnow had basically five flat years. If you look—if you look at labor force participation, since the\nfourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a\nsideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other\nfactors. That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really—\nthat’s really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force\nand looking for jobs, finding jobs . So that’s a great thing.\nAnd, by the way, it’s a signal. It’ s one of the things that ha s allowed the unemployment\nrate not to fall further. And it’ s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply\nside, that there may be more labo r supply than th e prior trend would indicate. So it’s a very\npositive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don’t know how long\nit can continue. We have models, and we look at this—we look a t this question all the time.\nAnd, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the\nidea that that may continue or not.\nDONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair. Donna Bor ak with CNN. Just to follow up on the tariff\nquestion, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven’t quite\nmaterialized—those weren’t your w ords verbat[im]—but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General\nMotors, Macy’s have all said that they expect the tariffs to af fect the prices of everyday\nconsumer goods. So my question is, when—should there be an eff ect—when would you expect\nto see that? And at what point do you start to become worried that it’s actual ly going to affect\nconsumer spending and dampening economic growth?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s a concern. It’s a risk. You know, so y ou could see prices\nmoving up. You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail p rices moving up. The tariffs\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nmight provide a basis for companie s to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant\nto and unable to raise prices, whe re raising prices is really d ifficult, you know, with the ability to\nshop on the internet. This coul d provide, you know, a way for— again, we don’t see it in the\nnumbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s h ard to say how one would react.\nAnd the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflati on is, is it just a\none-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And\nthat’s a real—that’s an importa nt question in, in how we would think about the appropriate\nresponse.\nDONNA BORAK. But is there a sens e of timing, in terms of when you might see that\nkick in, the effect of?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Don’t see it yet. You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re\nhearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tarif fs. You’re hearing—we’re\nhearing a lot of talk of labor s hortages, of material costs in particular industries. We’re hearing a\nlot, you know, what amount to supply -side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing\nit. We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of\nit moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet. And, you know , we just aren’t, and we’re\nwatching very carefully.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.\nFinancial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measu res that track that. The flow of\nfunds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in T reasuries. So I’m wondering if\nthat suggests a change in the wa y that tightening affects the e conomy. And along those lines,\nyou mentioned that you dropped the word “accommodative” doesn’t suggest a change in policy.\nBut if you’re dropping forward guidance in terms of “accommodat ive,” does the do t plot really\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nserve any purpose anymore if , as you say, you can’t be confident out to 2021 what’s going to\nhappen with the economy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. A couple questions in there. So the dot plot —I mean, I—it’s\nnot new. I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out\nare fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC particip ants who are writing down their\nindividual views on the evolu tion of the economy and of appropr iate monetary policy. We don’t\nvote on that. These are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that\ninteresting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose.\nI think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over. You know, we\nput that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance\nthat we weren’t trying to slo w down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were\nstill going to be pushing to suppor t economic activity. Well, that—you know, that purpose has\nbeen well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anyth ing that’s important to the way\nthe Committee is thinking about policy going forward. That’s w hy that came out. Did I get—\ndid I get all of your ques—?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. The idea that f inancial conditions remain loose even though you\nraised rates 200 basis points?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad f inancial\nconditions index, that’s pretty m uch the answer you’ll get. We don’t control that, and, as I\nmentioned earlier, we do take fi nancial conditions into account in what we do. And financial\nconditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account.\nBut if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest r ates—look at long-term interest\nrates this year and short-term int erest rates this year, there’ s very significant increases. And, you\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nknow, with your long and variable lag s, that should be—that sho uld be having an effect over\ntime.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, V ictoria Guida with Politico. So Nellie L iang was just put\nforward by President Donald Trum p to the Fed Board, and I was j ust curious, you know, given\nthat she’s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could spe ak to what role you played in, you\nknow, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate. And\nthen also, if I—if I may follo w up on the financial stability d iscussion from earlier, you know,\nyou’ve mentioned before that corpor ate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you\nknow, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on le veraged lending by making that\nguidance less of a—less of a cudgel, I guess, while—at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely,\ncompletely under the control of the White House and, ultimately , the President. And\ntraditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I ’m happy to say that that has\ncontinued. But these are—these are really decisions for the Wh ite House, and, you know, we\nare—think of us as just being c onsulted. I will say that I’m v ery happy and excited about the\nteam that we’re putting together , and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up\nand down our hall filled. It’s b een pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying\nsomething on the Board hall. S o we’re looking forward to getti ng some people confirmed.\nIn terms of corporate debt, so t his is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long\ntime in areas that were very clo se to the leveraged lending markets. So, you know, I have had a\nlot of experience in that. That m arket has evolved really sign ificantly since before the crisis.\nAnd, you know, the banks take much l ess risk than they used to. They’re—the—they’re\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nessentially in the business of distributing these loans and bon ds rather than keeping them on their\nbalance sheet, to a much greater degree. But it’s also true—an d there’s significant research on\nthis—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending market s does have channels for\naffecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kin d of thing in those markets, so we\nmonitor that carefully. You know , the guidance is —isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the\nleveraged lending isn’t binding, a nd that’s just—that’s just th e way that the law is interpreted.\nSo it’s something we’re monito ring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are\nmoderate.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. If I could come\nback to “accommodative,” do you think of policy as accommodativ e at present? How close are\nyou to neutrality, and do you share t he view of some of your co lleagues that you’ll eventually\nneed to be restrictive?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so are we accommodative now? So I thin k if you look at\nthe—look at the dot plot in the S EP, you’ll see that the federa l funds rate, even after today’s\nmove, is below the longer-run neu tral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a—\nan estimate of that. So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you\nknow, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that\nmeans an accommodative policy. So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative. It is still\naccommodative. The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s mor e that the language has run its\nuseful life.\nThere’s another point, th ough, too, which is, you know, we don’ t want to suggest either\nthat we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative ” stops or suggest that that’s a\nreally important point in our thinking. You know, what we’re g oing to be doing, assuming we\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nstay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring i ncoming data from the financial\nmarkets and from the economy a nd asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals\nwe want to achieve—you know, sustai n the economy, maximum emplo yment, stable prices.\nThat’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of a mount to thinking less about one’s\nprecise point estimate of the ne utral rate. So that’s how I think about that.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The second question was, do you think you’ re going to end\nup in a restrictive posture? Gove rnor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you\nwill need to do that. Do you agree with that?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s possible. It’s very possible. It happens often. And, as I\nmentioned, many of the participan ts have written that down, and they’ve written down really\nmodest overshoots, you know, amoun ting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a\nbig effect on the economy.\nYou know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on w hat happens. It\ndepends on if we keep going—you can t hink of it different ways. Maybe we’ve underestimated\nthe neutral rate. Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the n eutral rate and we’ ll just go to that,\nor maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or tw o rate increases beyond it. I\nthink it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering. The\nquestion we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support—\nnot too much, not too little—to susta in the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairma n. Greg Robb from MarketWatc h. The 10-year\nanniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month. I\nwas wondering if you thought there w ere any lessons from the cr isis that you want to share—and\ntwo points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress. Now, Secretary\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nPaulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Cong ress made a mistake when it\ntook away the Fed’s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then o ne other thing is that, are you\nconfident that all these nonbanks didn’t—you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know,\nthe FSOC, you know, system. So are you confident that the—you can see the risks in the\nfinancial system? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing\nI think that we learned was th e—as I mentioned, I think, earlie r, the importance of maintaining\nthe stability of the financial system. So I think if you look— if you look back at the way the\nmodels worked and the way people thought about risk in the econ omy, that’s what was missing,\nand I think it’s not missing anymore. So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that.\nWe raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest\nbanks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to\nsurvive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as th e financial crisis. And if all that\ndoesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know , through many cycles, have\nmade really substantial progre ss, more than I had thought was l ikely. So we’ve done a lot.\nNobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overc onfident that we’ve solved every problem. And,\nyou know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look a t everything and, you know,\ntrying to make—trying to—t rying to keep at it.\nSo I think those are the rea lly important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined\nnot to, you know, not to forget them . And that’s, I think, a r isk now—is to—is to forget things\nthat we—that we learned. That’ s just human nature over time.\nI saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away,\nemergency powers from the Fed? S o there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \n13, section 13(3), to provide s upport to individual nonbanks, w hich is really holding companies\nand other companies. In exchange for that, we got orderly liqu idation authority and a resolution\nauthority. Was it a mistake? I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look\nat changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting\ntools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly\nstrongly oppose efforts to tak e away more of our tools.\nYou know, the third thing you ment ioned is the designation powe r. So it’s a really\nimportant power. In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and\nthat means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have\nanother Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very\nthreatening—or it could be capab le of creating systemic risk. And so I think it’s a critical power\nto have. But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER . Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Are you\nworried about the effect of risi ng interest rates on consumers? Credit card rates have jumped to\nmore than 17 percent since the Fe d started raising interest rat es. Mortgage rates are up. What do\nyou say to consumers?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and\ninterest rates are going up acro ss a broad range of consumer bo rrowing, as they would when we\nraise short-term interest ra tes. They’re still quite low by hi storical levels. And the other thing\nI’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR A ffordability Index, housing is still\nmore affordable now than it was be fore the financial crisis. S o you’re right that the cost of\nborrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraor dinarily low levels, and it is\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nsomething that we watch carefully. You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very\nimportant channel through whic h interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi , Hannah Lang, American Banker. OCC’s decision to go at CRA\nalone suggests that there’s som e sort of disagreement among how to proceed with a joint plan.\nWhat are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, at th e Fed, we are, you know, deeply co mmitted to the\nmission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the\ncommunities they serve. And we have also been of the view for some time that with the\nevolution of technology particular ly and changes—changes in the nature of banking, that it’s an\nappropriate time—it’s past an a ppropriate time, but now it’s ce rtainly an appropriate time to\nrevisit the way we think about CRA. But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and,\nyou know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained. Many of the\nissues that we had were reflect ed in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’re— we’re hopeful that, over time,\nthere will be a joint proposed r ulemaking with the OCC, the FDI C, and the Fed. It’s a process,\nand, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance journalist filing for NPR. Mr. Chairman,\nfollowing up on the neutral rate issue—and you touched on this— but, you know, you and your\ncolleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but\nthat’s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it w as six years ago. What are the odds\nthat productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor ma rket, other developments could\nfurther push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the p rojected funds rate levels less\nrestrictive than they now seem?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in principle, the—these starred variables—the long-run\ngrowth rate of the economy, the neutral ra te of interest, the n atural rate of unemployment—don’t\nmove quickly. They move very gr adually. They’re pinned down b y longer-run forces, like\ndemographics. In the case of the funds rate, it’s more—it’s pr oductivity—it’s appetite for safe\nassets and demographics and other things, too. So they move quite slowly through time.\nI think we all look at them—those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that\nevery quarter and not make a cha nge every quarter but, every no w and again, make a change.\nAnd you’re right—we actually—t he median ticked up a tenth. It’ s a tenth we’re talking about\nhere, so—but still, I think it’ s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the\nlonger-run neutral rate and poten tially the longer-run growth r ate. Who knows? And maybe\nreducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend. It’s just that\nyou change those estimates over time. They’re informed by inco ming data. They don’t change a\nlot, though, although they did—it’s interesting that the neutra l rate changed quite sharply after\nthe financial crisis in many di fferent models, and it’s been slow to recover. I don’t expect a\ndramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at fore casting productivity. It’s just\nvery hard to know when productiv ity is going to arrive and in w hat quantity. So I think we have\nto be humble about how little we re ally know about where these starred value variables either are\nor are going.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires. Thank\nyou for taking the question. I’d lik e to just kind of ask agai n—you mentioned earlier that\ngradual—a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react. But, specifically, what are\nyou going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that may be we’ve reached the end of the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \ntightening cycle or where we s hould stop? Secondly, if you wor ry about the divergence between\ninterest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are\nunder pressure. Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know , some of the things that we’d be looking at\nto tell us whether we’re getti ng close to supply-side limits wo uld be, first, does job growth slow\ndown? A slowing down in job grow th would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp\nincrease in wages or infla tion could tell you that you’re reach ing those points. You know, if\nheadline growth slowed down, that’ s another one. So all of those things would be worth taking\ninto consideration.\nI think also, though, we’ve seen s ometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we\nsaw at the beginning of 2016, can ha ve a substantial effect pre tty quickly on our economy if it’s\na broad and significant tight ening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many\nother things.\nSo, in terms of divergence, yes. So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is\nat a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, heal thy labor market, inflation right\non target, as I mentioned. So—a nd we’ve seen growth abroad, bu t growth, I think, both in\nadvanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed do wn a little bit. And in that\nworld, you know, if the U.S. is stro nger, then that’s just part of the context, part of the\nenvironment that could mean a higher dollar. It could be—it co uld therefore mean that some of\nour demand will wind up being shared with other economies. That’s the way the integrated\ninternational economy works. So you could see that, and, you k now, it’s just—it’ s just all of\nthe—all things tha t go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nI would say, you know, we’re not res ponsible for the dollar. O f course, the Treasury is\nresponsible for managing the dol lar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it\nhad in 2017. It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year\nyet by a significant margin.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Mar ket News International. Can you give us an\nupdate on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary pol icy that the Fed made earlier\nthis year when it decoupled the i nterest on excess reserves rat e from the upper bound of the\ntarget range? And have you bee n happy with that adjustment? A nd do you see the need to make\nanother such adjustment in the near future?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the\nfederal funds rate trains—trade s within the target range. And the principal tools we use have\nbeen interest on excess reserv es and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility. So we—in\nJune, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on exce ss reserves by 20 basis points and\nraised the range by 25, and that move d federal funds sort of back into the range. It worked, and\nit was successful. The federal funds rate traded in the low 19 0s, well within the range. We\nmay—we may do that again. You know , we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them.\nWe think it’s principally a f unction just of a number of things , but particularly high Treasury\nsupply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we\ndon’t see it as a—as a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and\nwe’ll use them if we have to.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman. C ourtenay Brown from Axios. L ast month,\nthe CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth. Has the Fed looked at th at at all, and\nwhat are you seeing in terms of non wage-based compensation?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So I wouldn’t co mment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine\nthey probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I woul d just say this. So I am familiar\nwith the question and the work. You know, we look—we look at a range of indicators of wages,\nand I think the broader, the better. You really—in a perfect—a perfect wage measure would also\ninclude benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’ s right to choose those broade r ones.\nBut they’re kind of all telling the same story right now. If y ou look at the principal four\nthat we look at—we look at a w hole range of wage and benefit co st indicators—they are all now\nshowing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right? Clu stered around 3 percent. That’s\na full percentage point higher th an it was five years ago. Tha t’s a good thing. Then the\nquestion—the other question is , what about inflation? You know , if you’re—if you’re looking\nfor real wage increases, you’ ve got to ask inflation, and there , you have to pick an inflation\nmeasure. Some people pick CPI . We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures\nbecause we think it’s a little better measure. It’s a little b roader, and it tends to run a little bit\nlower as well, but that’s not w hy we pick it. We just think it’s more accurate. And that—the\ntrend there is running around 2 perc ent, so if wages are runnin g at rough—wages and benefits\nrunning at roughly 3 percent and in flation running at around 2 percent. PCE headline inflation is\nat 2.3 percent. PCE core is at a bout 2, and I think we see tha t, you know, the temporary increase\nin headline inflation as bei ng a function of oil prices probabl y, and we expect inflation to go back\ndown to 2 percent. So we think of t hat as 2 percent. That’s how we think about it. Is that—I\nhope that helps.\nMYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland, Yahoo F inance. Chair Powell, I wa nt to follow up\non something you said, actually, at Ja ckson Hole. You were talking about longer-te rm structural\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nchallenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which\nhas long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I’m just wondering if you could, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts\nthere and if this is an issue th at comes up among members of th e FOMC at all.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn’t really come up. It’s not reall y our job. And we\ndo—we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of\nthing. We don’t have responsibil ity for fiscal policy. But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will\nhave a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have\ncommented on fiscal policy. But the y’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to\nget involved in particular , you know, particular measures. And so—and I—my plan is to kind of\nstick to the same appro ach and stay in our lane.\nAnd, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time\nthat with our uniquely expensive he alth-care delivery system and the aging of our population,\nwe’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from it. In the\nend, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better. And also, these are good times. These are, you know, this is—this is the economy a t nearly full employment or in\nthe range—in the neighborhood of f ull employment. Interest rat es are low. It’s a—it’s a good\ntime to be addressing these thi ngs. So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that.\nTAKESHI KAWANAMI. I’m Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper. Thank you\nfor taking my question. I’d like to ask about emerging markets. What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emergi ng markets—interest rate, curr ency depreciation, or capital\noutflow from emerging countri es? And do you think there is a p ossibility to stop t he interest rate\nhike due to emerging markets turmoil—due to turmoil in emerging markets?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorr y, the second question was?\nTAKESHI KAWANAMI. There is a possibility to stop the . . .\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, to stop. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. . . . hike. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is a ssigned to us by\nCongress, and that is to have max imum employment and stable pri ces. About half of global\nGDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United\nStates and in emerging markets, I should say. And so the perfo rmance in the emerging market\neconomies really, really matte rs to us in carrying out our dome stic mandate. I’d also say that,\nyou know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying thi ngs and the economy is\ngrowing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a\ngood thing.\nNow, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is strong and we’re\nraising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates arou nd the world and can affect\ncountries, particularly countries that have significant externa l dollar borrowing. And what we try\nto do is be very transparent a bout what we’re doing and why. A nd we have been, I believe, and\nwe’ve also moved quite gradually. So I—you know, I think we’ve been performing well on that front.\nThere are some countries that are—that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them,\nand—but not most emerging market countries. It’s a relatively small number, and those\nparticular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabil ities, which are w ell known in the\nform of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrow ings, and high inflation, and things\nlike that. So, again, we’ll cont inue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \npossibly can, and that’s really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth. I’ll\njust—I think that answers both your questions, actually.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. Y ou mentioned\nearlier a possible, not probable , correction, and I want to com e back to the high level of the stock\nmarket. Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that w e are witnessing an episode of\nirrational exuberance or rationa l exuberance? And if there was a steep correction, would it\nprovoke financial stability concerns?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So I don’t comme nt on the appropriateness of the level of stock\nprices. I can say that by some valuation measures, they’re in the upper range of their historical\nvalue ranges. But, you know, I wouldn’ t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the\nconsequences of a market corr ection should be. You know, we would—we would look very\ncarefully at the nature of it, a nd I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are\nborrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value. So that’s a\nreally serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing\nvalues fall. And we know that that’s a really bad situation. A simple drop in equity prices is—\nall by itself, doesn’t really have those features. It could certainly feature—it could certainly\naffect consumption and have a ne gative effect on the economy, though.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chair man. Mark Hamrick with Bank rate.com .\nOne thing that’s changed since the crisis is, the majority of m ortgages issued last year came from\nso-called nonbank lenders, as trad itional banks scaled back. W hat confidence do you have about\nsupervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given the role of housing finance in the\ncrisis? Thank you.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s a good que stion. So you’re right that a lot of mortgages are\nnow originated outside the s ystem. Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards\nto be bought by the GSEs. I think we—if we look at mortgage cr edit more broadly, though, what\nwe see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit—\ngood credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with\nlow scores and perhaps troubled credit history. You know, it’s —have we—have we set—have\nwe got that exactly right? I don’t know. I mean, I—but that’s clearly—that’s the reality. In\nterms of those institutions, t hey do have supervision by the CF PB and other state regulators. But\nyou’re right. They’re much—much of the origination process has moved outside the banking\nsystem, and it’s something we monitor."
