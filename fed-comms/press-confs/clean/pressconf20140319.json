  "text": "CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. I am pleased to join you for the first of my post -\nFOMC press conferences. Like Chairman Bernanke before me, I appreciate the opportunity\nthese press conferences afford to explain the decisions of the FOMC and respond to your\nquestions.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two- day meeting earlier today. As you\nalready know from our s tatement, the Committee decided to make another modest reduction in\nthe pace of its purchases of longer -term securities. The Committee also updated its guidance\nregarding the likely future path of the short -term interest rates. As I’ll explain more fully in a\nmoment, this change in our guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee ’s policy\nintentions as set forth in its recent statements; rather, the change is meant to clarify how the\nCommittee anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment r ate declines below 6 ½ percent.\nLet me explain the economic outlook that underlies these actions.\nDespite some softer recent data, the FOMC’s outlook for continued progress toward our\ngoals of maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains broadly unchanged.\nUnusually harsh weather in January and February has made assessing the underlying strength of the economy especially challenging. Broadly speaking, however, the spending and production data, while somewhat weaker than we had expected in January, are roughly in line with our expectations as of December, the last time Committee participants submitted economic\nprojections. In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to improve. The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, is three -tenths lower than the data available at the time of the December\nmeeting. Further, broader measures of unemployment —such as the U -6 measure, which\nincludes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full -time\n\nwork —have fallen even more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor\nforce participation has ticked up. While the Committee continues to monitor developments in\nglobal financial markets carefully, financial conditions remain broadly consistent with the\nFOMC’s objectives. In sum, the FOMC continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the\neconomy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.\nInflation has continued to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent objective. Given that\nlonger -term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, and in light of the ongoing\nrecovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective. The Committee is mindful that\ninflation running persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance. The Committee also recognizes, however, that policy actions tend to exert pressure on inflation that is\nmanifest only gradually over time. The F OMC will continue assessing incoming data carefully\nto ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum\nemployment and inflation of 2 percent.\nThis outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submi tted in conjunction\nwith this meeting by the 16 FOMC participants —4 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank\npresidents. As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy. The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections has\nshifted down by about two- tenths since December and now stands at between 6.1 and 6.3 percent\nat the end of this year. The unemployment rate is projected to reach its longer -run normal level\nby the end of 2016. The cent ral tendency of the projections for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 to\n3 percent for 2014 and remains somewhat above that of the estimates of longer -run normal\ngrowth through 2016. Meanwhile, as I noted, FOMC participants continue to see inflation\n\nmoving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands. The central\ntendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, rising to 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.\nLet me now return to our decision to make another measured reduction in the pace of\nasset purchases. Starting next month, we will be purchasing $55 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate. Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to significantly expand our holdi ngs of longer -term securities, and we will also continue\nto roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in agency mortgage -backed\nsecurities. These si zable and still- increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on\nlonger -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more\naccommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee ’s\nobjective.\nThe FOMC views today’s decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases as consistent\nwith the decisionmaking framework laid out last December and still in place today. As before, if incoming information broadly supports the Committee ’s expect ation of ongoing improvement in\nlabor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the\nCommittee will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future\nmeetings. However, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee ’s decisions about\nthe pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nToday the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short -term\ninterest rates. As emphasized in the statement, the new guidance does not indicate any change in\n\nthe policy intentions of the FOMC but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face. Let me\nexplain this more fully.\nIn December 2012, the Committee first stated its guidance in terms of economic\nthresholds , stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be\nappropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, inflation is\nprojected to be no more than a half percentage point above our longer -run goal, and longer -term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored. Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee had\nexpected. Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”\nToday the Committee has fur ther revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions\nas they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters. The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC’s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short -\nterm interest rates. In particular , the Committee states that “[ i]n determining how long to\nmaintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.” In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the\nrespective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range.\n\nThe FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information , including measures\nof labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and\nreadings on financial developments.\nAs I’ve noted, the FOMC’s assessment of these factors at present is consistent with the\ncharacterization provided in previous forward guidance. The Committee continues to anticipate\nthat conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a\nconsiderable time after the asset purchase program ends , especi ally if projected inflation\ncontinues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored .”\nThe FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset\npurchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred. The statement continues to note that in deciding on the pace for removing accomm odation, the\nCommittee will take a balanced approach to attaining its objectives. The statement now adds the\nCommittee ’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-\nconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some t ime, warrant keeping ” short -term interest\nrates “ below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is\nconsistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds ra te for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values\nat the end of 2016. Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer -run normal level, many cite the residual\nimpacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.\n\nIn summary, the Committee ’s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the\nlabor market is continuing, but that much re mains to be done on both the jobs and inflation\nfronts. Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long -term unemployment remain\nsignificant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC’s objective. These\nconditions warrant the continuation of highly accommodative policy reflected in today’s policy statement. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still -increasing\nholdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly\naccommodative, promoting the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nThank you. I’ll be glad to take your questions.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER . Madam Chair, Marty Cruts inger with the Associated Press.\nCould you give us a little insight in how the decision was made on dropping the 6½ percent\nnumerical target in the forward guidance? Was there any concern expres sed that there ’s been\ncriticism on forward guidance, that it’ s confusing markets , not helping t hem in some ways? W as\nthere concern expressed that perhaps it would have been better to go to jus t a lower target , say,\n6 percent? And could you also address the concerns raised in the dissent that by dropping this , it\nlowers the commitment on fighting low inflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Thanks. Well, as I mentioned in my statement, the reason the\nCommittee felt that the time ha d come to revise the forward guidance is not because we think it\nhas not been effective. I believe the Committee does think it ’s been effective. I think it ’s had a\nvery useful impact in helping markets understand our expectations and shaping their own. But it\nis becoming —as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6½ percent , to breaching that\nthreshold tha t seems like the one that is likely to be breached . The question is : Markets want to\nknow, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?\n\nSo the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the\npast, even though it is qualitative information , about what we will be looking at as the\nunemployment rate declines below 6½ percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds\nrate at this 0 to ¼ percent range. And , as I said, we’ ve tried to give a general formulation of\nwhat we ’ll be looking at , which is : How far are we? How large are the shortfalls in achieving\nour goals ? And how fast do we expect progress to be ? Th at will be the main factors we’ ll be\nlooking at. We initially started with an unemployment rate as a threshold. That was easy\nenough for the Committee to say , “With an unemployment rate above 6½ percent, we know\nwe’re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our\nmandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wo uldn’ t dream of raising the\nfederal funds rate target. ”\nNow, the Committee has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for\nthe labor market. I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment\nrate is probably as good a one as I could find. But in assessing the real st ate of slack in the labor\nmarket and ultimately of in flationary pressures that might—or deflationary pressur es that could\nresult from that—it’ s appropriate to look at many more things. And that ’s why the Committee\nnow states we will look at a broad range of info rmation. So the closer we get as we narrow in on\ncoming closer to the target we want to achieve, w e will be carefully considering many indicators\nof how close are we to our tar gets. S o those are the main reasons.\nNow, you asked as well about the dissent. President Kocherlakota felt —I believe he\nnoted in his dissent that he endorses the new guidance about the likely path of the fed eral funds\nrate after we begin to finally raise it. And that indicates that it’ s unlikely to be back to normal\nlevels for some time , but he questions whether or not the reformulated forward guidance shows\n\nsufficient commitment of the Committee to its 2 pe rcent inflation objective. And I will simply\nsay on my own behalf , and on behalf of the Committee , that we are fully committed to the\n2 percent inflation objective , and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period\nof time. As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags , so, the policies we have in place,\nwe think, will gradually —only gradually —move inflation back to 2 percent . But if the\nCommittee had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I\nfeel confident that the Committee would act to prevent that.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen , in the\ninterest rate projections made by FOMC participants that supplement your statement, there\nseems to be a slight upward drift in the expectations for rates going out to 2016. For instance, a majority of officials see rates at 1 percent or higher in this forecast round. In the last forecast\nround, a majority saw officials less than 1 percent. I wonder if you could explain why there is\nthis small upward drift in expected rates among Committee members, whether these projections\nare a good guide for the public about where rates —about the path of rates going forward, and\nalso how you reconcile this upward drift with the assurances that the Committee makes in its\nstatem ent that rates will stay below normal levels well into the future.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, to my mind, there is only very limited upward drift. You\nknow, the Committee —I think the Committee , in assessing the economy —if you compare\ntoday ’s assessment with December ’s, is virtually identical. A lmost nothing has changed in the\noverall Committee assessment of the outlook. A s I mentioned, unemployment has come down.\nThe labor market more broadly , I think, has improved a little more tha n we might have expected ,\nand that slightly more rapid improvement in the unem ployment picture might explain —I can ’t\nspeak for why people write down what they do, but —a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.\n\nBut, more generally, I think that one should not look to the dot plot , so to speak, as the\nprimary way in which the Committee wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large.\nThe FOMC statement is the device that the Committee as a policy making group uses to express\nits opinions, a nd we have expressed a number of opinions about the likely path of rates . In\nparticular, the Committee has endorse d the view that it anticipates it will be a considerable\nperiod after the asset purchase program ends before it will be appropriate to begin to raise rates.\nAnd, of course , on our present path, well, that ’s not utterly preset. We would be looking at next\nfall. So, I think that ’s importa nt guidance.\nLooking further out, let ’s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants\nare projecting that the employmen t situation —that the unemployment rate will be close to their\nnotions of mandate -consistent or longer -run normal levels. What you see, I think, if you look\nthis time —if you gaze at the picture from December or September , which is the first year that we\nshowed those dot plots for the end of 2016, is the massiv e points that are notably below w hat the\npartici pants believe is the normal longer -run level for nominal short -term rates, and the\nCommittee today , for the first time , endorsed that as a Committee view. So I think that ’s\nsignificant. I think that ’s what we should be paying attention to, and I would si mply warn you\nthat these dots are going to move up and down over time a little bit this way or that. The dots move d down a little bit in December relative to September , and they moved up ever so slightly.\nI really don ’t think it’ s appropriate to read very much into it.\nMore generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way out. M onetary policy will be\ngeared to evolving conditions in the economy , and the public does need to understand that as\nthose views evolve, the Committee ’s views on policy will likely evolve with them. A nd that ’s a\nkind of uncertainty that the Committee wouldn’ t want to eliminate completely from its guidance\n\nbecause we want the policy we put in place to be appropriate to the economic conditions that will\nprevail years down the road.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC. I wish to look not to the dots ,\nbut to the statement, as you suggest, Madam Chair , and that one particular paragraph, which says\nthat the Committee anticipates a lower -than-normal rate even once you return to the long run.\nSo, just so I understand correctly, it mea ns that once you hit the longer -run unemployment rate of\n5—which is the central tendency average of being 5.4 per cent—once you get a 2 percent\ninflation rate, the market should not , then , anticipate the longer -run 4 percent fed funds rate, a nd\nthat woul d be question one. Question two is , doesn’ t that implicitly suggest a shallower glide\npath once you take off , or once fed funds rate s would begin —when you first hike them?\nWouldn’ t that suggest a shallower glide path to the funds rate?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the\nCommittee is expressing here, I would say , is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years\nfrom now ba sed on its —the understanding that we ’ve developed about what are the economic\nforces that have been driving economic activity.\nWe’ve had a series of years now in which growth has proven disappointing. N ow,\nmembers of the Committee have different views about why this is likely to be true , that the funds\nrate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective —they maybe\nhave slightly different views on exactly why it ’s likely to be the case that interest rates will be a\nlittle lower than they would in the longer run. But for many, it’ s a matter of headwinds from the\ncrisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative. So,\nsome examples I would say is, we have under —many households are undergoing balance sheet\nrepair. There are many underwater mortgage holders , difficulties therefore in gaining access to\n\ncredit —for example, through home equity lines of credit . For some , that makes it difficult to\nfinance small busin esses. Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine\ncredit scores . That’s improve d somewhat over time , but it ’s not back to normal . For some ,\nfiscal policy is somewhat tighter than would be expected over the next several years. For some ,\nit’s headwinds from the global economy play a role as well.\nBut the general assessment is that even after we’ve had an accommodative monetary\npolicy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives,\nthe stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve\nsomewhat lower than would be normal short -term interest rates. Now, eventually , years later,\nmost people think they will go back up. But, as you sa id, that suggests the path will be gradual.\nBut I do want to emphasize , this is a forecast , and this is the Committee ’s forecast based on its\nunderstanding of the economy at this time . And as we watch the economy over the next several\nyears , that could e volve.\nYLAN MUI. Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post . You mentioned in your testimony on\nCapitol Hill recently that the Fed was trying to assess the balance of weather effects versus more fundamental weakness in the economy as the reason for the slowdown in growth in the first\nquarter , and you guys mentioned in the statement weather specifically. Does that mean that the\nFed’s analysis has come down on the side of weather, or are you still concerned t hat there could\nbe something else going on that could be contributing to slower growth ? And you guys also\nlowered your forecast for GDP growth this year .\nCHAIR YELLEN. So , I’d say , certainly the analysis that we’ ve done —and we did spend\na lot of time discussing weather and how it ’s affected businesses and households in various parts\nof the country —certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity\n\nin Q1. It’s not the only factor that is at work, and most proje ctions for growth in the first quarter\nare reasonably weak . It’s an important factor. It’s not the only factor. But I would say it ’s\nlikely in the view of most of the Committee to begin to wash out in the second quarter , and we\ncan even see some rebound .\nNow, I would say , I know what we ’ve said about weather is a little bit complicated and\nconfusing. So, you know, let me just say between December and January , the Committee saw\ndata that le d it to be quite a bit more optimistic about the economic outlook. So I would say\nincoming data since January , when our statement sounded quite an optimistic tone , partly down\ndue to weather and partly down because we probably over did the optimism in January. So , in\nsome sense , our views have moved around here a little bit, but if we take December to March ,\nthe Committee ’s views are largely unchanged.\nJIM PUZZA NGHERA. Hi, Madam Chairwoman. I’m Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A.\nTimes. You ’ve been on—you’ve served on the Fed previously. I’m wondering , now , in the past\nfew weeks as C hairwoman, what ’s been different about being on the Fe d in your responsibilities\nas Chair, compared to being just a B oard of Governors member?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, thanks. I feel I ’m very lucky that I ’ve had a lot of Fed\nexperience to draw on as I approach this role because it ’s complicated , and now in many ways I\nfeel the buck stops with me in terms of management of the FOMC and responsibility to assure\nthat the Federal Reserve makes progress on its goals of getting the economy back on track and\nmaking progress on our financial stability and regulation objectives . So I feel that weight of\nresponsibility keenly in the new role I have, and I ’m very committed to making sure that I\nprovide the leadership that ’s necess ary for the Federal Reserve S ystem to move forward on these\ngoals. But, you know, in terms of the conduct of business, it ’s pretty much the same as usual.\n\nI’m not envisioning , nor have there been so far , any radical changes in how the Federal Reserve\ndoes its business, and that includes operating the FOMC.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Madam Chair, given that\nthe new qualitative guidance doesn’ t give any information about how you will trade off your\nunemployment and inflation objectives, does it a ctually give us any information? How will you\ntrade off the risk of higher inflation versus faster progress on unemployment as you get closer to\nfull employment? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I’d say so far we haven ’t had that tradeoff to make because\ninflation is r unning well below our objective, a nd by any measure there remains substantial slack\nin the labor market. So tradeoffs and worrying about doing more or less because we have\nconflicting objectives, this really has not been an element in our discussions about how to be\nconducting policy now. As we get closer to meeting our goals , it could become an element, a nd\nI would say that we ’ve given guidance in the statement —and we gave perhaps more guidance in\nour so- called consensus statement or statement of longer -run goals and mon etary policy\nstrategies that we ’ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row —that the Committee would take a\nbalanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we ’re faced with tradeoffs\nbetween inflation and unemployment.\nWhen we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where\nsuch a tradeoff could arise, where we might fa ce a situation where unemployment was quite\nhigh—namely , over 6½ percent —and inflation might be drifting close to 2 or even a little bit\nabove 2. And our threshold- based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would\ntolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero. And to the extent that that concrete guidance is usef ul,\n\nthe—I don ’t believe that ’s a situation that we ’re likely —if I thought that that was a situation we\nwere likely to encounter in the next several years, we probably would have revised our forward\nguidance in a different way. We revised it as we did , eliminating that language , because it\ndoesn’ t seem like a situation that’ s at all likely. But I would point you to the statement —the\n statement in th is statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating\nany change in our policy i ntentions , and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between\nour inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation.\nANN SAPHIR. Ann Saphir with Reuters. First, I just wanted a quick clarification. You\nsaid that something would happen by next fall , and we—on a clear path —on a path until next\nfall. I was unclear if you were speaking of rate hikes or if you were speaking —\nCHAIR YELLEN. I simply meant to say that if we continued to reduce the pace of our\nasset purchases in the manner that we have, in measured steps , that the program would be\nwinding down next fall.\nANN SAPHIR. In this coming fall, you mean , not the fall of next year, is that—just —\nCHAIR YELLEN. Yes, this coming fall.\nANN SAPHIR. To be clear —I just wanted to be clear about that. Then once you do\nwind down the bond buying program, could you tell us how long of a gap we might expect before the rate hikes do begin?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, the language that we use in the statement is “ considerable ”\nperiod. So, I —you know, this is the kind of term —it’ s hard to define. But, you know, it\nprobably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing. But, you\nknow, it depends . What the statement is saying is , it depends what conditions are like. We need\nto see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal —that will be a\n\ncomplicated assessment not just base d on a single statistic —and how rapidly are we moving\ntoward it ? Are we really close and moving fast? Or are we gettin g closer but moving very\nslowly? And then, what the statement emphasizes , and this is the same language we used in\nDecember and January, we used the language especially if inflation is running below our\n2 percent objective. Inflation matters here , too, and our general principle tries to capture that\nnotion. If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below\nour 2 percent objective , that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for\nlonger.\nBINYA MIN APPELBAUM. The Committee ’s Vice Chairman , Bill Dudley , said\nrecently, “ If the economy decided it was going to grow at 5 percent or the economy decided it\nwasn ’t going to grow at all, those would be the kind of changes in the outlook that I think would\nwarrant changing the pace of taper [ing].” Is that an accurate description of what you mean when\nyou say that you ’re not on a preset course, anything between zero to five? And, secondly , if I\nmay, there ’s a lot of research showing that short -term unemployment seems to be responsible for\nthe level of inflation and that long -term unemployment seems relatively uncorrelated. Is that the\nFed’s view at this point? Is that one reason that you expect inflation to rebound in the next\ncouple of years?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of\ndefining what we ’d need to see. I wouldn’ t go to such extremes. I guess the way I would put it\nis this : There are two conditions for the Committee to decide to continue tapering the pace of\npurchases. The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend\nand that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in the labor\nmarket that will get us back to our maximum employment objective. And , second of all, we\n\nneed to see— and now coming back to inflation again—inflation is low , and it ’s been running\nwell below our objective. And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that\ninflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time .\nIf the Committee no longer feels comfortable making such assessments —so, if there is\nenough change in the data we ’re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or\nconvincing to make those two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the\npace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan. So 5 percent and 1 percent, those\nare very extreme numbers. But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.\nWith respect to the issue of short -term unemployment and its being more relevant for\ninflation and a better measure of the labor market, I ’ve seen res earch along those lines. I think it\nwould be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on\neither how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market. So I think this is something our Committe e will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other\nlabor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve. We ’ll be looking at a broad range of\nindicators. We ’re looking to see progress on many different dimensions where we see slack in\nthe economy, but I wouldn’ t endorse, and I certainly don’ t think our Committee would endorse,\nthe judgment of the research that you cited.\nJEFF KE ARNS. Jeff Ke arns from Bloomberg News. You’ve spoken in the past about —\nthinking about back to March of la st year —of how you supplement your view of the labor\nmarket beyond unemployment with other gauges like qui t rates and lay offs and things like that.\nHow has your dashboard evolved in the past few months in terms both of the —which indicators\n\nyou like to watch most, and also in terms of the quality of data that you think—whether it ’s\npositive, negative —that you ’re getting from these indicators. Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I have talked in the past about indicators I like to watch or I think\nthat are relevant in assessing the labor market. In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I\ncertainly look at broader measures of unemployment. I mentioned U -6 in my statement. It—\n5 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that ’s an exceptionally\nhigh number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it—so, to my mind, is a form of\nslack that is —adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large.\nHowever, it is coming down, as well as U -3. It’s movi ng in the right direction and has moved\neven more recently than U -3. Of course, I watch discouraged and marginally attached workers.\nThe share of long -term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in\nbringing down, that’s something t hat I watch closely . Again, that remains exceptionally high,\nbut it has come down from something like 45 percent to high 30s, but that ’s certainly on my\ndashboard. Labor force participation— I do think most research suggests that due to\ndemographic factor s, labor force participation will be coming down, and there has been a\ndownward trend now for a number of years. But I think there is also a cyclical component in the\nfact that labor force participation is depressed. And so, it may be that as the economy begins to\nstrengthen, we could see labor force participation flatten out for a time as discouraged workers start moving back into the labor market. And so that ’s something I ’m watching closely.\nIn the Committee , we’ll have to watch —there are different views on this within the\nCommittee , and it ’s hard to know definitively what part of labor force participation is structural\nversus cyclical , so it’s something to watch closely. I’ve also mentioned, in the past , measures of\nlabor market turnover. You mentioned quits. A remarkably large share of workers quit their\n\njobs every month, usually going directly into another job. And I take the quit rate in many ways\nas a sign of the health of the economy. When workers are scared they won’ t be able to get other\njobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs. Now, quit rates now are below normal\npre-recession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time , and so we have seen\nimprovement. The job opening rate has also come up. The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed , and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market. But most of these\nmeasures, although they don’ t paint the identical extent of improvement, if you ask about my\ndashboard, the dial on virtual ly all of those things is moving in a direction of improvement.\nThe thing I ’d mention is wages , and wage growth has really been very low. I know\nthere is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of w age increase are running at very low levels. In fact, with the productivity growth\nwe have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see , on an ongoing basis ,\nsomething between—perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal. Wage inflation\nhas been running at 2 percent. So not only is it depressed, signaling weakness in the labor market, but it is certainly not flashing . An increase in it might signal some tightening or\nmeaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time. And I would say we ’re not seeing that.\nWYATT ANDREWS. Madam Chair, Wyatt Andrews from CBS. For tens of millions of\nAmericans, the recovery is an awful long time coming. May we know your thoughts on why the recovery is so slow , and why the economy is not creating more jobs?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think the short answer is that we have lived through a\ndevastating financial crisis that has taken an exceptional toll on the economy in many different ways, from housing to leaving a huge number of homeowners with mortgages living in homes\nwith mortgages that are underwater , has had a highly negative effect on their credit ratings and\n\ntheir ability to access credit, has left businesses with very cautious attitudes that we see in\nbusines s investment spending that is very restrained. On top of that, we ’ve had weakness in the\nglobal economy , and we ’ve had a very tight fiscal policy at home . After stimulus a t the onset of\nthe recession, we ’ve had a good deal of fiscal consolidation in the United States and, at a time\nwhen fiscal policy normally in the past would have been serving to create jobs, fiscal policy from that standpoint has served as a headwind to the recovery. And at the federal —especially at the\nfederal level , but also with sta te and local levels as well. And so we have had a disappointing\nrecovery. And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that. But, you know, the\nlinkages aren ’t as strong and aren ’t as quick as we might ideally like them to be.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. I’d like to take you back to last summer when there were\nhints —the Fed made hints that they were going to taper, and long -term interest rates spiked,\nmortgage rates rose. What lessons —looking back at that crisis, at that period, what lessons have\nyou learned from it , and are you confident that you won’ t repeat that —those mistakes again?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think there were quite a number of things happening at that\ntime. I think it ’s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role in touching off that\nmarket reaction, but I think the market reaction was exacerbated by the fact that we had a very significant unwinding of carry trades and other leveraged positions that investors had taken,\nperhaps thinking that the level of volatilit y was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was\nsafe for them to have assumed. But we certainly saw —now, in some ways, the fact that term\npremia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that ’s evident in housing —in the slowdown in housing —perhaps it ’s diminished\nsome financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time. A lesson is that we will try, and w e\n\nwere trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about\nhow we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain —given that the economic\ndevelopments in the economy are themselves uncertain —but we will try as hard as we can not to\nbe a source of instability here.\nREBECCA JARVIS. Madam Chair, Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News. One of the drivers last\nspring and summer of home prices and home sales was that sense that interest rates were going\nup, that they were spiking . And now, a year later, we ’re looking essentially at a flat interest rate\npicture as far as homebuyers are concerned . So, is there any sense on your Committee that\nstaying at this level loses its punch the longer we remain here? And if I ’m a buyer, and I ’m\nthinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels.\nAnd the level of household formation is very depressed, has been very depressed for some time. There are a lot of ki ds who were shacking up with their families and probably would like to be\ngoing out and acquiring places of their own, whether it ’s an apartment or a home. There ’s a lot\nof demographic potential there for new household formation that would ultimately gene rate new\nconstruction, either sing le or multifamily, and the level of rates I think does matter. And the fact\nthat they ’re low now , I think, is something that should serve as a stimulus to people coming back\ninto the housing market. And what we ’ve not ye t seen—the pickup after the lull—after interest\nrates went up last summer, I do expect housing activity to begin to expand more rapidly later on. I don ’t think it’ s only the expectation that “ I have to move now or things will be more expensive\nlater” that spurs those decisions . So—\n\nKATE DAVIDSON. Hi, Kate Davidson from Politico. Much has been made about the\nfact that you and your predecessor agreed on many policies. You shared a lot of the same policy\nviews. Can you tell us one way in which your chair manship will be different than Ben\nBernanke’ s?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think we are committed to exactly the same set of goals. And,\nyou know, as I indicated, I—my goal, and I will, you know, throw myself into this as\nwholeheartedly as I can, is to make rapid progress, as rapid progress as we possibly can in getting this recovery back on track and putting Americans back to work and into jobs, and in moving inflation back up to levels at the Committee ’s target of 2 percent. My predecessor was\nalso devoted t o that. Strengthening the financial system is a work in progress , and he made large\ninroads in strengthening the financial system. I’d just say , there is more work to be done, I have\na long to- do list. I would absolutely —it’ s high priority for me to see further work done in\naddressing too- big-to-fail. We have a to -do list of things we want to accomplish, and in\nassessing threats to financial stability because neither one of us —and no one wants to live\nthrough a financial crisis like the last one , and we want to be extremely cognizant of emerging\nthreats to the financial system. So I haven ’t answered your question by saying that I will be\ndifferent, but I think he had a very good agenda , and it ’s one I shared. It’s why I came to\nWashington to be V ice C hair, and it ’s the agenda I expect to continue pursuing.\nPETER BARNES. Madam Chair, Peter Barnes of Fox Business. I wanted to talk about\ninternational developments and the crisis in the Ukraine. Is the crisis a headwind for the U.S.\neconomy? Are there r isks to the U.S. economy and the U.S. banking system , directly and\nindirectly? And did the Russians move $100 billion in U.S. Treasury securities out of the United\n\nStates in the last couple of weeks to avoid U.S. sanctions? Those are—those foreign securi ties\nare held by the Fed. Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start with the last piece of your question first. I’m sorry ,\nI—movements in custodial accounts at the New York Fed are something that I can ’t—I’m not in\nthe position to be able to comment about. But in terms of the situation in Ukraine and Russia,\nit’s something that we ’re monitoring very closely. We discussed in our meeting the direct -trade\nlinkages or exposures of the U.S. banking system to the Ukraine and Russia are not large. That’s —we ’re not seeing meaningful impacts now, but obviously there are geopolitical risks\nhere that it ’s very important for us to be attentive to and to keep our eye on. And we ’re not\nseeing broader global financial r epercussions, but if this were to escalate, that would certainly be\nsomething that would be on our radar screen, but we ’re not seeing —we ’re not seeing that now\nand we ’re monitoring it closely.\nVICTORIA MCGRANE. Victoria McGrane from Dow Jones Newswires. You ’ve\nspoken about how unemployment is more than just statistics to you. And I wanted to ask, when you ma ke that statement, who do you have in mind or —and what do you do, if anything , to keep\nin touch with that kind of human side of the impact of the economic crisis and slow recovery that we’ve had?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I ’d be surprised if anyone in this room doesn’ t know someone\nwho has been touched by the crisis, by unemployment, by difficulties in getting jobs, and that is\ntrue of me and my family and friends, I think, as it is probably for many of you. I talk to a broad\nrange of business contacts and try to stay in touch with what ’s happening with real people in the\neconomy. We have —do a lot of work in community development in the Fed and have groups\ncome to talk to us and explain to us how their communities have been affected by the economic\n\nsituation and by the housing crisis. When I was in San Francisco, we worked —you know, we\nhad programs there, we worked very closely , particularly in low -income communities that have\nbeen very badly affected, to design programs that could potentially be helpful. We tried to study\nwhat kinds of programs can be most effective and to try to under stand what kinds of advice we\ncould give to those in the community development lending field to help. So I do try to listen to people that represent communities that are experiencing the worst of the crisis and stay in touch with it that way."
