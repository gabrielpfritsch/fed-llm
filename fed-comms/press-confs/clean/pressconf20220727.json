My colleagues and I are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools\nwe need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and\nbusinesses.\nThe economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years\nand have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inf lation down to our 2 percent goal if we\nare to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and\nprice stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the F OMC raised its policy interest rate\nby ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds r ate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly\nreducing the size of our balance sheet . And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy\nactions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicator s of spending and production have softened. Growth in consumer\nspending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also\nlooks to have declined in the second quarter.\nDespite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth\nelevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmonth—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year , but still robust. Improvements in\nlabor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the\nwage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since\nJanuary. Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid.\nInflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In June, the 12 -month change in the consumer\nprice index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was\n5.9 percent. Notwi thstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate\ndemand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than\nanticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services.\nAlthough prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of\ncrude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices\nfor gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflati on.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least abl e to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent. And we ’re continuing\nthe process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which p lays an important role\nin firming the stance of monetary policy.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing increases in\nthe ta rget range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will\ncontinue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Today’s\nincrease is the —in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.\nWhile another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicatin g—and communicate our thinking as clearly\nas possible. As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate\nto slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are\naffecting the economy and i nflation. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand\ninto better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often involves —evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised\nto the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be ni mble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to\navoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measu res necessary to return\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ninflation to our 2 percent longer -run goal. This process is likely to involve a period of below -\ntrend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions . But such outcomes are\nlikely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public miss ion. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s start with Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Ch air Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel\nfrom the Washington Post. I ’m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the\ndecision not to go for a full percentage point increase . We saw a ramp -up after the May CPI\nreport came in hotter than usual a nd then, obviously, the June figure did, too. Was there any\ndiscussion of a stronger hike at this meeting? Yes. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right\nmagnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that\nwe’ve been making. I’d say that we wouldn’ t hesitate to , to make an even larger move than we\ndid today if the Committee were to conclude that that was— that that were appropriate. That was\nnot the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made.\nYou mentioned the —the June meeting. We, we had said many times that we were\nprepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disapp oint. And\nthat’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting , as we said we would do.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nAt this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace , as inflation has continued to\ndisappoint , in the form of the June CPI reading.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with t he\nFinancial Times. As the C ommittee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the\nexpected decline in headline inflation , which might come as a result o f the drop in commodity\nprices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?\nAnd given that potential tension and signs of , you know, any kind of activity weakening here,\nhow has the Committee ’s thinking cha nged on how far into restrictive territory rates might need\nto go?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I ’d start by saying we ’ve been saying we would move\nexpeditiously to get to the range of neutral. And I think we ’ve done that now . We’re at —we’re\nat 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that ’s right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question\nis, how are we thinking about the path forward ? So one thing that hasn’ t changed is that —won ’t\nchange —is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring\ndemand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down. That ’ll\ncontinue to be our overarching focus.\nWe also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we ’ll make\ndecisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? You know, w e’ll be\nlooking at the incoming data , as I mentioned, and that ’ll start with economic activity. Are we\nseeing the slowdown that we —the slowdown in economic act ivity—that we think we need? And\nthere ’s some evidence that we are at this time. Of course, we ’ll be looking at labor market\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nconditions. And we ’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand\ngetting better, getting closer.\nOf cour se, we’ ll be looking closely at inflation. You mentioned headline and core. Our\nmandate is for headline, of course ; it’s not for core. But we look at core because core is, is\nactually a better indicator of headline a nd of all inflation going forward. So we ’ll be—we’ll be\nlooking at both. And we ’ll be looking at them for —at those both, really —for what they’ re\nsaying about the outlook rather than just simply for , for what they say. But we ’ll be asking: D o\nwe see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?\nSo, in light of all that data, the question we ’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we\nhave is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target. And it ’s also\nworth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they ’ve come —they’ve come quickly.\nAnd it ’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there ’s probably some\nadditional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeli ne.\nSo where are we going with this? I think the best —I think the C ommittee broadly feels\nthat we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level. And maybe the best data\npoint for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the —at t he June meeting . So I think\nthe median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would ’ve been between 3¼\nand 3½ [percent] . And , then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So\nthat’s—even though that ’s now six week s old, I guess, that ’s—that’s the most recent reading. Of\ncourse, we ’ll update that reading at the —at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that ’s how\nwe’re thinking about it.\nAs I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase\ncould be appropriate, but that ’s not a decision we ’re making now. It’ s one that we ’ll make based\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\non the data we see. And we ’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting. We think\nit’s—we think it’s time to just go to a meeting -by-meeting basis and not provide , you know, the\nkind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you ’ve said\nthat your policy works through influencing expectations and th at policy needs to be at least\nmoderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight. Futures market\npricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year. Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m go ing to start by pointing out that it ’s very hard to say with\nany confidence in normal times —in normal times —what the economy’ s going to be doing in\n6 or 12 months. And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be —of course, we do that in the SEP, but , nonetheless, you’ ve got to take any\nestimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt , because there ’s so much\nuncertainty.\nThese are not normal times. There ’s significantly more uncertainty now about t he path\nahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily , it’s quite high. So, again, I would—the\nbest data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP , which I think is just the most\nrecent thing that the C ommittee ’s done. Since then, inflation has come in higher ; economic\nactivity has come in weaker than expected.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nBut at the same time, I would say that ’s probably the best estimate of where the\nCommitte e’s thinking is still, w hich is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the\nend of this year —by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent —and that when the\nCommittee sees further rate increases in 2023 , as I mentioned, we ’ll update tha t, of course , at the\nSeptember meeting. But that ’s really the best I can do on that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated. Has\nyour view of the terminal rate changed since June?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’ t say it was—I think we didn’ t expect a good reading,\nbut this one —this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don ’t talk about my own\npersonal estimate of , of what the terminal rate would be. I do—I will write down that in —it’s\ngoing to evolve. Obviously, it has evolved over the course —I think , for all participants, it has\nevolved over the course of the year a s we learn how persistent inflation ’s going to be.\nAnd by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and\ntwo more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity\nand perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows. It’ ll be—it’ll be a lot. It’s an eight -week\nintermeeting period , so I think we ’ll see quite a lot of data. And we ’ll make our decision at that\nmeeting based on that data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna\nSmialek, New York Times. You kind of alluded to this earlie r, but I wonder in the event that you\nsee several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down\nso much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that .\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s hard to deal with hypotheticals , but I just would say this. We,\nyou know, we would look at both, and we would ask—we ’d be asking ourselves , are we\nconfident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent ? That ’s really the question. And we ’ll be\nmaking—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident\nthat inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent . So you would—it would depend on a lot\nof things.\nOf course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a bett er predictor of inflation going forward .\nHeadline inflation tends to be volatile. So , in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile\nmoves in commodities. The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a\nsustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn’ t distinguish between core and headline\ninflation in their thinking. So it ’s something we have to take into consideration in our\npolicymaking even though our tools don’ t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the\nsupply- side issues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr.\nChairman. Earlier this week, the P resident said , “We are not going to be in a recession.” So I\nhave two questions off of that. Do you share the President ’s confidence in not being in a\nrecession ? And, second, how would or would not a recession change polic y? Is it a bright line,\nsir, where , where contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy? Or is there\nsome amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort\nto reduce inflation?\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I —as I mentioned, we think it ’s necessary to have growth\nslow down. And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons , one of\nwhich is that you’ re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021. You ’re\nalso seeing tighter monetary policy. And you should see some slowing.\nWe actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some\nslack so that —so that the supply side can catch up. We also think that there will be, in all\nlikelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. And those are things that we expect . And\nwe think that they ’re probably necessary if we were to have— to get inflation —if we were to be\nable to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that\nmight or might not change policy. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re going to be —again, we ’re going to be focused on getting\ninflation back down. And we—as I ’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the\nbedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can ’t\nhave a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.\nWe all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic , where\ndifferences between , you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at\nhistoric minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back\nto that , but that ’s not happening. That ’s not going to happen without , without restoring price\nstability. So that ’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do. And we think\nthat in the —we don’ t see it as a tradeoff with , with the empl oyment mandate. We see it as a way\nto facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Particularly in regard to\nexpectations, it ’s been said th e last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the\nlists—the risks of doing too much. Does that remain the bias?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re trying to do just the right amount, right? We ’re not —we’re\nnot trying to have a recession. And we don’ t think we have to. We think that there ’s a path for\nus to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market , as I mentioned ,\nalong with —in all likelihood —some , some softening in labor market conditions. So that is —\nthat’s what we ’re trying to achieve , and we continue to think that there ’s a path to that. We\nknow that the path has , has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our\ncontrol. And it may narrow further.\nSo, you know , I do think —as I said ju st now —that restoring price stability is just\nsomething that we have to do. There , there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the\nthing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time. Without restoring price stability,\nyou won’ t be able, over the me dium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained\nperiod of very strong labor market conditions. So, of course , we serve both sides of the dual\nmandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But a s a—as a follow -on to that, given the uncertainty and\nthat sort of paradoxical flow of data you ’ve been getting, if you’ re going to make a mistake,\nwould you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little?\nCHAIR POWE LL. We’ re trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way : We do\nsee that there are two -sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know,\nimposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk —the ris k of\ndoing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost. If\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nyou fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later t o the\nextent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives.\nThey start to factor high inflation into their decisions —when that —on a sustained basis.\nWhen that starts to really happen, and we don’ t think that ’s happened yet, but when that starts to\nhappen, it just gets that much harder. And the pain will be that much greater. So I really do\nthink that it’ s important that we —that we address this now and get it done.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. To build a little bit on\nwhat Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the\nGDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other? And has your assessment of\nthe risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t —I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. And\nthe reason is , there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are performing, you\nknow, too well. And , of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular. As I me ntioned,\nit’s true that growth is slowing f or reasons that we understand. Really , the growth was\nextraordinarily high last year, 5 ½ percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There ’s\nalso more slowing going on now.\nBut if you look at the labor market, you ’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging\n450,000 per month. That ’s a remarkably strong level for , for this state of , of affairs . The\nunemployment rate at near a 50 -year low at 3.6 percent . All of the wage measures that we track\nare running very strong. So this is a very strong labor market, and it ’s just not consistent with —\nyou know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year . It doesn ’t make sense that the\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\neconomy would be in recession with , with this kind of thing happening. So I don’ t think the U .S.\neconomy’ s in recession right now.\nNEIL IRWIN. GDP? GDP tomorrow?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah, haven’ t seen it , and, and we’ll just have to see what it says. I\ndon’t —I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty\nsignificantly. It’ s just —it’s just that it’ s very hard —it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of]\nU.S. GDP . It’s a large economy. And a lot of —a lot of work and judgment goes into that. But\nyou tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a —with a grain of salt. But , of course, it ’s\nsomething we ’ll be looking at.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask\nabout the new conflict- of-interest rules that you all rolled out. Some s enators have written\nasking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed’s\nfinancial— the Fed officials’ financial activity. I was wondering if you could speak to that and\nwhether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way.\nCHAIR POWELL. So those are —those are the toughest rules in place , you know, at any\ncomparable institution that I’ m aware of. We think —you know, we ’ve thought about this\ncarefully, and we put them in place. And we ’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you\nknow, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually , you won’ t be able to make trades unless\nthey’ re precleared. And the amount of trades you make, they’ ll have to be 45 days or more\nbefore any F OMC meeting. It’s just —I think we ’ve really , you know, created a very strong and\nrobust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution. And , again, we ’re\njust now —the sys tem is just now up and running. And I ’m proud of what we did.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Hi. Catarina Sarai va, Bloomberg News. I\nwanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25. Can y ou talk a little\nbit about what , what kind of goes into your thinking for , you know, making the decision on how\nmuch to raise rates a nd, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?\nCould that possibly be 100 basis points? And th en, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of\nweakness in the economy , outside of inflation measures , that would lead you to slow your\nhiking pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m going to —I’m going to take that as a question about the next\nmeeting and thereafter. So, as I mentioned, we ’re going to be looking at all of those things :\nactivity, labor market, inflation. And we ’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and\nwhere does it really need to be . And I also mentioned that , as this process —now that we ’re at\nneutral —as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down. And we\nhaven’ t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right? We ’ve been\nfront -end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we ’re getting closer to where we need\nto be. So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it.\nAnd i n terms of September, we ’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving\noutlook very caref ully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to\ndo. And I ’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be. So, you\nknow, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase . But that’ s not a\ndecision that we ’ve made at all.\nSo we are—you know, we ’re going to be guided by the data. And I think you can still\nthink of the , the destination as broadly in line with the September —sorry, the June SEP , because\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nit’s only six weeks old. And sometimes , sometimes SEPs can get old really quick. I think in this\none—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the\nCommittee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year. So I would point\nyou to that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I\nwanted to ask about right now , there ’s a sort of growing gap between the F ed’s preferred\nmeasure of inflation, the PCE , PCE index, a nd the one that ’s followed by the public, the CPI, of\ncourse. How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for\nyou to consi der slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s an interesting, interesting situation. Of course, we’ ve, we’ve\nlong used PCE because we think it ’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face\nin their lives. And I think that that view is pretty widely understood. That said, the public really\nreads about CPI. And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like\nfood, gasoline, motor vehic les, and housing than the PCE index does. And so that accounts for a\nlot of the difference. However, over time, they tend to come together.\nYou know, we —given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and\nnoticing it and everything like that. But remember, we do target PCE. That is because we think\nit’s a better measure. They will come together eventually. The typical gap was really about\n25 basis points for a very long time. And if it went —if it got to 40 basis points, that would be\nvery noticeable. And now it ’s—now it’s much larger than that because of the things I\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmentioned. So we ’ll be watching both, but , again, the one that we think is the best measure\nalways has been PCE , at least since I think we —some 20 plus years ago— moved to PCE.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I ’d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman.\nMichael McK ee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. You said that the destination pretty much\nremains the same in terms of your end -of-the-year target. But where are you in the journey?\nWe’ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end. You mentioned consumer spending,\nbusiness investment have slowed. Are they moving at a pace you would expect? Or is demand\nstill greater than supply —too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?\nAnd I ask be cause there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as y ou mentioned. And a lot\nof this might hit in 2023. The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be\nweak. How, how do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, just talking about demand for a second : As I mentioned in my\nremarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter —\nconsumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think, you know,\npeople widely looked at the first -quarter numbers and thought they didn ’t make sense and might\nhave been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not , not true\nof the second quarter. But at the same time, you have this labor market.\nSo there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor\nmarket as strong. And the economy has gone right through that and been fine. So that —that ’s\nhappened many times. And it used to happen— if you remember, in the first quarter of every\nyear, for several y ears in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nfine. And it turned out to just be measurement error. It was called residual seasonality. We\ndon’t know the situation.\nThe truth is, though, we , we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it\nmoderating? We’ re not sure. We’re going to have to watch the data carefully. There are —there\nis a great deal of money on people ’s balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate\nis ver y low. The labor market ’s very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high.\nSo it’s the kind of thing where you think that the —that the economy should actually be , be doing\npretty well in the second half of the year. But we ’ll have to see. We don’ t know that because\nyou do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does —that is fairly broad. So we ’ll be\nwatching that . We’ll be watching that. Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand\nrunning below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Hi, thank you, Chairman. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.\nWhen does the C ommittee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market? An d how\nmuch weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think you ’re already seeing —you’ ve seen , in the labor market,\nwhat you’ ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year\nto modestly slower job creation —still, still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you’ re seeing that.\nYou’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, al though that may\nactually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We’re not sure that that ’s actually real.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nThere ’s some evidence that wages— if you look at average hour ly earnings, they appear\nto be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures. And we ’ll be getting the\nemployment compensation index measurement , I think, on Friday, I guess. And that ’s a very\nimportant one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.\nSo I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on\nthe part of businesses that they simply can ’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what\nit was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year. So there ’s a feeling that the labor\nmarket is moving back into balance. If you look at —if you look at job openings or quits, you see\nthem moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it’ s only the beginning of an adjustment.\nBut I think most —also, if you look at —I mean, once you start citing these things, you\ncan’t stop. If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the\nhousehold survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months. So that\nmight be a signal that job creation ’s actually a little bit slower than we ’re seeing i n the —in the\nestablishment survey. So executive summary [is]: I would say t here’s some evidence that labor\ndemand may be slowing a bit —labor supply, not so much. We have been disappointed that labor\nforce participation really hasn ’t moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big\nwave of COVID. And there ’s evidence that that ’s the case. But—So we ’re not seeing much in\nthe way of labor supply. Nonetheless, I would say some , some progress on demand and supply\ngettin g back in alignment.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept\nbefore you think about pausing rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we’re looking— we’re going to be looking at , at inflation\nas well. You know, a s I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down. We need to be\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nconfident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate -consistent levels. That ’s not\nsomething we can avoid doing. That really needs to happen.\nAnd, but we do think, though, that the labor ma rket can adjust because of the huge\noverhang of job openings , of excess demand, really. There should be able to be an adjustment\nthat would have lower than—perhaps lower -than-expected increases in unemployment —lower\nthan would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level —the ratio of, of\nvacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience. And that suggests that\nthis time could be different.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession. So how , how\nclose are we to a recession? And then how do forecast s of possible recession from banks and\neconomists, how does that make a soft landing you’ ve talked about more difficult?\nCHAIR POWELL. So as , as I mentioned, it doesn’ t seem that the U.S. economy is in\nrecession right now. And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let ’s put it that way —\nin growth. And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned. But there ’s also just\nthe very strong data coming out of the labor market, still. So, overall, you would say that , in all\nprobability, demand i s still strong , and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this\nyear. But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable. And we ’re—you know, we’re going to\nbe watching that carefully. Sorry, what was the —\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Forecast s. You know, how do bank forecast s of possible\nrecessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , you know, w e’ve said since the beginning, I think, that , that\nhaving a soft landing is what we ’re aiming for. Of course, that has t o be our goal . It is our goal.\nAnd we ’ll keep trying to achieve it. I think —I do think events —at the beginning, we said it was\nnot going to be easy. It was going to be quite challenging to do that. It’s unusual. It ’s an\nunusual event . It’s not a typical event , given where we are.\nIf there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned , that the labor\nmarket actually is —has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see —you could\nsee that demand coming down in a way that didn ’t translate into a big increase in unemployment\nas you would expect in the ordinary course because , frankly, the imbalance is so much greater.\nAnd, but we don’ t know that. I mean, t his is a—this is a case of first impression. So anyone\nwho is really sure that it’ s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably\nunderestimating the level of uncertainty. And so I would certainly say it ’s an uncertain ,\nuncertain thing. Nonetheless, it ’s our goal to achieve it, and we ’ll keep trying to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to\nask about the balance sheet reduction program. It’s been working for a couple months now and\nin a different environment than the last time the Fed did it. What are you learning about how it ’s\nworking and how markets are reacting? And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed\nin the system still s everal years away at the current pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we think it ’s working fine. As you know, we , we tapered up into\nit. And , and in September, we ’ll go to full strength. And the markets seem to have accepted it.\nBy all assessments, the market s should be able to absorb this. And we expect that ’ll be the case.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nSo I would say the plan is broadly on track. It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of\nthese trades don’t settle until—for a bit of time. But it’ ll be picking up steam.\nSo I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the\nnew equilibrium will take a while. And that time, it’ s hard to be precise, but , you know, the\nmodel would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing. And\nthis is a much faster pace than the last time. Balance sheet ’s much , much bigger than it was. But\nwe looked at this carefully , and we thought that this , this was the sensible pace. And we have no\nreason to think it ’s not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brian.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Looking at\nfinancial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10 year coming\ndown, 30- year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways , when we talk about a hot housing\nmarket still. Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you\ncontinue to raise rates.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a big piece of that is inflation expectations —you know,\nbreakevens coming down, w hich, you know, is a good thing. It’s a good thing that markets do\nseem to have confidence in , in the C ommittee ’s commitment to getting inflation back down to\n2 percent . So we like to see market -based , you know, readings of inflation expectations come\ndown. You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit. I mean, t he\nway this works is we , we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial\nconditions are what affects the economy.\nAnd we don ’t control that second step. We’ re just going to do what we think needs to be\ndone. We’ re going to— we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ninflation will be moving back down to 2 percent . Confident. So that ’s how we ’re going to take\nit. And , of course, we ’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight\nand that they’ re having the effect th at we would hope they’ re having, which is to see demand\nmoderate and inflationary pressures recede and , ultimately , inflation come down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I wonder if\nyou can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation , when the\nCommittee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases. I think it was December\n2020. There ’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that a nd saying that maybe\nthat was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind— not his words but\nmaybe , you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation. So could you talk about\nthat decision , and have you looked at it in hindsig ht at all? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, ye s, we said that we wouldn’ t lift off until we had basically\nachieved our dual -mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that , the first look at\nthe new framework that we ’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “I t’s not credible . You’ll\nnever get inflation to 2 percent .” Some of our critics now who say inflation’ s too tight —too high\nwere the same ones who were saying , “You’ll never get to 2 percent .” Well, but anyway , that’s\nwhat happened.\nSo we , we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn ’t part\nof the framework. The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. I t\nwas just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don’ t think that that\nhas materially changed the situation. But I have to admit, I don’ t think I would do that again. I\ndon’t think I would do that again. We —you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nunexpected way for all of us. And , you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more\nflexibility than that.\nBut did it matter in the end? You know, we —if you look at —I really don ’t think it did .\nI’m not sure it would’ ve mattered if we ’d been raising rates three months earlier . Does anybody\nthink that would’ ve made a big difference? I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three\nmonths earlier , and it didn’ t matter. I mean, this is a—this is a global ph enomenon that ’s\nhappening now —admittedly, different in the United States , but anyway.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nGREG ROBB. Can I follow up?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that, Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Just a lot of people talk about that time , and they talk about a taper\ntantrum. I know you haven’ t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time\nabout repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a G overnor. So was that part of\nthat? Where did that fit into all those decisions ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we learned—there ’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?\nSo there was the famous one in 2013. There ’s what happened at the December ’ 18 meeting,\nwhere , you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end\nand then suddenly react very sharply. So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably\nand doing it in steps and things like that. It was just like that’ s how we did it. And so we did it\nthat way this time. We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that\nkind of thing. Ye s, we were trying to avoid a tantrum b ecause they can be quite destructive.\nThey can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter. And, you know, when it\nhappens, you have to—really , in both ’ 13 and ’ 18, it really had consequences for the real\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\neconomy, you know, two, three, four months later. So we were trying t o avoid that. That was\npart of it.\nAgain, I don ’t think that’ s—the real issue of 2020 and ’ 21 was just trying to understand\nwhat was happening with the reopening economy. That , that was where the big uncertainty was.\nAnd, you know, our view was that these supply -side issues would get better : that people would\ngo back to work, that labor force participation would come back, e veryone would get vaccinated,\nschools would open, kids would be in school , and labor force participation would jump back up.\nThat’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case : these supply- side issues\nwould get solved reasonably quickly. A nd they just haven’ t. They still haven’ t.\nSo that ’s really the learning , I think , is around how complicated these supply- side issues\ncan be. We haven ’t seen this before in a long, long time. And so that ’s really , you know, what\naccounts for the pace at which we moved , and we did. W hen inflation changed direction, really,\nin October , we’ve moved quickly since then. I thin k people would agree. But before then,\ninflation was coming down month by month. And , you know, we kind of thought we had the\nstory —probably had the story right. But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of\ndata that said “N o. This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we ’ve been\nthinking. ” And, again, we ’ve pivoted, and here we are.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession. So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the U.S. in a\nrecession? And just remind us , what is your definition for the start of a recession?\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So the Fed doesn’ t make a —doesn’t make a judgment on that. You\nknow, w e’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment\nand price stability. We don ’t—we don’t say “T here is now a recession ” and that kind of thing.\nSo that wouldn’ t be something we ’d do. We would look at the data tomorrow —and no doubt,\nwe’ll look at it very carefully —and draw whatever implications we can.\nAs I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflatio n—sorry, what a\nrecession really is, it ’s a broad- based decline across many industries that , you know, is sustain ed\nfor more than a couple of months , and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And it just\ndoesn’t —this just doesn’ t seem like that now. What we have right now doesn’ t seem like that.\nAnd the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength\nthat it makes you really question the GDP data. But , again, that ’s not a decision that we —that\nwe make. And w e won ’t—we won’t reach a conclusion one way or another on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you very much. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist . You said that some softening in the labor market is needed. Within the F ed, there\nare staff economists who ’ve argue d that N AIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment,\nmight be as high as 5 to 6 percent right now , which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate\nof 3.6. What ’s your assessment of N AIRU? Is that something that came up in discussion with\nthe C ommittee?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the —that the\nnatural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we\nthink it was before. And the reason is there’s —it’ s the usual matching issue , where m atching has\nbecome less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthe big switches in demand from services to goods and all that. So it could be higher. And my\nown instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher. Of course, I would add that we\ndon’t know it. We can never know where these star variables are in real time w ith any\nconfidence. But I would say it must have move d up materiall y.\nBut the other side of that is , as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and\nunemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly. And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation b ecause it ’s\nthat gap— it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the —and the natural rate that really is\nrelevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy w ith the overtight labor\nmarket. So if you were to—you wouldn’ t observe this. It’s an unobservabl e, but you could\nactually be seeing inflationary pressures com ing down if that does happen. And we don’ t—we\ndon’t control that. But that ’s something that, logically , if the pandemic and the disorder in the\nlabor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in\nprinciple, you should see it move back down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeff.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just a question\nabout —hate to keep banging the drum about recession. But most of the polls that we ’re seeing\nnow from the public, people believe that we ’re already in a recession or heading for one—\neconomists, pretty much the same thing. They ’re being told by folks like you and the\nAdministration that we ’re not in a recession, we ’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming\nfrom the same people who told them inflation was transitory , telling them now that we ’re not\nheading for a recession. So wh at would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nconfident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a —to a potential\ndownturn in the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, a ll I’ve really said is I don ’t think it’ s likely that the U .S.\neconomy’ s in a recession now . And I ’ve explained why that is the case. It’s, it’s because you do\nsee a very strong labor market. And I think the public will see that as well. You know, going\nforward, what we ’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, a s I mentioned. We’ve seen the very\nbeginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the —in the tightness of the labor market, but it would\nonly be the beginnings.\nSo, and I mentioned that , that —I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down a nd\nhave a so -called soft landing , by which I mean a landing that doesn’ t require a significant\nincrease, a really significant increase in unemployment. We ’re trying to achieve that. I have\nsaid, on ma ny occasions , that we understand that ’s going to be quite challenging and that it ’s got\nmore challenging over recent months.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker.\nThe FOMC has historically trie d to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has\nhappened so far this year. How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we ’ve seen thus far\nmight increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally ?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean , there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly —\nfor example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so. So we ’ve been known to do that when it ’s the\nappropriate thing to do. And this year, it clearly is. I would say that , given how quickly we ’ve\nmoved, I ’m gratified that while —that, basically , markets have been working. T hey’ve been\norderly. There ’s been some volatility, but that ’s only to be expected.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nFor a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down , which in some —in\nsome sense lowers vulnerabilities. It’s when they ’re really high that you would worry that\nthey’ re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually. Many asset values have come down. I think\nyou’ve got a well -capitalized banking system. I think you have —households are generally in\nabout as strong as financial shape as they ’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the\nmoney that ’s on people ’s balance sheets. So you have a pretty—from a financial stability\nstandpoint , you have a pretty decent picture .\nNow, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don ’t rise to the\nlevel of financial stability concerns. By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things\nthat might undermine the working of the financial system , so big, serious things. That ’s not to\nsay that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t , aren’t suffering , because they are.\nThey ’re suffering from high inflation. They’re going to the —to the grocery store and finding\nthat, in many cases, their p aycheck doesn ’t cover the food they’ re accustomed to buying. We’ re\nseeing actual , you know, real declines in food consumption. And, you know, it’ s very\nconcerning. It’s very unfortunate. And that ’s why we ’re—we’re really committed to bringing\ndown inflation—one of the reasons.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I can\nremember when you held your first news conference , and you vowed to be a very plainspoken\nChairman , and we ’re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well.\nWhat would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflatio n as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this\ncomplicated economic landscape? Thank you.\n\nJuly 27, 202 2 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess the first thing I would say to , to every household is that\nwe know that inflation is too high. We understand how painf ul it is , particularly for people who\nare living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food\nand gas a nd heating their homes and clothing and things like that. We do understand that , that\nthose people suffer the most. Middle -class and better -off people have some resources, where\nthey can absorb these things. But people, many people , don’ t have those resources. So , you\nknow, we —it is our job . It is our institutional role . We are assigned uniquely and\nunconditionall y the obligation of , of providing price stability to the American people. And we ’re\ngoing to use our tools to do that.\nAs I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market\nconditions. We need growth to slow to below potential growth. We don’ t want to —we don’ t\nwant this to be bigger than it needs to be . But, ultimately , if you think about the medium and\nlonger term, price stability is the thing that , that makes the whole economy work. It ’s what\ncan—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren ’t being eaten up by high inflation.\nIf you talk to people —again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—\nthey’ re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation. So it ’s all the more reason why we\nneed to move , move on this. Thank you very much."
