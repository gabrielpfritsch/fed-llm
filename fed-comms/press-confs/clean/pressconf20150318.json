A s you know, the Federal Open M arket Committee\nthis afternoon reaffirmed the c urrent 0 to ¼ percent target ran ge for the federal funds rate. We\nalso updated our forward guidance, indicating that an increase in the target range for the federal\nfunds rate remains unlikely at our next meeting in April. With continued improvement in\neconomic conditions, however, we do not want to rule out the po ssibility that an increase in the\ntarget range could be warranted a t subsequent meetings. Let me emphasize, however, that the\ntiming of the initial increase in the target range will depend on the Committee’s assessment of\nincoming information. Today’s modification of our guidance sho uld not be interpreted to mean\nthat we have decided on the timi ng of that increase. In other words, just because we removed the\nword “patient” from the statem ent doesn’t mean we are going to be impatient. Moreover, even\nafter the initial increase in t he target funds rate, our policy is likely to remain highly\naccommodative to support continued progress toward our objectiv es of maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation. I’ll co me back to today’s policy deci sions in a few moments, but first I\nwould like to review economic de velopments and the outlook, whi ch formed the basis for our\npolicy decisions.\nWe have seen continued progress toward our objective of maximum employment. The\npace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains a veraging nearly 290,000 per\nmonth over the past three months. The unemployment rate was 5. 5 percent in February; that’s\nthree-tenths lower than the late st reading available at the tim e of our December meeting.\nBroader measures of job market conditions—such as those countin g individuals who want and\nare available to work but have not actively searched recently a nd people who are working part\ntime but would rather work full time—have shown similar improve ment. As we noted in our\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nstatement, slack in the labor market continues to diminish. Me anwhile, the labor force\nparticipation rate—the percenta ge of working-age Americans eith er working or seeking work—\nis lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth rema ins sluggish, suggesting that\nsome cyclical weakness persists . So considerable progress clea rly has been achieved, but room\nfor further improvement in the labor market continues.\nWe continue to expect sufficien t underlying strength in economi c growth to support\nongoing improvement in the labor m arket. After averaging about 2½ percent over 2014, growth\nof real gross domestic product a ppears to have slowed in the fi rst quarter of this year, in part\nreflecting a moderation in hous ehold spending. In addition, th e recovery in the housing sector\nremains subdued, and export growth looks to have weakened. Loo king ahead, however, the\nCommittee continues to expect a moderate pace of GDP growth, wi th robust job gains and lower\nenergy prices supporting household spending.\nInflation has declined further below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower\nenergy prices I just mentioned. D eclining import prices have a lso restrained inflation, and in\nlight of the recent appreciation of the dollar, will likely con tinue to do so in the months ahead.\nMy colleagues and I continue to e xpect that as the effects of t hese transitory factors dissipate and\nas the labor market improves fu rther, inflation will move gradu ally back toward our 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term. In making this forecast, we ar e attentive to the low levels of\nmarket-based measures of inflation compensation. In contrast, survey-based measures of longer-\nterm inflation expectations have r emained stable. The Committe e will continue to monitor\ninflation developments carefully.\nThis assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual e conomic projections\nsubmitted for this meeting by the FOMC participants. As always , each participant’s projections\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nare conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy. The unemployment rate\nprojections over the next few y ears and in the longer run are g enerally a bit lower than the\nDecember projections. At the end of this year, the central ten dency for the unemployment rate\nstands at 5 to 5.2 percent, in line with participants’ estimate s of the longer-run normal\nunemployment rate. Committee participants generally see the un employment rate declining a\nlittle further ove r the course of 2016 and 2017. For economic growth, participan ts generally\nreduced their projections since December, with many citing a we aker outlook for net exports.\nNonetheless, the central tende ncy of the growth projections for this year and next, at 2.3 to 2.7\npercent, remains somewhat above estimates of the longer-run nor mal growth rate. Finally,\nFOMC participants project infla tion to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and\nimport prices. The central ten dency of the inflation projectio ns for this year is now below 1\npercent, down noticeably since Dec ember. As the transitory fac tors holding down inflation\nabate, the central tendenc y rebounds to 1.7 to 1.9 percent next year and rises to 1.9 to 2 percent\nin 2017.\nReturning to monetar y policy, as I noted at the outset, the Com mittee reaffirmed its view\nthat the current 0 to ¼ percent targ et range for the federal fu nds rate remains appropriate. But\nwith economic conditions improving, and with further improvemen t expected in the months\nahead, we have again modified our forward guidance. In Decembe r and January, the Committee\njudged that it could be patient in beginning to normalize the s tance of monetary policy. That\nmeant that we considered it unlikely that economic conditions w ould warrant an increase in the\ntarget range for the federal f unds rate for at least the next c ouple of FOMC meeti ngs. While it is\nstill the case that we consider it unlikely that economic condi tions will warrant an increase in the\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\ntarget range at the April meeting, such an increase could be wa rranted at any later meeting,\ndepending on how the economy evolves.\nLet me emphasize again that toda y’s modification of the forward guidance should not be\nread as indicating that the Com mittee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the\ntarget range for the federal f unds rate. In particular, this c hange does not mean that an increase\nwill necessarily occu r in June, although we can’t rule that out . As we noted in our statement, the\ndecision to raise the target range will depend on our assessmen t of realized and expected\nprogress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 perc ent inflation. We continue\nto base that assessment on a wid e range of information, includi ng measures of labor market\nconditions, indicators of inflati on pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial\nand international developments. W e anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range\nfor the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market\nand is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to it s 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term.\nOnce we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—in the\nwords of our statement—“even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent\nlevels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate\nbelow levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.”\nThis guidance is consistent with t he paths for appropriate poli cy reported by FOMC\nparticipants. Compared with the projections made in December, most participants lowered their\npath for the federal funds rat e, consistent with the downward r evisions made to the projections\nfor GDP growth and inflation as well as somewhat lower estimate s of the longer-run normal\nunemployment rate. The median pr ojection for the federal funds rate is just below 2 percent in\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nlate 2016 and rises a bit above 3 pe rcent in late 2017. The me dian projected rate in 2017 remains\nbelow the 3¾ percent or so projec ted by most participants as th e rate’s longer-run value, even\nthough the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that ti me is slightly below that of its\nestimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflat ion is close to our 2 percent\nobjective. Participants provide a number of explanations for t he federal funds rate running\nbelow its normal longer-run level a t that time. These include, in particular, the residual effects of\nthe financial crisis, which are likely to continue to constrain spending and credit availability for\nsome time. I would like to emphasize that these forecasts of t he appropriate path of the federal\nfunds rate are conditional on par ticipants’ individual projecti ons for economic output, inflation,\nand other factors. But our actua l policy actions over time wil l be data dependent. Accordingly,\nif the expansion proves to be mor e vigorous than currently anti cipated and inflation moves\nhigher than expected, then the a ppropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper and higher\ntrajectory; conversely, if conditi ons were to prove weaker, the n the appropriate trajectory would\nbe lower and less steep.\nFinally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities a nd principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities shou ld help maintain accommodative\nfinancial conditions and promot e further progress toward our ob jectives.\nThank you. Now I’d be happy to take your questions. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reute rs. Hi, thank you. So there’s\nbeen this pretty consistent ref erence to expectations of above- trend growth over the last few\nmonths. Now we’re seeing growt h downgraded in the context of v ery explicit references to\ninternational and external c onditions: weak export growth, oil dragging down inflation, and your\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nown comments now on the dollar. S o my question is, doesn’t thi s indicate that the Fed’s facing a\ntougher time—you know, kind of going it alone, decoupling from the rest of the world—than\nperhaps you expected last fall wh en this first started to be an issue?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaini ng to the first quarter,\nthat real GDP growth has decline d somewhat below where it was f or the last several quarters of\nlast year. And that’s really why t he Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.\nThere has been a slight downgrad ing of estimates of growth for this year. You mentioned the\ndollar. We noted that export gr owth has weakened. Probably th e strong dollar is one reason for\nthat.\nOn the other hand, the strength of the dollar also, in part, re flects the strength of the U.S.\neconomy. The strength of the dolla r is also one factor that, a s I noted, is holding down import\nprices and, at least on a transit ory basis at this point, pushi ng inflation down. So, we are taking\naccount of international developm ents, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in\nmaking the forecast we have here.\nNevertheless, it is important t o recognize that this is not a w eak forecast. Taking\neverything into account, we continue to project above-trend gro wth. We continue to project\nimprovement in the labor market by the end of 2015. The centra l tendency of the participants is,\nthey’re looking for an unemploym ent rate that will be down to 5 .0 to 5.2, which is consistent\nwith their estimates of its l onger-run normal value. So, we do see considerable underlying\nstrength in the U.S. econom y. And, in spite of what looks like a weaker first quarter, we are\nprojecting good performance for the economy.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Cruts inger, Associated Press. The po licy statement\ntoday talks about one of the prere quisites you’ll need to start raising rates is to be “reasonably\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nconfident” that inflation—your i nflation target—will be met at 2 percent, but that is coming out\nat a time when you’ve lowere d your forecast on inflation, what— which I would think would\nmake you less confident about it . What is it go ing to take to make you “reasonably confident”\nabout inflation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I don’t have a mechanical answer for you. T here is no single\nthing where I’d say, “We must s ee such-and-such in order to ach ieve that level of confidence.”\nWe will be looking at a wi de array of data.\nNow, we’ve said that we also wan t to see continued improvement in the labor market.\nAnd a stronger labor market wit h less labor market slack is one factor that would tend to,\ncertainly for me, increase my con fidence that as slack diminish es, that inflation will move up\nover time. Other things I will be looking at—of course, the in flation data, but as we said, we\nexpect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines\nand the dollar. But we will be looking at the inflation data c arefully to see if w e can interpret, for\nexample, low levels of inflati on—if we see that, which we expec t, as reflecting those influences.\nWe will be looking at wage growth. We have not seen wage growt h pick up. We may\nnot see wage growth pick up, I woul dn’t say either that that is a precondition to raising rates.\nBut if we did see wage growth pi ck up, that would be at least a symptom that inflation would\nlikely move up over time.\nWe’ll be watching inflation expe ctations. Survey measures have been stable; I expect\nthat to continue, but we will be watching it carefully. And ma rket-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have fallen. They’re low. If they were to move u p over time, that would probably\nserve to increase my confidence.\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nBut there are a wide range of t hings that we will be looking at , including further\nimprovement in the labor market . So there’s no simple answer. This is a judgment that the\nCommittee will have to make.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon H ilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, the\nfamous dot plot that we always ta lk about showed that officials ’ expectations for where interest\nrates are going to end the y ear in 2015, ’16, and ’17 have come down fairly notably. I wonder if\nyou could explain to us your analy sis of why those estimates ar e coming down. And,\nspecifically, is it a reflecti on of—what’s changed? And is it a reflection of the changes in the\nFed’s economic forecast or a cha nge in the way the Fed is react ing to the economy that it sees—\nits reaction function?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, it’s always hard to know exactly why each pa rticipant has written\ndown the forecast they have, but certainly there are changes in the assessments of the economy\nand forecasts for the economy tha t would point in the direction of downward adjustment in the\nfunds rate path. For one thi ng, you do see meaningful downward adjustment in the inflation\nforecast, certainly for this year.\nIn addition, importantly, a numbe r of participants have marked down their estimates of\nthe normal longer-run unemploymen t rate. So that range has mov ed down noticeably from—\npreviously it was 5.2 to 5.5, and i t’s now moved down to 5.0 to 5.2. And downward revisions to\nthe longer-run normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more\nslack in the economy now than the y previously did. So I think both of those things would point\nto downward revision in the funds rate path.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . The experience of some\nother central banks—notably Japa n, Sweden also—suggests that ti ghtening earl y when you’re at\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nthe zero lower bound can be a risky process—the ri sks of tighte ning early can dramatically\noutweigh the risks of leaving thi ngs a little l onger. I wonder if you could comment on that\ninternational experience and expl ain how that’s influencing the debate in the FOMC at the\nmoment.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, when an econom y is operating at the so-cal led zero lower\nbound, there—it creates a situation w here there are asymmetric risks. It is possible, if the\neconomy proves stronger than is expected, to r espond to that by tightening policy. If there are\nadverse shocks to demand that tend to push infla tion and econom ic performance in an adverse\ndirection, it’s not possible to l ower rates. Of course, that’s a reason why, for a number of years,\nwe engaged in active asset purch ase programs. So there is a si tuation there of asymmetric risks,\nand it does point in the direct ion of waiting longer to raise r ates.\nBut I would say that this is a n influence that we—and a set of considerations—that we\nhave long been aware of and have been taking into account, so t hat it’s not some thing that just\ncomes into play now. It is a reas on that we have held our rate s at 0 to ¼ percent for, now,\nroughly six years. So, we are see ing an economy that’s growing above trend, the labor market is\nimproving. I think some of the h eadwinds that have long been h olding the economy back are\nbeginning to recede, which is a reason that the Committee wants to be able to evaluate incoming\ndata and consider when it may be appropriate to finally raise r ates. But that is a consideration we\nhave long taken into account.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesma n, CNBC. I don’t hear, Chair Yelle n, any quantitative\nmeasures of what increasing conf idence is in inflation or headi ng back towards—or a further\nimprovement in the job market, which is unusual for a Fed that not too long ago was providing\nus metrics on unemployment about when it would move with rates. Is it now policy to keep the\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nmarket guessing? And is it thoug ht that you’d have better poli cy and economic outcomes from\nless certainty about the path of interest rates? And a kind of related question, if you will: Could\nyou see raising rates while the C ommittee still judges that the risks are balanced?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, in terms of cer tainty and providing metrics, we provided a metric\nor a threshold of 6½ percent severa l years ago and told market participants and the public that we\nwouldn’t consider it appropriate to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than\nthat level, as long as inflati on was well contained. But our p olicy needs to be data dependent,\nand we need to respond to incom ing data and our assessment of i ncoming data in terms of where\nwe think the economy is heading a nd how close we are to our obj ectives.\nAnd the markets—so, can we provide certainty? Of course we can ’t provide certainty\nbecause we’re not certain what th e data will look like and how the economy will evolve. And to\nachieve our objectives, we need t o watch the data, continually reformulate our best guesses—our\nforecasts of where the econo my is going—and respond appropriate ly. And we can’t provide\ncertainty and shouldn’t provide c ertainty because economic deve lopments that will unfold are\nuncertain. And what market par ticipants should be doing is loo king at incoming data just as we\nare and forming their expectati ons for where policy will be goi ng and should be going just\nexactly as we will be doing by a ttempting to understand economi c developments as they unfold.\nAnd that’s—that is what we’re t rying to say in this statement, that that’s what we will be doing\ngoing forward. And we don’t want to—and don’t think it’s appro priate at this point—to provide\ncalendar-based guidance.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can I have the second part about the balance of risks—would you\nraise rates when risks are balanced?\nCHAIR YELLEN. The risks to what?\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If risks are ba lanced, as they say in the state ment, could you be\nraising rates in that context?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I guess we s aid the risks to the outlook a re balanced. And, I\nmean, certainly we could raise r ates in a situati on where the r isks are balanced. We need to see,\nas we have said, we want to see fu rther improvement in the labo r market, and we want to feel\nreasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent\ninflation objective.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times . There seems to be an\nawful lot riding on surveys of i nflation expectations, yet thos e surveys are an imprecise\ninstrument; they don’t seem partic ularly sensiti ve to the types of changes in inflation that we\nhave seen in recent years, they don’t seem to differentiate bet ween, say, 1.5 and 2—the\nexpectations remain stable ev en through those changes. Could y ou talk a little bit about why the\nFOMC has confidence that those me asures are accurate reflection s of where inflation is likely to\ngo and whether, you know, the concerns that you’ve articulated about market-based measures at\nall correspond to concerns that you may have about survey-based measures?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, survey-base d measures aren’t perfect. And the mean—often\nthe mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation,\nso they seem to be biased. Nev ertheless, they do seem to be us eful in predicting actual\nmovements in inflation. And because we think inflation expecta tions are a determinant of price\nsetting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, ev en if it’s imperfect, in trying to\ngauge inflation expectations. And so we do look at survey meas ures.\nNow, the fact that survey measur es are stable, even if they are stable at levels consistent\nwith inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve, that’s not a guarantee that inflation\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nwill, over time, move to be consis tent with those expectations. An example is Japan, I would\ngive you, where for many years th e households and businesses ex pected positive inflation but\nthere was a consistent undershoot . So, this isn’t a single met ric that is perf ect, but it’s one of\nmany things we’d look at.\nWe also look at measures of inf lation expectations based on mar ket differentials between\nnominal and real or TIPS yields . They’re also informative but can move around for reasons\npertaining to liquidity in the Tr easury market and in the TIPS market, and also because of\nchanging perceptions of inflati on risk. So, they’re not a pure read, either. And we want to look\nat both things and not take aw ay any simple morals.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fo x Business. Chair Yellen, I wan ted to check in again\nwith you on whether or not you see or have any concerns about b ubbles out there in the\neconomy, particularly the financi al markets—debt and equity mar kets. And I wanted to refer to\nyour most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress last month, in which you said “overall\nequity valuations by some conventional measures are somewhat hi gher than their historical\nlevels . . . valuation metrics in some sectors continued to app ear stretched rela tive to historical\nnorms.” In the same report last year, in July, the report spec ifically mentioned biotech and social\nmedia stocks as being “substantia lly”—let me see here—“substant ially stretched.” Do you still\nfeel that way and can you co mment on bubbles and particularly t hese sectors?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I don’t want to comment on those particula r sectors. You\nknow, as we said in the report, overall measures of equity valu ations are on the high side but not\noutside of historical ranges. In s ome corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually\nlow spreads, and that’s what was referred to i n the report.\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nMore broadly, we do try to assess pot ential threats to financia l stability. And in addition\nto looking at asset valuations, w e also look at measures of cre dit growth, of the extent of\nleverage being used in the econom y and in the financial sector, and the extent of maturity\ntransformation. And taking into account a broad range of metri cs that bear on financial stability,\nour overall assessment at this poi nt is that threats are modera te.\nJENNIFER LIBERTO. Jen Liberto, Politico . So, I want to switch ge ars a little bit and\nask about some of the tension be tween the Fed and Congress late ly, with some lawmakers calling\nfor more transparency and acc ountability measures. And I wante d to ask to what degree that\nthere might be room for the Fed to consider some of these measu res, like maybe a rules-based\napproach like the Taylor rule, or some of these measures that w ould change up who has a voting\nseat on the FOMC. To what degree does that make it more diffic ult to accomplish your mission?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I believe the Federal Reserve is already one of the most\ntransparent central banks of any around the globe. We provide an immense amount of\ninformation, both financial—about our balance sheet—and our mon etary policy operations. We\nhave audited financial statem ents. We publish our balance shee t every week. If you want to\nknow exactly what’s in the SOM A portfolio, it’s listed on the N ew York Fed website on a\nCUSIP-by-CUSIP basis. I have pre ss conferences. We issue minu tes. We have, you know,\nstatements that we release right after meetings and transcripts within five years. So, if you put\nall that together, we are a transparent central bank.\nWith respect to congressional cha nges that are under considerat ion that would politicize\nmonetary policy by bring ing Congress in to make policy judgment s about, in real-time, on our\nmonetary policy decisions. C ongress itself decided in 1978 tha t that was a bad t hing to do, that it\nwould lead to poor economic perfor mance, and they carved out th is one area of policy reviews,\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nof monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits. The GAO lo oks at everything else that\ngoes on within the Fed. And I thi nk that that is a central ban k best practice.\nThe global experience shows th at giving central banks independe nce to make monetary\npolicy decisions that th ey think are in the be st interest of th e country and consistent with their\nmandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic outcomes. So, I feel very\nstrongly about that, but we are accountable to Congress. Of co urse, we’re ready to provide\ninformation that Congress needs t o evaluate the Fed’s decisionm aking, in monetary policy and\nelsewhere.\nWith respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and\nlong have—as a kind of benchmark f or thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of\npolicy. But to chain a central ba nk to follow a simple mathema tical rule that fai ls to take account\nof many things that are very im portant in making monetary polic y—for example, I was earlier\nasked about being against the z ero lower bound, which is an imp ortant special consideration—\nthat would be a very foolis h thing to do, and I oppose it.\nWith respect to proposals havi ng to do with voting and the stru cture of the Fed that you\nmentioned, a lot of ideas have been mentioned. I would say, fo r my part, I think the Federal\nReserve works well. The syste m we have was put into place by C ongress decades ago. I don’t\nthink it’s a system that’s br oken. Of course, Congress can rev isit the decisions it’s made about\nthe structure of the Fed. The re were good reasons for making t he decisions that were made about\nhow to structure voting and other things, but—and I don’t think the system is broken, I think it’s\nworking well. So I don’t see a need for changes. But, of cour se, it’s up to Congress to review\nthat.\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nSTEVEN MUFSON. I was wondering w hether you could quantify the effect that the\nstronger dollar has had on econom ic output so far this year; th e extent to which it’s sort of acted\nas its own rate increase; and w hat sort of obligation you feel, if any, to make life easier for the\nECB, Bank of Japan, and the many emerging market countries that are struggling with some of\nthe issues we struggle d with not that long ago.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, with respect t o the impact of the dollar on the U.S. economy, I\ndon’t have a quantitative estimat e to offer you, but I certainl y expect net exports to serve as a\nnotable drag, this year, on the outlook. But, remember, we hav e to put that in context: There are\na lot of things that affect t he U.S. outlook, and while that is serving as a drag on economic\ngrowth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient stren gth—particularly in private\nspending—that we are expecti ng above-trend growth, even so.\nWith respect to our neighbors, we look very carefully at what’s happening in the global\nenvironment. We realize that ou r own policies affect performan ce in the rest of the world, and\nthat performance in other count ries has an influence on us, so we spend a good deal of time\ndiscussing global developments . It is important for us to keep our own house in order, to put in\nplace the policy that’s consistent with the objectives that Con gress has given us, and I think a\nstrong U.S. economy certainly i s something that is good for oth er countries as well. We have\npledged to communicate as clearly as we can about monetary poli cy, and I am trying to do that,\nand will continue to do so.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER . Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. We\ntalked about the risk of tighten ing too early. What about the risk of waiting too long, especially\nsince it can take a while for Fe d actions to work their way thr ough the economy?\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I agree with that. Many, many studies over decades and\ndecades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary pol icy affects the economy, and,\ntherefore, monetary policy does have to be forward looking. Th at’s why we spend so much time\npreparing forecasts and discussi ng them, and we want to put in place a policy that will be\nappropriate for where the econom y is heading. That’s—that is, you know, a reason that many of\nmy colleagues—most of my colleag ues—are anticipating that it wi ll be appropriate to begin to\ntighten policy sometime this year . In spite of the fact that t hey are projecting tha t inflation will\nbe low, they’re looking forwar d and they see that, by the end o f 2016 or 2017, with the labor\nmarket recovering, and assuming tha t inflation expectations rem ain stable and transitory\ninfluences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation he ading back to our 2 percent\nobjective. So just as we don’t wa nt to be premature in tighten ing policy and aborting a recovery\nthat we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also don’t want to be behind\nthe curve in beginning to tighten given those lags.\nCRAIG TORRES. Madame Chair, I’d like to preface this by saying , I do believe you\nstand for accountability. And—so, recently, a bunch of us, we’ re in a room over there, there was\na police guard outside, and your sta ff had taken our cell phone s, and they controlle d the Internet\nin the room—all this to guard the security of the FOMC statemen t. If one of us had leaked it, we\nwould lose our jobs. Surely the re would be a prosecution, and my friends here in the press\nwould certainly have a ba nner day with that story.\nThere was a leak in the FOMC . We don’t know what happened. I’ ve asked, I can’t get\nan answer. And now Congress is asking. Both par ties want to k now. I’m not going to ask about\nthe IG’s probe—I understand that’ s an active case now, suddenly , after two years of just sitting\nthere. But I would like to as k what you’ve found at the Board. You weren’t Chairman then, you\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nwere Vice Chair, I believe. S o what answers do you have, and a re you going to respond to\nCongress?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, let me say tha t the Committee and I, persona lly, take very\nseriously our responsibility to s afeguard confidential informat ion. We have a set of policies and\nprocedures that are in place that we’re to follow if we believe that there have been leaks of\nconfidential information. And thi s is something that doesn’t o ccur very often, but if it does\noccur, we follow those procedures. It has been reported that o ur Inspector General is engaged in\na review at this time of thi s matter, and in light of that ongo ing review, I’m not going to get into\ndetails, but let me just say tha t we welcome that review and ar e looking forward to its\nconclusions. With respect to C ongress, congressional inquiries —we have arranged to brief\nmembers of Congress who’ve ask ed about this, and we’ll certainl y cooperate in trying to provide\nthem the information that they seek.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Madame Chair, thanks for taking my question. Th e banking sector\nhas clearly improved since the cr isis in terms of capital reten tion, but there’s also seemingly a\nnumber of scandals involving for ex manipulation, of course LIBO R. Do you think that the\nculture at the banks is wher e it ought to be? And, if not, wha t is the Fed going to do to improve\nit, and when?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, it’s certai nly been—I mean, it’s certainly been very\ndisappointing to see what have been some really brazen violatio ns of the law, and we absolutely\nexpect the banks that we superv ise to comply with the law and t o have in place controls that\nensure compliance in organiza tions. And while changing the cul ture of organizations is not\nsomething that we can achieve through supervision, we will make sure that the banks that we\nsupervise have appropriate comp liance regimes in place. And to the extent that compensation\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nschemes might be incenting such b ehavior that inappropriately r ewards risk-taking, that’s\nsomething that was—we will, you know, look for in our supervisi on as well.\nJOHN HELTMAN. I have a follow-up. When you introduced—you int roduced a\ncompensation rule in 2011. Wh en do you think we might see some movement on that—on that\nrule?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, the agencies— the agencies are working join tly to bring out a\nrule on this, but we do have supe rvisory policies in place conc erning the structure of incentive\npay and compensation, and our superv ision covers that topic now . And we have seen, I think,\nmeaningful changes already in the structure of compensation and banking organizations to\ndiminish ways in which it might incent risk-taking.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires. I gu ess I have two\nfollow-ups, one with regard to Cra ig’s question. So, before th e IG’s investigation, according to\nRepublican Congressman Hensarlin g’s letter to your office, he s ays that, “It is my understanding\nthat although the Federal Reserve ’s General Counsel was initial ly involved in this investigation,\nthe inquiry was dropped at the r equest of several members of th e FOMC.” Now, that predates\nthe IG. I want to know if you coul d tell us who are these memb ers of the FOMC who struck\ndown this investigation? And doe sn’t not revealing these facts kind of go directly against the\nsort of transparency and account ability that you’re trying to b ring to the central bank?\nCHAIR YELLEN. That is an allega tion that I don’t believe has a ny basis in fact. I’m not\ngoing to go into the details, but I don’t know where that piece of information could possibly have\ncome from.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. If I could follow up on his question. I think when you get asked\nabout financial crimes and t he public hears you talk about comp liance, you get a sense that\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nthere’s not enough enforcement i nvolved in these actions, and t hat it’s merely a case of kind of\ntrying to achieve settlements a fter the fact. Is there a sense in the regulatory community that\nfinancial crimes need to be punished sort of more forcefully in order for them to be—for there to\nbe an actual deterrent agai nst unethical behavior?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, the—you’re tal king about within banking orga nizations? So, the\nfocus of regulators—the banki ng regulators—is safety and soundn ess, and what we want to see\nis changes made as rapidly as pos sible that will eliminate prac tices that are unsafe and unsound.\nWe can’t—only the Justice Depart ment can bring criminal action, and they have taken up cases\nwhere they think that that’s app ropriate. In some situations, when we are able to identify\nindividuals who were responsib le for misdeeds, we can put in pl ace prohibitions that bar them\nfrom participating in banking, a nd we have done so and will con tinue to do so.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner of MNI. Good afternoon, Madame C hair. The\nFOMC said last September that it will wait ‘til after the first rate hike to stop or to discontinue\nreinvesting proceeds of its MBS holdings and stop rolling over maturing Treasurie s. What is the\nFOMC’s current thinking about how long after liftoff you should wait to stop reinvestments and\nrollovers? And, given the very lar ge amounts of Treasuries mat uring next year, would it make\nsense for the FOMC to vary the pace of runoff that it allows?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, we issued in Se ptember a set of normalizatio n principles, and, as\nyou noted, the Committee indicated t hat we will eventually ceas e reinvestments or diminish the\npace of reinvestments as a way of gradually reducing the size o f our portfolio over time. We\nsaid we would do that when econom ic conditions were appropriate after we begin raising rates,\nbecause we want changes in the—our target range for the federal funds rate to be the main tool\nby which we shift the stance of monetary policy. We’ve not made any deci sion at this point\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nabout how long it will be, once we b egin to raise rates, before we reduce or cease reinvestment.\nWe will see how things go, and the Committee will revisit that and make a decision at a later\ntime.\nYou also indicated that we have a substantial quantity of Treas uries that will roll off our\nbalance sheet over the next sev eral years. That’s true, and th at will—I think, over the next two\nyears, almost $800 billion will matu re—and that they will be sh ort-term, obviously, Treasuries at\nthat point, and that’s a way in whi ch we anticipate diminishing the size of our portfolio.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Can I follow up, please? Some people have sugg ested that you\nmight need to manage those runoffs a little more granularly, if that’s a word, perhaps pursue a\ndifferent track for Treasur ies versus MBS or, you know, at give n quarters when you have very\nlarge amounts maturing, and there might be a spike in long-term interest rates, that maybe you\nwould vary the rate of runoff. I s that—any consideration given to that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. That’s something for which we’ve made no plans, and I don’t really\nhave anything for you on that.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from Mark etWatch. We hear that productiv ity takes a long\ntime before you can understand it, b ut it’s been very low in th is cycle. What does that mean for\nFed policy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I agree, it has been very low—it’s been di sappointingly low. A\npositive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is th at the labor market has improved\nmore rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of ec onomic growth. So the\nunemployment rate has come down m ore rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor\nmarket has improved more rapidly than I would have expected. W e have written down our\nestimates of potential output . In the long run, it is a disapp ointing factor about the ultimate\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nprospects for the U.S. econom y if it continues. I would expect it to pick up, and as you can see\nfrom the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above\ncurrent levels. But it means it’s something that would, if it persists, retard living standards and\nwould likely retard real wage gr owth and improvement in living standards for ordinary\nhouseholds.\nPETER COOK. Peter Cook of Bloombe rg Television. Madame Chair, one clarification,\nif I could, logistically, and t hen a question about Congress, a follow-up. First of all, you’ve been\nasked this before, I just want t o see if we can clarify. When you decide to start raising interest\nrates, could that decision ha ppen at a meeting in which you—it’ s not followed by a press\nconference? And, on my congressi onal question, I would like to get your reaction to your—the\ntreatment you received up on Capito l Hill the other day. It di dn’t look like a very pleasant\nexperience, certainly in front of the House, at least at moment s. I wondered if you have concerns\nabout that. Has the relations hip between the Fed and Congress deteriorated to a point that it\ncauses you concern? What, if anything, can you do about it as well?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start w ith the press conferences. I s aid this previously, and\nlet me reiterate it, that ever y meeting that the Federal Open M arket Committee has is a live\nmeeting at which we could make a decision. Clearly, if we deci ded for the first time to raise the\nfederal funds rate, it is som ething—I think it would be appropr iate to answer questions and\nexplain in more detail. We ha ve long had the capacity to call a press conference after a meeting\nthat we would hold by teleconfer ence—by conference call—and tha t’s a capacity that was used\non a number of occasions by my predecessor during the financial crisis. It is something that\nremains a capacity we have and w ould expect to use if it were n ecessary.\n\nMarch 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference \n\nOn the second part of your question , with respect to testimony, you know, it’s very\nimportant for the Federal Reser ve to be accountable to Congress . We have a wide range of\nresponsibilities, and it’s entirely appropr iate for me to testi fy and be quizzed on a range of topics\nby members of Congress. I—you know , I think I need to be ready to answer questions on any\naspect of Federal Reserve behavi or, and that’s an important pri nciple."
