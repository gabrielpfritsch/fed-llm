  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made good progress toward our dual -mandate objectives. Inflation has eased\nfrom its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That’ s very good news. But\ninflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to\nreturning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditi ons that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Over the past two years, we ’ve significantly tightened the stance\nof monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we ’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness\nhas eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy —\nabout monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as im proving supply\nconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.\n\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a\npace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers . The labor force participation rate has moved up , on balance , over the past year,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years , and immigration has returned to pre -pandemic\nlevels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of\n2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding\nthe volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent . The lower inflation\nreadings over the second half of last year are welcome . But we will need to see continuing\nevidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer -\nterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nOver the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and\nwe’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of\n\nmonetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The\nCommittee decided at today ’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the\neconomy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surpris ed forecasters in many ways since\nthe pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We ’re prepared\nto maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.\nAs labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal o f the progress we ’ve\nseen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At\nthe same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic\nactivity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target\nrange until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer -run— longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\n\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to our questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’ t\nwant to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming —coming down\nfully. I wonder —what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? And as you\nmake those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you ’ve been seeing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry —say that last part again.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. How are —how are you weighing the growth data and\nconsumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let\nme say that we have confidence. We ’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is\nmoving sustainably down to 2 percent. Implicitly, we do have confidence , and it has been\nincreasing, but we want to get greater confidence . What do we want to see? We want to see\nmore good data. It ’s not that we ’re looking for better data. It’s—we’re looking at continuation\nof the good data that we ’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation. So we have six months\nof good inflation data. The question really is, that six months of good inflation data —is it\nsending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation? That ’s the question. And the answer will come from some more data that ’s also good\n\ndata. It doesn’t —it’s not that the six -month data isn’ t—isn’t low enough. It is. It’s just a\nquestion of, can we take that with confidence that we ’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?\nThat’s really what we’ re thinking about.\nIn terms of, of growth, we ’ve had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we ’ve\nhad strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year —going right into the fourth\nquarter. And yet we ’ve had a very strong labor market, and we ’ve had inflation coming down.\nSo I think —whereas a year ago , we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in\neconomic activity—that hasn’ t been the case. So I think we , we look at —we look at stronger\ngrowth. We don’ t look at it as a problem. I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.\nWe want to see a strong labor market. We’ re not looking for a weaker labor market. We’re\nlooking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six\nmonths.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. And I ’m sorry . If I could just follow up very quickly, the —when ,\nwhen you say that you want to make sure that it ’s a true signal, is there anything that you ’re\nseeing in the data that makes you doubt that it ’s a true signal at this stage?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think it’s —I, I would say it, it seems —it seems to be the likely\ncase that , that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven ’t yet.\nAnd so—I mean, it ’s a good story. We have six months of good inflation [readings] . But you\ncan—and you know this —you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it ’s\nbeen coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative. It ’s a reasonable assumption that , over time , goods inflation will flatten out —probably\napproximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in\nother words, what we care about is the aggregate number —not so much the composition. But\n\nwe, we just need to see more. That ’s where we are, as a Committee. We need to see more\nevidence that sort of confirms what we think we ’re seeing and that tells us that we are on —gives\nus confidence that we ’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, it seems to\nme you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons. One was the risk of a wage–\nprice spiral. Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. This\nmorning ’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private -sector payroll growth running at a\nsub–4 percent pace. Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation\nemergency of the last three years. And , given that you appear to have substantially cut off these\ntwo tail risks and that you ’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory,\nwhat good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent? Are you really going to learn\nmore waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, almost every participant on the C ommittee does\nbelieve that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for —partly for the reasons that you say.\nYou know, we, w e feel like inflation is coming down. Growth has been strong. The labor\nmarket is strong. We’re —what we ’re trying to do is identify a place where we ’re really\nconfident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level. So, overall, I thi nk—I think people do believe —and , as you\nknow, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year. But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could ask differently : If, if you hold rates high as inflation\nmoderates, as it —as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its\nvariants . What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by\nthose rules in the current instance?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor\nrules and , and non- Taylor kind of rules. We consult them regularly. They ’re in our , our\nTealbook, and, and they ’re in all the materials that we look at. But, you know, I don’ t think\nwe’ve ever been at a— at a place where we were —where we were setting policy by them. And\nthere —depending on the rule, it will tell you different things. There are many different\nformulations. Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates\ngo up if —holding all else equal —as inflation comes down. But that doesn ’t mean we can\nmechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry —as inflation comes down. It doesn ’t mean that\nat all , because, for one thing, we , we don’t know —we, we look at more than just the fed funds\nrate. We look at —broadly—financial conditions.\nBut, in addition, we don’ t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is\nat any given time. But that also doesn’ t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the\neconomy turn down, because that would be too late. So we ’re really in a risk -management\nmode : of managing the risk —as I mentioned in my opening remarks —managing the risk that we\nmove too soon and move too late. And I think to move, which is —which is where almost\neveryone on the C ommittee is —is in favor of , of moving rates down this year —but the timing of\nthat is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. I ’d like you to, to key in on the\nuse of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “ remains elevated. ” You’ve pledged to cut\nrates before inflation reached 2 percent. So that implies that there ’s some sort of intermediate\nstep here on , on inflation and that a , a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement\nlanguage that inflation “remains elevated. ” What ’s the step -down from there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I , I don’ t know that we ’ve worked out the particular s—\nstatement language and that kind of thing. I would just say, if you look at —you know, look at\nwhere , where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it ’s still well above —core is 2.9 percent,\nfor example —12- month —which is way down from where it was. Very, very positive\ndevelopment —very fast decline—a nd, and, you know, the , the case is likely that it will continue\nto come down. So , so that ’s where —that ’s where it is. But we’re , you know, we ’re wanting to\nsee, you know, more data.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So , if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows\nthat you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’ t mention the\nother side of the mandate —a slide in employment. Would a slide in employment also bring you\nto the point of , of cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So let me say that we’ re not looking for that. That ’s not\nsomething we ’re looking for. But , yes, if you think about, you know —in, in the base case, the\neconomy is performing well —the labor market remains strong. If we saw an unexpected\nweakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.\nAbsolutely. And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things —would\nargue for moving later. In the base case, though, where , where the economy is healthy and we\nhave, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth —we have a strong labor market —we\n\nhave inflation coming down—t hat’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around.\nAnd in that case, what we ’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage\nof that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Just to circle back to the “ greater\nconfidence ” aspect of the statement, there’ s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings. I ’m just\nwondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is the re unanimity\nor, at least , consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater\nconfidence is? And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you\nknow, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “ greater confidence ”\nthreshold could be reached? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re not —we’re not really at that stage. You know, we’re —\nwe’re —there was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did, you know, talk about their view of\nthe rate path. I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as , as, you know, as good evidence\nof where people are, although it is —it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later. So , you know,\nwe’re not —we’re not at a place of , of really working out those kinds of details, because we\nweren ’t actively considering, you know, a —moving, moving the federal funds rate down. I will\nsay, there is a—there is a wide disparity —a healthy disparity —of views, and you see that in\npublic , public statements , in the minutes , and the transcripts when they’ re released every five\nyears. So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that ’s actually essential for making\ngood policy. We’ re also able to reach agreement , generally , because we listen to each other —\n\nwe, we compromise . And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’ re able to —for the\nmost part— able to join in. To me, that ’s a well -functioning public institution.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. So , over the past few years, there have been all these real -time\nindicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like\nOpenT able data or office attendance. You ’ve talked about vacancies in the past. And I ’m\nwondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that ’s giving you the\nclearest picture of the economy —including on rents —if you could touch on that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Including?\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Rent. Rent costs.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. Well , so we’re not —you know, it ’s not the pandemic, so we\ncan actually rely on more , more traditional forms. People are working. T hey’re getting wages,\nand, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn’ t say we ’re looking at that , that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you\npoint to rent s. So, of course, we follow the , the components of inflation very carefully. W hich\nwould be : Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit ; you mentioned housing inflation. So\nthe question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents , as\nmeasured, measured in PCE inflation?\nAnd we think that ’s coming, and we know it ’s coming. It ’s just a question of when and,\nand how big it ’ll be. So —but that’s in, in everyone ’s forecast, I would say. So that will —that\nwill help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably— it’s been giving a lot of\ndisinflation to the effort —and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some , some\n\nmore time to run. You know, the se—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they\nwere. In addition, it takes time for the , the healing process to get into prices. So there may be\nstill a tailwind. We’ ll find out with, with that. So we look at the things that relate to our\nmandate very carefully , and—as you would imagine.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I guess , just as a quick follow -up—do you feel comfortable at this\npoint saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more\nconfidence?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t say we’ ve achieved that. And I , I think\nwe have —we have a ways to go. Inflation is still —you know, core inflation is still well above\ntarget on a 12- month basis. Twelve months is our , our target, certainly. I’m encouraged, and\nwe’re encouraged by the progress. But, you know, we ’re, we’re not —we’re not declaring\nvictory at all at this point. We think we have a ways to go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You ’ve said that you would know the\nneutral rate by its works. So I ’m wondering what you could tell me —how do you believe the\nneutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger? In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s —I think you, you do see in the interest -sensitive parts of the\neconomy— you do see, for example, housing. You see the effects. You do. Your , your second\nquestion, though, really, I think, is important, and that is , a lot of this has come through—a lot of\nthe disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you’ ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other\n\ncycles and has brought that working with tighter , tighter policy, which has enabled the supply\nside to recover —I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So, no—we\nreally do think that we ’re having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the\ninterest -sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it ’s a—it’s a joint\nstory. It ’s a complicated story.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But , but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the\neconomy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s —so I think it’s, it’s —of course , you know that it ’s not something\nyou can identify with any precision. But if you— a standard approach would be to take the\nnominal rate —5.3 percent, let ’s say —and subtract sort of a , a forward measure of inflation. If\nyou do that —and there are many, many ways to calculate th e neutral rate —but that ’s one I like\nto do. And , you know, you’ re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream\nestimates of neutrality —of the neutral rate —you will. And —but at the same time, you look at\nthe economy, and you say, “T his is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. ” And , and you\nsay, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate? ” What ’s happening, though, is , the supply\nside has been recovering in the middle of this. So that , that won ’t go on forever. So a lot of the\ngrowth we ’re seeing is not —is—it isn ’t just a tug of war between , between interest rates and\ndemand. You ’re getting , you know, more activity because of the —of labor market healing and\nsupply chains healing. So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the , the, you\nknow, the, the restriction will show up probably more , more sharply.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rich.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you—sorry. Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.\nYou mentioned earlier we ’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said. Can you\n\ntalk a little bit more about that? Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote,\nunquote, “ normal” and that the —we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming\nback down to what they were pre -pandemic? Even with today’ s ECI levels, they were still above\nthose pre -pandemic levels.\nCHAIR POWELL. I , I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing\nnormal —but not totally back to normal. And you pointed to one or more of them. So I think,\nyou know, job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages —wage increases, rather,\nare not quite back to where they— to where they would need to be in the longer run. I , I would\nlook at it this way, though. The , the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.\nAnd that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens —it’s,\nit’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that ’s okay.\nThat’s okay. But we do see —you saw today’ s ECI reading —you know, the evidence is that , that\nwage increases are still at a healthy level —very healthy level —but they’ re gradually moving\nback to levels that would be more associated —given, given assumptions about productivity, are\nmore typically associated with 2 percent inflation. It’s, it’s an ongoing process —a healthy one —\nand, and, you know, I think we ’re, we’re moving in the right direction.\nRICH MILLER. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market,\nbasically, you’ re saying?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the , the labor market is —it— I don’t know if I’d —it’s\nrebalancing. Clearly , that the —there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers\nand supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the\nbeginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage , and it was just —it\n\nwas everywhere —panic on the part of businesses —couldn’ t, couldn’t find people. So , what ’s\nhappened is —we expected labor —the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it\ndidn’ t. And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well,\nmaybe we won’ t get it back. ” And then 2023, we did, as you know —so labor force participation\ncame back strongly in ’ 23, and so did immigration. Immigration came to a halt during the\npandemic.\nSo—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor\nmarket to what is still a very strong labor market. It’ s still a good labor market for wages and for\nfinding a job, but it ’s getting back into balance , and that ’s what we want to see. And , you know,\none great way to look at that is what ’s happening with, with wage increases. And you see it now\nacross the, the major things that we —that we track. It isn ’t every quarter, but , overall , there ’s a\nclear trend —still at high levels, but back down to where —what would be consistent with, with\nwhere we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. I\nwanted to follow up on Rich’ s question. It sounded like you suggested that you’ re not worried\nabout faster growth so much—s o wanted to see if you’ re seeing anything that suggests that\ninflation could reaccelerate from here . And it sounds like you ’re saying you’ re not worried that\nsolid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think that that is a risk —the risk that inflation would , would\nreaccelerate. I think the , the greater risk is that it would —that it would stabilize at a level\nmeaningfully above 2 percent. That ’s, that’s, to me , more likely. Of course, if —if inflation were\nto surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that , and that would—\n\nthat would be a surprise at this point. But I have to tell you, that ’s why we keep our options open\nhere and why we ’re not , you know, rushing. So I , I think both of those are risks, but I think the\nmore likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is , you’ ve had six good months —very good\nmonths —but what, what ’s really going to “ shake out ” here? You know, where —what will—\nwhen we look back, what will we see? Will , will inflation have dipped and then come back up?\nAre the last six months flattered by factors that are —that are one-off factors that won ’t repeat\nthemselves? We don’ t think so. We don’t —you know, that ’s not what we think, but that ’s the\nquestion we are asking . We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. And just one quick follow -up—Governor Waller had\nmentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something\nyou’re watching as well? And if , if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you\nmore confidence where things are going?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ ll just have to see. Yeah. We’ ll—we look at those. Last year\nwas a—was a, a surprise.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television. If you don’ t\nwant to use the term “ soft landing,” would you say, at least , that, from your point of view now,\nthe other scenario of a hard landing caused by the F ed is off the table or the risks have\ndiminished very much? And you mentioned below –2 percent inflation for —on a three -month\nbasis, core PCE has been running at 1 ½ percent. And there are those on Wall Street who think\nthat if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So , how to—your first question—how to describe where we are? So\nI guess I would just say this —executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over\nthe course of last year. The labor market —3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor\nmarket is strong. We’ ve had just about two years now of , of unemployment under 4 percent.\nThat hasn ’t happened in 50 years. So it ’s a good labor market. And we ’ve seen inflation come\ndown. We’ ve talked about that. So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an\nexpectati on that there ’s more to come. So this is a —this is a good situation. Let ’s be honest.\nThis is a— this is a good economy.\nBut what ’s the outlook? That ’s looking in the re arview —the outlook—we do expect\ngrowth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’ t happened, but\nwe do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its\ncourse. The l abor market is rebalancing , as, as I mentioned . Job creation has slowed. The base\nof job growth has narrowed. And , of course, 12- month inflation is, is above target and getting,\nyou know, getting down closer to target. It ’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on\ntrack for that. So those are the risks and , and questions we have to answer. But , overall, this is a\npretty good picture. It, it is a good picture. Your second question was —sorry.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Could you get inflation that is below target —end up with inflation\nbelow target , and you have to do something about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we —the thing is, we ’re not looking for inflation to tap the\n2 percent base once. We ’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent. And the same\nthing is true if we have a month or two of lower —and we have that now —of, of inflation that ’s\nannualized at a —at a lower level—that wouldn’ t be good. We’ re not —you know, we’re not\nlooking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent. We’ re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.\n\nSo if we do face those circumstances, then we’ ll have to deal with that. I think —I think as of\nnow, you know, the , the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish\nthe job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you,\nMr. Chairman, for taking this. So , as I ’ve—as I’ve heard from some District F ed presidents, is\nit, in your view , a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner? And then\nwhen we do see that first rate cut, is that —should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate -cut\ncycle, or is it a one -off?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’ll point you to that language on your first question. We, we\nincluded that language in the statement to signal clearly that —with strong growth, strong labor\nmarket, inflation coming down —the C ommittee intends to move carefully as we consider when\nto begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current\ncontext —current context, we’re going to be data dependent. We’re going to be looking at this\nmeeting by meeting. Based on the meeting toda y, I would tell you that I don’ t think it’ s likely\nthat the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify\nMarch as the time to do that. But that’ s, that’s to be seen. So I wouldn’ t call —you know, when\nyou say —when you ask me about “ in the near term, ” I’m hearing that as March. I would say I\ndon’t think that’s —that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base\ncase. And your second question is —\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. On, on the —is this the start of a —when we see a cut, is it the\nstart of a cutting cycle , or is it —could it just be a one -off?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, that ’s going to depend on the data. The whole thing is,\nthis is going to depend on the data. We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects\nthe outlook and the balance of risks. And we ’re going to make our decisions based on that. And\nit could wind up—you know, we ’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting , and, and\npeople will write down what they think. But , in the end, it ’s really going to depend on how the\neconomy evolves. We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower —for\nexample, stronger inflation—more , more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us\nto—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or —and sooner. And that would be a\nweakening in the labor market or , for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation. Those\nare the kinds of things. So we ’re just —we’re just going to be reacting to the data. That ’s the—\nthat’s re ally the only way we can do this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more\nabout productivity growth? You know, you’ ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the\nlevel of wage growth that’ s consistent with 2 percent inflation. We’ ve obviously seen, you\nknow —you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it ’s cooled a little bit but still sort of\nabove what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do\nyou attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about —or do you think that\nproductivity growth will , will fade over time?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is a really interesting question. And I think— my, my own\nview is —I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you , you saw a spike in productivity as\nworkers were laid off , and , and activity didn’ t decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough\n\nof productivity. And then, over the last —you saw high productivity last year , in ’23. I think\nwe’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question\nwill be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on,\nyou know, fundamental aspects of our economy. Is there —is there a case—will it be the case\nthat we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis? And I don’ t know. I don’t know.\nWhat would it take? It would take —you know, people talk about AI, but I would— my guess is\nthat we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t —I’m not sure I see—work\nfrom home doesn’ t seem like it ’s a big productivity increase . Or AI, artificial intelligence —\ngenerative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run. So\nI’m not —I’m not seeing why it would, but , you know, right —you know, right now I would say\nthat productivity is kind of what falls out of the , the broader forces that are driving people in and\nout of the labor force and , and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Right. So would that be behind why we ’ve seen such strong\ngrowth, but we ’ve also seen inflation fall —that maybe there ’s just a higher level of productivity?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s one way to look at it. Yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I ’m wondering—how closely are you\nwatching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates? And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we think about, you know —our , our statutory goals are\nmaximum employment and price stability, and that ’s what we ’re targeting. We’ re not targeting\nhousing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things. Those are very important\n\nthings for people ’s lives. But they’re not —you know, those are not the things we ’re targeting.\nWe’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the\nhousing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates,\nthe housing industry can be hurt , because it ’s a very interest -sensitive sector.\nOn top of that, we have longer -run problems with the availability of housing. You know,\nwe have a, a built -up set of cities , and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.\nSo there ’s—there hasn ’t been enough housing built. And these are not —these are not things that\nwe have any tools to address. But , you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our\nwork is inflation, which is a combination. It ’s, it’s really rental inflation. You’re taking owners ’\nequivalent rent and then ac tual rent paid by tenants. And you’ re, you’re running that through the\nCPI calculation . Or the PCE [inflation] calculation —the one we look at. And what that ’s telling\nyou is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will\nshow up in inflation over time. It has to as long as that remains the case.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. And just real quick—what is your response to the\nletter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the F ed to lower interest rates to\nmake housing more affordable?\nCHAIR POWELL. My response is what I started with, which is that our , our job—the\njob Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is\nabsolutely essential for people ’s lives, m ost importantly for —well, not most importantly— most,\nmostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges —at the\nmargins. And so someone —for someone like that, high inflation in the —in the necessities of\nlife—right away , you’ re in trouble, whereas even middle -class people have some , you know,\nsome scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get —it’s our job. It’s what society has asked\n\nus to do, is to get inflation down , and t he tools that we use to do it are interest rates. So that ’s\nhow we think about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Court enay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Court enay Brown from Axios. Can you give us some insight\ninto whether the C ommittee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the\nmonths ahead?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has\ngone very well. And as the process has continued, you know, we ’re getting to that time where\nquestions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at\nthis meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we ’re planning to begin in -\ndepth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those , those\nquestions are all coming into scope now, and we ’re focusing on them. But we ’re, we’re at the\nbeginning of that process, I would say.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Quick follow -up—i s it the case that the F ed would decide to\nlower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools. And so they\ndon’t —for example, if you ’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but\ncontinuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases, that ’s normalization, but from a strict\nmonetary policy standpoint, you could say we ’re loosening along with tightening. So that , that\ncould happen. It’ s not something we ’re planning or thinking about , but right now, we ’re\nthinking about getting to a place where —we ’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.\nWe’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ ll—we’ll be looking into that as a C ommittee\nstarting in March.\n\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist. Thank you, Chair\nPowell. You ’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build\nup confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’ t\nstart easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.\nRoughly how many months do you think you might need of , of good inflation data to be —to be\nconfident?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it. I ’m just going to\nsay—and it ’s not that we don’ t have any confidence. We, we have growing confidence, but not\nto the point where we —where we feel like —it’s a highly consequential decision to start the\nprocess of , of dialing back on restriction. And w e want to get that right, and we feel like the\nstrong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.\nWe think that ’s the best way we can serve the public, because , ultimately, we, we ’ve made a lot\nof progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable\nway. That ’s how we ’re thinking about it. In terms of when that ’ll be, you know, that, that ’ll all\ncome out of our communications, and , you know, we won’t —we won ’t keep that a secret.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Evan .\nEVAN RYSER. Hi, Chair Powell . Evan R yser with MNI Market News. Can you\nexplain a little bit more on what you’ re considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the\novernight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Not a decision that we ’ve made, but I , I wouldn’ t think we ’d, we’d\nbe—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it ’s got to go to zero. I mean, if it—if it were to\nstabilize at a different level—but that ’s, that’s not a decision that we ’ve made. That ’s, that’s\nwhat we ’ll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up,\nand the C ommittee will get into —get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of\nthe next, let ’s say, year or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg .\nGREG ROBB. Thanks. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I want to change\ngears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that’ s been going on for the last nine\nmonths or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates ha d said that they\nprobably wouldn’ t want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about\nthat. Do you want another term —you’ve had— on the F ed? What , what ’s your stance on that?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t have a stance on that. It’ s not something I’ m focused on.\n[We’re] focused on doing our jobs. We have—t his year is going to be a highly consequential\nyear for , for the F ed and for monetary policy. A nd we ’re, all of us , very buckled down, focused\non doing our jobs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over\nthe past six months . And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year , at 2.4\npercent , compared to that six -month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for\nthree rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it ’s been over the last six months\nfor the next six months?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I —you know, we’re going to do—w e’ll update our , our inflation\nforecasts at the next meeting. You referred to the December meeting. That ’s, that’s, you know,\nthree months old [by March] , so it might be lower now , given the data we ’ve gotten. So , look, as\nI mentioned, we ’re going to be reacting to the data. If, if we get —if we get very strong inflation\ndata and it , it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we ’ll go slower or later or both. If we got really\ngood inflation data soon, that would matter for both the —that, that would tell us that, that we\ncould go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we’re just going to be —but , of course, we ’ll weigh\nthat with all the other factors. We ’re setting policy based on the totality of , of the data.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But just to follow —if inflation stays where it is currently,\nthat would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive. Would that mean\nyou’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think if we —if we came to the view that , that inflation\nwere —that the six -month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent] , were , in “ PCE\nworld ”—if we came to —if that’s —if we thought that is really where we ’re going to be, then,\nyes, our policy would be in a different place. It would. But , you know, that ’s the whole point is ,\nwe’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where —that inflation is on a\nsustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Daniel.\nDANIEL AVIS. Hi, Chair Powell. Daniel Avis, Agence France- Presse. I just wondered\nif I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that\nconsumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just\nwonder —is it fair to say that they ’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in\n\nrecent months? And , you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has\nplayed a role in that? And what challenges do you see , going forward? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so it ’s been —it’s been interesting that confidence surveys\nhave been weak , at a time when unemployment has been low —very low, historically low —for a\ncouple of years. And —but , nonetheless, that ’s been the case. And we ’ve asked ourselves why\nthat is. And , you know, one obvious answer —we don’ t pretend to have perfect wisdom on\nthis—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So prices went up much more\nthan 2 percent for year —per year for a couple of years. And people are going to the store, and\nthey’ re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.\nAnd they’ re not happy about it. And it ’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price —the\nprices they ’re paying are still high.\nSo that , that is what —that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy. And\nthey’ re, they’re right to be unhappy. You know, t his is why we need to keep price stability. It ’s\nwhy we need to do our jobs —so that people don’ t have to deal with things like this.\nIn terms of [surveys] —you’re right. In, in recent , recent surveys, a couple of —you’ ve\nseen a couple of significant increases in , in consumer confidence or , or happiness with the\neconomy. I guess that ’s a good thing. That can —that can support spending—can support\neconomic activity. There ’s some evidence of that. But it is —it is a fact that we have seen , you\nknow, a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ ve\nbeen at various times. But it’s —they certainly have come up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Bryan .\nBRYAN MENA. Thank you for taking our questions. B ryan Mena , CNN Business.\nCommittee members have said they ’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in\n\nperson to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large\nrevisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So did any members say they’ ve learned anything not reflected in the\ndata? Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’ t been\ncaptured in the data yet?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. I’m, I’m a big believer that— yes. So we , we do meet\nwith outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like\nyou—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies —individual\ncompanies —individual management teams —and then building out from that. And so, starting\nwith GDP data is —and working into what ’s actually affecting people ’s lives is—is challenging.\nIt’s very hard. So I , I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 R eserve B anks\nhave really the best network of anyone. In all their D istricts, they ’re talking to , you know, not\njust the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit\ncommunity. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back —that ’s what goes\ninto the Beige Book. But they come back, and what each R eserve B ank president does is, during\nthe outlook go- around, they ’ll say, “I n my D istrict . . .” And they’ ll talk about 100 conversations\nthey—not —they won’t talk—t hey, they will give you input , based on 100 conversations that\nthey’ ve had with people of all different walks. And it’s —I personally find it very helpful in\nunderstanding what ’s going on. And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the\ndata sometimes.\nBRYAN MENA. Did any of them —did any of them notice slowing economy based on\nwhat they’ ve heard from, like, their D istrict?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, if you—if you look back at the last —not this Beige\nBook, but the one before , it was more —there was a lot of “ slower activity. ” I think that , that\nwhat you’ re hearing now is , is, things are picking up a bit. You’re hearing —not , not in every\nDistrict and not every , every person that we talk to, but you’re —overall, it feels like you ’re\nhearing things picking up at the margin. So that ’s what comes through.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, sir. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all\ntogether : You talked about basically the , the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent\nannualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to\nyou now than any inflation threat might? That, you know —you’ re in a position, in other words,\nto keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’ re more —you’ re more tilted\ntowards that. And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too\nstrong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not so worried about that. You know, it’s —again, we ’ve had\ninflation come down without a slow economy and without , you know, important increases in , in\nunemployment, and there ’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process , if\nit’s going to continue. So I , I am —you know, I think—I think declining inflation —continued\ndeclines in inflation are, are really the main thing we ’re looking at. Of course, we want the labor\nmarket to remain strong, too.\nWe don’ t have a growth mandate. We ’ve got a , a maximum -employment mandate and a ,\na price -stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the\nextent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.\nThank you very much."
