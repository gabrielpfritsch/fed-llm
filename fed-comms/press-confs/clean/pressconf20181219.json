[Cough] Pardon me.\nOver the past year the economy ha s been growing at a strong pac e, the unemployment\nrate has been near record lows , and inflation has been low and stable. All of those things remain\ntrue today. Since the Septembe r meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have\nemerged. I’ll explain how my co lleagues and I are incorporatin g those crosscurrents into our\njudgments about the outlook and t he appropriate course of polic y.\nSince September, the U.S. econom y has continued to perform well , roughly in line with\nour expectations. The economy ha s been adding jobs at a pace t hat will continue bringing the\nunemployment rate down over time. Wages have moved up for work ers across a wide range of\noccupations—a welcome developmen t. Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the\nyear a bit more subdued than most had expected. Although some American families and\ncommunities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong\neconomy is benefiting many Americans.\nDespite this robust economic backdrop and our expectation for h ealthy growth, we have\nseen developments that may signa l some softening relative to wh at we were expecting a few\nmonths ago. Growth in other econo mies around the world has mod erated somewhat over the\ncourse of 2018, albeit to still-solid levels. At the same time , financial market volatility has\nincreased over the past couple of months, and overall financial conditions have tightened—that\nis, they have become le ss supportive of growth.\nIn our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook. Most\nFOMC participants have, instead, m odestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nyear. The projections of Committ ee participants released today show growth continuing at\nhealthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and infla tion remaining near\n2 percent. The projections also s how a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate, which\nshould support the economy and keep us near our goals. As the economy struggled to recover\nfrom the financial crisis a nd the subsequent recession, the Com mittee held our policy rate near\nzero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to rec over. And the economy did\nrecover steadily, if slowly at times.\nThree years ago the Committee cam e to the view that the best wa y to achieve our\nmandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels tha t are more normal in a healthy\neconomy. Today we raised our target range for the short-term i nterest rates by another\n¼ percentage point. As I’ve mentio ned, most of my colleagues e xpect the economy to continue\nto perform well in the coming year . Many FOMC participants had expected that economic\nconditions would likely call for about three more rate increase s in 2019. We have brought that\ndown a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy wil l grow in a way that will call for\ntwo interest rate increases over the course of next year.\nWe always emphasize that our po licy decisions are not on a pres et course and will change\nif the incoming data materiall y change the outlook. And, given recent developments, the\nstatement notes that we “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments\nand assess their implications for the economic outlook.”\nNow I will provide some additiona l context and detail, starting with a review of policy\nover the last year. Last December, the unemployment rate was 4 .1 percent, and inflation had\nbeen running just below 2 percen t. FOMC participants and many other forecasters were\npredicting that grow th in 2018 would be strong. This growth wa s predicted to push the\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nunemployment rate down to near his toric lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was\nexpected to help push i nflation up to 2 percent.\nGiven this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropria te way to sustain the\nexpansion with inflation near 2 pe rcent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary\nsupport for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years. Thus, in December 2017,\nthe median of the projections of FOMC participants pointed to t hree ¼ point interest rate\nincreases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at\n2 to 2¼ percent, still below most e stimates of the longer-run n ormal rate.\nEarly in 2018, it became clear tha t the economy was likely to be even stronger than we\nhad expected, in part because the fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and\nmore front-end loaded than most ha d anticipated. The signs of a more robust economy proved\naccurate, and the FOMC has now rai sed rates four times this yea r, counting today’s action, one\nmore time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago.\nThis illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always e mphasize. In 2018, the\neconomy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to a slightly faster pace of\npolicy normalization than had been projected. When the economy has, instead, turned out\nweaker than expected, the Comm ittee has slowed or paused the pa ce of rate increases as we did\nin 2016. And when the economy has performed about as expected, the Committee has generally\nmoved in line with the med ian projection as we did in 2017.\nWhat kind of year will 2019 be? We know that the economy may n ot be as kind to our\nforecasts next year as it was this year. History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds\nmay buffet the economy and call fo r more than a slight change f rom the policy projections\nreleased today.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nWith that caveat, there are tw o important differences in the po licy outlook today versus\nnext year. In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth\nmoderating ahead. FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted\nsome moderation of growth in 2019. T he additional tightening o f financial conditions we have\nseen over the past couple of mont hs along with signs of somewha t weaker growth abroad have\nalso led us to mark down growth a nd inflation projections a bit. The median of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections show s growth of 3 percent this year a nd 2.3 percent in 2019. With\ngrowth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is\nprojected to fall a bit furt her, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2 019. Inflation in the median\nprojection remains near 2 percent.\nSecond, the economy has continued to strengthen this year. And , given our four rate\nincreases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller\nboost to the economy in 2019. After today’s action, the target range for the feder al funds rate is\n2¼ to 2½ percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of e stimates of the longer-run normal\nrate provided by the Committee.\nOver the next year, if events pl ay out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be\nin a range in which judgments of people both inside and outside the Fed will sometimes differ\nregarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodativ e, neutral, or modestly\nrestrictive. When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes poli cy in light of the array of diverse\nviews on the Committee. Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy\nclosely for indications that th e stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a\nstrong labor market and i nflation near 2 percent.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nIt is worth noting that the Summ ary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the\nindividual projections of all FO MC participants. We sometimes point to the median of these\nprojections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee. Each participant’s\nprojection represents appropr iate policy under the baseline out look—baseline outlook provided\nby that participant. We believe t hat the SEP provides useful i nformation about Committee\nparticipants’ thinking, but the me dian is not a consensus judgm ent and certainly does not\nrepresent a Committee plan. Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed\nlight on the state of the ec onomy, the outlook, and the changin g balance of risks.\nNeither the pace nor the ultimate destination of any further ra te increases is\npredetermined. We will adjust monetary policy as best we can t o keep the expansion on track,\nthe labor market strong, and inf lation near 2 percent. We know that our policy decisions affect\nall American families and businesses, and we’ll continue to mak e our decisions objectively and\nbased solely on the best inf ormation and analysis. Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your\nquestions.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. One of\nthe recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data. I w onder, first of all, if you could explain\nwhy you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way\nof inflationary pressu res. And in the context of a more data-d ependent Fed, how will the Fed\nrespond to further undershoots of inflation moving into next year? Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, you’re rig ht, Sam. Inflation has come in just a touch\nbelow where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount. More broadly,\n2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the fina ncial crisis. And during that\nperiod we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflat ion has still remained just a\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \ntouch below 2 percent. So I do thi nk that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving\nforward. As I mentioned, there’s significant uncertainty about the—both the path and the\nultimate destination of any further rate increases.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. Today, the Fed\nlowered its expectations for interest rate increases. Given th at, I’m wondering if the Fed has had\nany discussion of altering the cour se of balance sheet normaliz ation and if you could give us any\ninsight on what might lead the F OMC to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. If you go b ack some years, I think we— people who were\nworking at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 t ook away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive\nto news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and\nthings like that. So we thought carefully about this, on how t o normalize policy, and came to the\nview that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use\nmonetary policy, rate policy, t o adjust to incoming data.\nAnd I think that has been a good decision. I think that the ru noff of the balance sheet has\nbeen smooth and has served its purpose. And I don’t see us changing that. And I do think that\nwe will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate p olicy, as the active tool of\nmonetary policy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chairman\nPowell, you talked a little bit ea rlier about the ability to be patient. And so as you think about\nyour next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current r ecent pace to a slightly different\ndestination that’s laid out i n the projections today? Or does the current environment of\nrestrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few moves and take more time to\nget there?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as background, I would just point to 2018 being a very\nstrong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still having what amounts to a\npositive forecast. We still are forecasting, individually, gro wth a bit above its longer-run\npotential—2.3 percent is what we’re forecasting. We’re forecas ting that growth will be strong\nenough that unemployment will drop still further and inflation will remain right near our target.\nSo I’d say that’s a reasonably positive forecast.\nGoing forward, you know, I will be l ooking, in particular, to see whether incoming data\ntell us that we’re, in fact, on tha t path, that development of the economy is in line with that\nexpectation. That will be the main thing. More broadly, thoug h, I think we’ve reached the\nbottom end of the range of Comm ittee estimates of what might be neutral. I think, from this\npoint forward, we’re going to be l etting the data speak to us a nd form the outlook and inform our\nunderstanding of what would be a ppropriate policy. So there’s a fairly high degree of\nuncertainty about both the path a nd the ultimate destination of any further increases.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Could you t ell us how three\nthings affected the outlook for t he economy and rates? The fir st is how the market’s decline\naffected the outlook for the economy and for rates. The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or\nhow you factor that into your outlo ok. And the third is commen ts by the President urging you\nnot to hike rates.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as I menti oned, we monitor a broad range of economic\nconditions, including financial c onditions—a broad range of financial conditions. And we took\non board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly\nspeaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really. So we took that on board in our forecast. Tha t’s why the forecast for gro wth and inflation went down a little\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nbit. But, remember, that’s in a context of a more accommodativ e path. So we also took down\nour rate forecast. So we defin itely did take that into account , and, as you can see from the\nstatement language, we acknowledge d those risks in the clause a bout monitoring developments.\nAnd we’re going to be watching car efully to see as those things develop.\nI think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market\npeople about global growt h, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be\npartly about a variety of things . If you just mechanically dro p into a model of the U.S. economy\ntariffs, you don’t see very large effects. The large effects w ould have to come from financial\nmarket changes or from losses in business confidence. And those are things that are very\ndifficult to model.\nOn your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever\nin our discussions or decisions about monetary policy. We’re a lways going to be focused on the\nmission that Congress has given us . We have the tools to carry it about. We have the\nindependence, which we think i s essential t o be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way. And\nyou know, we are—we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will\ndeter us from doing what we t hink is the right thing to do.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. You’re about to\nundershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year. Your new forecasts say that you’re\ngoing to undershoot it for the ei ghth straight year. Should we interpret the dot plot as suggesting\nthat some members of your Comm ittee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the\nend of next year? If so, can you help us to understand why peo ple would be advocating\nrestrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation u ndershoots?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inf lation\nundershoots. And you’re right, infl ation has continued to surp rise to the downside—not by a lot,\nthough. I think we’re very clo se to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it’s a symmetric\ngoal for us. Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that ’s how we’re going to look at it.\nWe’re not trying to be under 2 perc ent. We’re trying to be sym metrically around 2 percent. And\nI don’t—you know, I’ve never said t hat I feel like we’ve achiev ed that goal yet. The only way to\nachieve inflation symmetricall y around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around\n2 percent, and we’ve been close t o that but we haven’t gotten t here yet, and we have not declared\nvictory on that. So that remains to be accomplished.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News. Just foll owing up on\nBinya’s question—I guess if you have n’t achieved 2 percent infl ation and you don’t see an\novershoot, which would be sort of implied by a symmetrical targ et, what’s the point in raising\nrates again at all?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, again, I go back to the health of the eco nomy. If you look\nat 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis. You’ve had growth well\nabove trend. You’ve got unemploym ent dropping. You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.\nAnd we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in t hat context, we think this move\nwas appropriate for what is a very healthy economy.\nPolicy at this point does not need to be accommodative. It can move to neutral. It seems\nappropriate that it be neutral. We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral.\nSo that’s the basis upon which w e made the decision. I also th ink we took on board, you know,\nthe risks to that, and, you know, w e’re certainly cognizant of them.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairma n, Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You’ve\nestablished for this coming year a communicatio ns panel to look at how the Fed communicates.\nCould you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from t hat panel, and will the dot plot be\ninvolved in that at all? H ow do you think the dot plot is work ing? Are we dealing with it the\nway that you want us to be handli ng the dot plot, or is it something that you mi ght tweak a bit?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So this review, w hat it really is—it’s coming at a time when\nthe economy is strong, and it’s a goo d time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our\nstrategy and our tools and our communications around monetary p olicy are doing the job that\nCongress has assigned us to do on be half of the American people . And what we’re going to do\nis, we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all\ndifferent parts of the economy, including, you know, an academi c conference in June in Chicago.\nAnd, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, bett er ideas, old ideas—many of\nthem have been around—and try to assess whether there are bette r ways we can do things. One\nof the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three\ndecades now. We may be in a worl d where interest rates are jus t lower for the time being, and,\ntherefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic do wnturns. And we’d want to be\nevaluating ideas for—again, for be tter achieving the goals that Congress has given us.\nWe’re not looking at law change s at all, and we’re not looking at changing t he inflation\ntarget, for example. We are look ing for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example,\non a symmetric basis. So that’s the sense of that.\nAs I mentioned, on the dot plot—yo u asked about the dot plot. I think the dot plot\ngenerally does provide useful in formation about the reaction fu nction of Committee\nparticipants—sometimes more usef ul than others, I’ll admit. Bu t, in general, I think people sort\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nof have it figured out and unders tand what it is and what it is n’t. But that doesn’t mean we don’t\nlike to repeat what it isn’t, whi ch—it’s not a consensus foreca st. It’s not something that we vote\non. It’s something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data\ncome in and as we update our outlooks.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee fr om Bloomberg Radio and Televisi on. The\nbalance sheet reduction—how much additi onal tightening do you t hink has come from that? We\nknow in the markets that the co st of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread\nwidening—do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow\nthe markets? And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don’t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So we do watc h all of that, but the amount of —the amount of\nrunoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small. And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes. So we\ndon’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven\nby many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff. For example, just—very large bill\nsupply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates . Tightening of the federal funds\nrate has raised short-term borrowing costs. So, you know, we’r e alert to these issues. We’re\nwatching them carefully. But we don’t see, you know, the balan ce sheet runoff as creating\nsignificant problems.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Hi, Edward Law rence, Fox Business Network. T hank you,\nMr. Chairman. We’ve seen enorm ous volatility in the markets re cently. We know the President\nsaid, you know, don’t raise interest rates. It’s well documented. The National Association of Realtors’ chief economist says t hat it’s starti ng to affect fir st-time homebuyers with the mortgage\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nrates going up. When do you think t hese pauses need to come in next year? Do we need to keep\nthis, as you say, gradual? And then, in addition, what data ar e you specifically looking at for you\nthat shows when the Federal Reser ve starts to become that headw ind in the economy with the\nrates?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we’re w atching—we have a strong forecast,\ngenerally, for next year. That forecast involves growth, you k now, between 2 and 2½ percent. It\ninvolves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving un employment down and inflation\nnear 2 percent. So that’s a pretty positive forecast. So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking\nfor data that suggests that tha t’s, in fact, the path that we’r e on.\nAs I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think\nit’s appropriate to be putting asi de individual estimates of that and be looking at what the\nincoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might\nbe, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and\nletting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, yo ur appropriate path for policy. So\nthat’s what we mean when we say w e’re “data dependent.” Of cou rse, we’re always data\ndependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this cont ext, which is that.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chair man. I wanted to ask, first of a ll, whether you’re\nworried that President Trump’s tweeting and statements might in terfere with your ability to\ncommunicate with markets and w hy you’re doing what you’re doing. And then, also, I was\nwondering if you could comment on—Governor Brainard gave a spee ch recently where she laid\nout the case for the countercyc lical capital buffer being activ ated. Do you disagree with her\nanalysis? Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I’m not worri ed, because—about—on the first q uestion—\nbecause I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that w e’re going to do our jobs the\nway we’ve always done them. And that involves, you know, I thi nk getting the best thinking\ntogether, diverse perspectives. We—every business—every FOMC c ycle, we talk to hundreds of\npeople in all different parts of society, not just business peo ple or market people, but people from\ncommunity development organizatio ns. We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we\nreally do have a pretty broad e xposure to what’s going on in all different parts of the country.\nAnd we’re going to take all that information, and we’re going to make the best decisions we can,\nand nothing will cause us to deviate from that.\nIn terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is—the countercyclical capita l buffer is a tool that\nallows us to build capital at a t ime when vulnerabilities—finan cial stability vulnerabilities—are\nmeaningfully above normal. And so that’s a tool I’d be absolut ely willing to use and happy to\nuse at such time as that test is met. We meet and discuss that and evaluate it on roughly an\nannual basis. We haven’t done i t since early this year. I think we’ll be doing it early next year,\nand we’ll be reaching that judgment then. I will tell you, I r ecently gave a sp eech saying that I\nbelieve that financial stabili ty vulnerabilities were roughly a t a moderate level. So, for me,\nthat—but I would want to leav e open—my mind open on that and ha ve that discussion with my\nBoard colleagues when the issue arises.\nANN SAPHIR. Ann Saphir with Reuters. You said that policy doe s not need, at this\npoint, to be accommodative. But does it need to be restrictive , as the dots seem to suggest that it\nwill be?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Does it current ly need to be restrictive? No . And I don’t\nbelieve that it is. I don’t believe that po licy is restrictive .\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nANN SAPHIR. Next year. The dots suggest it will be restrictiv e next year. Should\nit be?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, I—I’ve di scussed this a couple of times . It’s a very good\nquestion. And I guess I would just go back to this: The indiv idual forecasts are not something\nthat the Committee votes on. They’re out in the future. We vote on the rate increase, and we\nwrite down our—you know, our own personal paths. So people hav e disparate views on what\nthe endpoint could be.\nUltimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are. There would be\ncircumstances in which it w ould be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be\ncircumstances in which it woul d be wholly inappropriate to do s o. So I don’t—I wouldn’t put\ntoo much on—it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things. But don’t—I\nwouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near -term policy.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Paul Kiernan f rom Dow Jones Newswires. Than ks for the\nquestion. In Dallas last mont h you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses,\nsometimes hearing things that aren’t yet showing up in the econ omic data. And I was just\nwondering if you’re hearing anythin g from businesses that might explain the recent market\nmoves. You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn ’t showed up yet in the data?\nThanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, if you look at the Tealbook, or—you know, we get the\nTealbook in person from the Rese rve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their\ndiscussions not just with their directors, but with literally h undreds of business and nonprofit,\nyou know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really\n1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealb ook.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \ninteresting. My background is ve ry much working—starting with, you know, a small group of\npeople, maybe a company, and w orking out. So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me\ncapture the picture better.\nSo—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a\nmood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going for ward, if I could just capture it in\none thought. There are many reasons that are given for that, b ut, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a\nconcern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was? Why not? What might it be—to\ndifferent people? But that mood i s out there. That doesn’t me an that it’ll come i nto the real data\nin a big way—it may, but—or that fi nancial conditions will tighten further. We’ll just have to\nsee. For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit . We’ve taken t hat on board both in\nthe outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to —you know, to provide some\naccommodation to push back against that tightening. That’s how I think about it.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Just following up on P aul’s question—\nPresident Trump said recently that you should feel the markets. So when you see the markets,\nyou know, what are the markets telling you?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, financial conditions—broadly speaki ng, we don’t\nlook at any one market. We look at a really big range of finan cial conditions. And what matters\nfor the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are\nsustained for a period of time . A little bit of volatility—spe aking in the abstract—some volatility\ndoesn’t probably leave a mar k on the economy. So we look for that.\nAnd, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tighten ing. There’s been a tightening since\nright around after—a week or so a fter the September meeting. A nd, you know, that—we tried to\nfactor that into our models of t he economy and to the results t hat come out of those models.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nThat’s how we think about it. So we do, you know—we follow mar kets really carefully. But,\nremember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator\nand it really matters if changes are sustained over time.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER . Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Do you\nstill think core PCE is a good m easure of whether the economy i s overheating? What do you\nthink of other measures like setting a target for economic grow th and relying more on that?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator.\nIt has—what’s happened over, rea lly, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to\nchanges in growth. There was a time when inflation reacted rea lly quickly to changes in growth\nand changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us. And t hat is often attributed to the\nsuccess of central banks in anchorin g inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation\nwill come back to the target or a round the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation\ndoesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when\nthe economy is strong.\nIt’s really true, though, that infl ation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent\nunemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment. Now, it did move up last year. But in terms\nof just targeting growth, you know , I think—I actually think ou r dual mandate works very well,\nwhich is maximum employment and s table prices. Most of the tim e, those two things work\ntogether. When they work temporar ily in different ways, we tak e a balanced approach. But I\nthink that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, D onna Borak with CNN. Next year, every\nmeeting will be a live meeting. S o, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the\nmarket anticipates when a rate hike is coming. How has the Com mittee thought through\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \ncommunicating those potential policy moves, especially in light of the fact of the tremendous\namount of uncertainty g oing into next year?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for\ncommunication. I certainly hope it will. That’s the plan. An d so, being able to come out after\neach meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate th at to the state of the economy\nand expectations for policy and global developments, I think it ’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be\nhelpful in explaining how we ’re thinking and, you know, explain ing what we’re thinking about\npolicy going forward. So that’s the plan. I do believe it wil l be a positive development.\nI think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we\nwould move at a quarterly mee ting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP. As\nyou know, we only update our projecti ons under the current appr oach quarterly, whereas we\nhave eight—eight meetings. So I think we’ll move to a more—we’ ll have the ability to move\neight—at eight different meetings . Not eight times, but at eig ht different meetings on the year.\nDONNA BORAK. I guess that’s sort of the question that I’m tryi ng to drive at is, in\nterms of communicating to the market, because we’ve been—the ma rket’s been so adjusted to\nthe fact that these are quar ter-end rate hikes, and now you hav e the potential to move eight times\na year—is the Fed thinking thr ough how it’s going to communicat e when it plans, especially\ngiven the amount of uncertainty?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward. If\nwe, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to\nhappen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences,\nand such.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. You mentioned broad-bas ed wage gains this\nyear, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage growth and just how much slack\nthere is in the labor market.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we’ve se en is, is a very gradual—and, I think,\nongoing—increase in wages. If you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many\nindicators of wages and compens ation. But there are four princ ipal ones. And they were all kind\nof clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent i ncrease per year. Now they are\nall at 3, and they’ve just con tinued to gradually move up—not p erfectly in sync, but—and that’s\na number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inf lation and 1 percent productivity\ngrowth. So in an economic sense, it makes sense.\nI do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage inc reases will continue, and\nthat would be a welcome development. Wage—wage increases do no t need to be inflationary.\nThere’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late\n1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, w e had wage increases above\nproductivity plus inflation, and w e didn’t have high inflation. So it would be welcome. We hear\na great deal of anecdotal infor mation about labor shortages, al ong with other, you know,\nbottlenecks and things. So I woul d expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn’t\nnecessarily mean inflation. We don’t think of it that way. So did that answer your question?\nDON LEE. Labor slack?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Labor s lack. Yes. So, you know, by most ind icators—we look\nat a very wide range of indicator s on the labor market. And, b y most indicators, we are at or\neven above longer-run normal levels. But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is,\nlabor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particu larly prime-age males, is still,\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nyou know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level. Most other age groups in both genders have\nmoved back up pretty close to where they were at the last cycli cal peak. You know, there’s a\nquestion, can we go above that cy clical peak? And—or, or are the problems more structural than\ncyclical, and that there isn’t— so we’ll have to find that out. I think, given the strong economy,\nwe’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participat ion can be higher than we had\nthought. And that’s not hing but a good thing.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker. A regulatory question, if I\nmay. So, many of the Fed’s regul atory proposals so far, especi ally this year, have been primarily\nfocused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range. That is , a sort of tailoring enhanced\nprudential standards, particular ly for those banks, and I’m thi nking of the stress capital buffer as\nwell as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion.\nG-SIBs and the largest banks s eem to be sort of left out in a l ot of these proposals, and\nI’m wondering if that is meant to s end a message that the Fed d oes not really intend to change its\nregulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if you’ll get to that maybe later. And\nI’m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which several members of Congress\nhave sent letters to you asking you t o revisit and reconsider.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing\nhas been tailoring regulations. And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the\nlevel of the G-SIBs at the l arge regionals and then on down to the community banks at various\nsteps and ask whether we have appr opriately tailor ed regulation and supervision to account for\nthe fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the\neconomy and to the community shou ld they fail—should they exper ience material difficulty. So,\nin the nature of that, you’re foc used more on the smaller insti tutions.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nI think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and s upervision to be effective\nand efficient. I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker\nrule. That’s something we ’re working on. You know, we—we think that things need to be\nlooked at carefully. And, again, I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels, because, I\nthink, you know, it’s important that the largest financial inst itutions, the largest and most\ncomplex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher\nexpectations. And while we may tai lor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations\nare not going to change.\nSTEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance financial journalist reporting for NPR,\nChairman Powell. I know you look at many different financial i ndicators, but let me focus your\nattention briefly on bond yields. T he 10-year note yield has g one down pretty steeply, roughly\n50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks. I wonder what you m ake of it. Is it a worrisome sign\nfor you in terms of the outlook for growth, for inflation? On the other hand, could it be a\npositive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates a nd helping the housing sector?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Again, we do focus on a broad range of financ ial indicators,\nand I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one. You kn ow, we look at a whole range of\nthem, and we ask ourselves, what’ s really going on in the broad picture out there? You know, if\nyou ask what’s going on with the l ong—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has\ncome in some. That’s consis tent with, you know, a risk-off fee ling in the stock market as well.\nAnd, you know, we don’t know whether t hat’ll persis t. Really, the longer Treasury has moved in\na range above 3 percent and down 3 pe rcent as the risk sentimen t has changed. You know, I\nthink if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of\nexpectations of lower grow th. But, you know, we don’t know tha t that’ll happen. As I\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nmentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that\nwe’ll still have solid growth ne xt year, declining unemployment , and a healthy economy.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman, C ourtenay Brown from Axios. I’ m wondering\nif you could clear up what’s become a little bit of a debate in the financial community. You said\nin October in an interview with P BS that interest rates were a long way from neutral. A month\nlater you said interest rates we re just below neutral. And I t hink a lot of people interpreted that\nas a shift in tone from you. Were they right to interpret it t hat way?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, monetar y policy is a forward-lookin g exercise, and\nI’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that. It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the\nlower end of the range of neutra l. We’ve arrived effectively a t the bottom end of that range.\nAnd, you know, there are implications of that. For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—t he pace, rather, and the desti nation for further rate increases.\nAnd we’re going to be letting inco ming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path.\nMICHELLE FLEURY. Michelle Fleury, BBC News. Chairman Powell, you talked\nabout monitoring global developm ents. I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute\nwith China. But could you elabor ate on what economic developme nts you’re referring to,\nwhether Brexit is one of those? What else?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. More broadly, I’m referring to global growth. So, if you go\nback a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprise s in global growth. It was the\nyear of synchronized global growth. And people raised their fo recasts for growth around the\nworld kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018. What\nhas happened instead has been a modest retracing of that. So you have still healthy levels of\ngrowth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference \nglobal economy. But you no longer ha ve the really strong level s of growth you had in 2017. So\nthat is one—that’s, I think, the key fact.\nWe also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit—like, you kn ow, like the\nnegotiations between Italy and t he EU over their budget. And, you know, as far as those are\nconcerned, we monitor them very carefully. And I’m going to—I’ ll mention Brexit. Our\nfinancial institutions have had a long time now to get ready fo r the full range of possible exits\nfrom the EU by the U.K. And the y’ve had supervisory involvemen t from U.S. supervisors, from\nU.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors—we think they are fully p repared for the full range of\noutcomes that may come out of t hat. I was very happy to see th e developments around central\ncounterparties today. That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time\nbeing, resolved. So it’s somethi ng we’re watchi ng carefully. Honestly, it shouldn’t have major\nimplications for the United S tates, but, you know, there’s a lo t of uncertainty because it’s not\nsomething that’s happened befo re. So we’ll be watching it carefully. Thanks very much."
