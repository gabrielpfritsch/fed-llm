  "text": "CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Toda y the Federal Open Market C ommittee\nreaffirmed the current 0 to ¼ perc ent target range for the fede ral funds rate. Since the\nCommittee last met in April, the pace of job gains has picked u p and labor market conditions\nhave improved somewhat further . Inflation has c ontinued to run below our longer-run objective,\nbut some of the downward pressure on inflation re sulting from e arlier sharp declines in energy\nprices is abating. The Committee continues to judge that the f irst increase in the federal funds\nrate will be appropriate when it has seen further improvement i n the labor market and is\nreasonably confident that infla tion will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium\nterm. At our meeting that ended today, the Committee concluded that these conditions have not\nyet been achieved. It remains th e case that the Committee will determine the timing of the initial\nincrease in the federal funds r ate on a meeting-by-meeting basi s, depending on its assessment of\nincoming economic information and its implications for the econ omic outlook. Let me\nemphasize that the importance of the initial increase should no t be overstated: The stance of\nmonetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for qui te some time after the initial\nincrease in the federal funds rat e in order to s upport continue d progress toward our objectives of\nmaximum employment and 2 percent inflation. I will come back t o today’s policy decision in a\nfew moments, but first I would lik e to review recent economic d evelopments and the outlook.\nThe U.S. economy hit a soft patc h earlier this year; real gross domestic product looks to\nhave changed little in the fir st quarter. Growth in household spending slowed, business fixed\ninvestment edged down, and net export s were a substantial drag on growth. Part of this\nweakness was likely the result of transitory factors. Despite the soft first quarter, the\nfundamentals underlying househol d spending appear favorable, an d consumer sentiment remains\n\nsolid. Looking ahead, the Committee still expects a moderate p ace of GDP growth, with\ncontinuing job gains and lower energy prices supporting househo ld spending.\nThe labor market data so far this year have shown further progr ess toward our objective\nof maximum employment, although a t a slower pace than late last year. Over the past three\nmonths, job gains have averaged about 210,000 per month, down f rom an average pace of\n280,000 per month over the second hal f of last year, but still well above the pace consistent with\ntrend labor force growth. Alt hough the unemployment rate, at 5 .5 percent in May, was\nunchanged from the latest readi ng available at the time of our April meeting, the labor force\nparticipation rate edged up. A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who\nwant and are available to wor k but have not actively searched r ecently and people who are\nworking part time but would rather work full time has continued to improve. But it seems likely\nthat some cyclical weakness in the labor market remains: The p articipation rate remains below\nmost estimates of its underlyi ng trend, involuntary part-time e mployment remains elevated, and\nwage growth remains relat ively subdued. So, although progress clearly has been achieved, room\nfor further improvement remains.\nInflation has continued to r un below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower\nenergy prices. Declines in import prices have also restrained inflation. However, energy prices\nappear to have stabilized recen tly. My colleagues and I contin ue to expect that as the effects of\nthese transitory factors dissipa te and as the labor market impr oves further, inflation will\ngradually move back toward our 2 p ercent objective over the med ium term. Market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensa tion remain low, though they have risen some from their levels\nearlier this year, and survey-ba sed measures of longer-term inf lation expectations have remained\nstable. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation devel opments carefully.\n\nThis assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual e conomic projections\nsubmitted for this meeting by FOMC participants. As always, ea ch participant’s projections are\nconditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary poli cy. For economic growth,\nparticipants reduced their proj ections for this year, in line w ith the disappointing data for the first\nquarter. The central tendency of the growth projections for 20 15 is now 1.8 to 2.0 percent, down\na little more than ½ percentage po int from the March projection s. The central tendency rises to\n2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the l onger-run growth rate. The\nunemployment rate projections for this year are a little higher than in March. At the end of this\nyear, the central tendency for t he unemployment rate stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent, a bit above\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment r ate. Committee participants\ngenerally see the unemployment ra te declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.\nFinally, FOMC participants projec t inflation to be quite low th is year, largely reflecting lower\nenergy and non-energy import prices . The central tendency of t he inflation projections for this\nyear is below 1 percent, unchanged since March. As the transit ory factors holding down\ninflation abate, the central tendency rises to 1.6 to 1.9 perce nt next year and to 1.9 to 2.0 percent\nin 2017.\nReturning to monetary policy, as I noted, the Committee reaffir med its view that the\ncurrent 0 to ¼ percent target ra nge for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. As we said in\nour statement, the decision to rai se the target range will depe nd on our assessment of realized\nand expected progress toward our o bjectives of maximum employme nt and 2 percent inflation.\nWe continue to base that assessm ent on a wide range of informat ion, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflat ion expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international de velopments. And we continue to a nticipate that it will be\n\nappropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rat e when the Committee has seen\nfurther improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confi dent that inflation will move\nback to its 2 percent objectiv e over the medium term.\nOn both of these fronts, as I not ed, we have seen some progress . Even so, the Committee\njudged that economic conditions do not yet warrant an increase in the federal funds rate. While\nthe Committee views the disappoi nting economic performance in t he first quarter as largely\ntransitory, my colleagues and I would like to see more decisive evidence that a moderate pace of\neconomic growth will be sustained, so that conditions in the la bor market will continue to\nimprove and inflation will move back to 2 percent.\nOnce we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—as we say\nin our statement—“even after emp loyment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels,\neconomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the tar get federal funds rate below\nlevels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” In other words, alt hough policy will be\ndata dependent, economic conditions are currently anticipated t o evolve in a manner that will\nwarrant only gradual increases in the target federal funds rate .\nCompared with the projections mad e in March, most FOMC particip ants lowered\nsomewhat their paths for the fede ral funds rate, consistent wit h the revisions made to the\nprojections for GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The medi an projection for the federal\nfunds rate continues to point to a first increase later this ye ar, with the rate rising to about\n1¾ percent in late 2016 and 2¾ pe rcent in late 2017. In 2016 a nd 2017, the median path is about\n¼ percentage point below that pr ojected in March. The median p rojected rate in 2017 remains\nbelow the 3¾ percent or so projec ted by most FOMC participants as the longer-run value of the\nfederal funds rate even though the central tendency of the unem ployment rate by that time is\n\nslightly below its estimated l onger-run value and the central t endency for inflati on is close to our\n2 percent objective. Participant s provided a number of explana tions for the federal funds rate\nrunning below its normal longer-run l evel at that time. These included, in particular, the residual\neffects of the financial crisis , which are likely to continue t o constrain spending and credit\navailability for some time.\nI would like to emphasize that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds\nrate are conditional on participants’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for\neconomic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors. But our actual policy decisions over\ntime will depend on evolving economic conditions. Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be\nmore vigorous than currently an ticipated and inflation moves hi gher than expected, then the\nappropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper a nd higher traje ctory; conversely, if conditions\nwere to prove weaker, then the a ppropriate tra jectory would be lower and less steep.\nFinally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities a nd principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities shou ld help maintain accommodative\nfinancial conditions and promot e further progress toward our ob jectives.\nThank you. I’ll be happy to take your questions. YLAN MUI. Hi, Ylan Mui from the Washington Post . As you mentioned, almost all of\nthe FOMC participants believe that the first rate hike will com e this year. But two of your\ncolleagues believe that 2016 is th e appropriate time, the IMF h as called on 2016 as the\nappropriate time for liftoff as well, and markets seems to plac e a greater probability of liftoff in\nJanuary than they do in September. So what are—what is the mis understanding here? What\nis—what do they have wrong, and why do you think that waiting u ntil 2016 is a mistake?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, there are obviously a range of opinions, b oth in the market and\namong Committee members, at this time on what the appropriate s tance of policy is likely to be\nlater this year and next year. But , importantly, the—when the people write down their dots in the\nSEP, they’re making forecasts a bout what unfolding data is like ly to show. But the participants\nwill all be—their views will evolve with unfolding data.\nFor all of us, the appropri ate policy decision is going to be d ata dependent, and all of us\nwill be looking at incoming data . And our opinions about the a ppropriate timing of\nnormalization are likely to shi ft as we look at how the data ev olves. Differences in the\nappropriate assessments of the appropriate stance of policy—in addition to reflecting different\nviews on the outlook, there are a s et of risks that all of us n eed to weigh in judging on the—\njudging the appropriate time of t he beginning of normalization. On the one hand, waiting too\nlong to begin normalization can r isk significan tly overshooting our inflation objective given the\nlags in the operation of mone tary policy. And, on the other ha nd, beginning too early could risk\nderailing a recovery that we ha ve worked for a very long time t o try to achieve. And so we’re\ntrying to assess those risks.\nBut I want to emphasize, sometimes too much attention is placed on the timing of the\nfirst increase in the federal funds rate. And what should matt er to market participants is the\nentire trajectory, the entire expected trajectory of policy. A nd, again, while our actual policy\ndecisions will have to evolve in light of what really does happ en in the economy, the Committee,\nas you can see by the SEP projections , currently anticipates th at conditions will evolve in the\neconomy in a manner that will make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate gradually over\ntime.\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Madam Chair, I wonder if you might characterize the progress made\ntowards fulfilling the Fed’s tw o criteria. Are you somewhat mo re confident, not confident at all\nthat you’re moving towards 2 percen t? Has there been a lot of improvement in the labor market?\nSome improvement? And how shoul d we judge when those two crite ria have been fulfilled?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, it’ s a judgment that the Committee is—will have to make, and,\nas I’ve said previously and as we ’ve said in the statement, it will depend on a wide range of data\nand not on any simple indicators . So I can’t provide you—it wo uld be wrong for me to provide\nyou a roadmap that said something as simple as, if the unemploy ment rate declines to X, that\nthen the labor market will ha ve improved enough for us to begin to raise policy.\nObviously, we have to look at the pace of job creation. We hav e to look at what’s\nhappening to labor force particip ation, to part-time employment for economic reasons, to job\nopenings, to the pace of quits, t o wage inflation, and other in dicators of the state of the labor\nmarket. I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has d iminished to some extent in the\nintermeeting period, and, clearl y, over a longer span of time, over the last several years,\nobviously we’ve made considerab le progress in moving toward our goal of maximum\nemployment. So, in spite of the f act that there is some progre ss on that front, the Committee\nwants to see some further progre ss before feeling that it will be appropriate to raise rates.\nOn inflation, again, there has b een some progress, in the sense energy prices appear to\nhave stabilized. Now, inflati on is going to—overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a\nsubstantial period of time. The big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year\nand the beginning of this year , and they’re not going to wash o ut of the inflation data until late in\nthis year. But the fact that en ergy prices have stabilized mea ns that the pressure from that source\nis diminishing.\n\nIn addition, the dollar appears to have largel y stabilized. An d, with respect to core\ninflation, it has been runni ng under our 2 percent objective, b ut declining import prices have\nbeen reducing that pressure. I be lieve that as the labor marke t continues to improve and as our\nconfidence in that forecast rise s, at least for me, my confiden ce will also rise that inflation will\nmove back up toward 2 percent. I e xpect that to, over time, pu t upward pressure on core\ninflation.\nJON HILSENRATH. Thank you, Chair Y ellen. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street\nJournal. Two questions if I may. First , I wanted to ask you about a c omment that New York\nFed President William Dudley made recently that, in retrospect, the Fed should have raised\ninterest rates more aggre ssively during the 2004–2006 cycle. T his was in a footnote to a speech\nhe gave. I wonder if you agree with that and whether there are any lessons from the 2004–2006\ncycle that should be applied t oday. And, second, relating to C ongress, the Fed has resisted past\nefforts in Congress to pass measur es like an “Audit the Fed” bi ll or a measure to subject the Fed\nto a policy rule. There’s now a Shelby bill out there. I wond er if there’s anything in that that\nyou can accept and, more broadl y, whether there’s anything you could point to that Congress can\ndo to make the Fed a more effective institution and a more acco untable institution. Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Okay, so on the f irst question you asked about t he 2004–06 rate\nincrease cycle. Throughout that period, the Fed indicated that rates would rise at a measured\npace, and that turned out to be, I believe, 17 meetings, with 2 5 basis point increases at each\nmeeting. As I’ve emphasized, previously, we have—absolutely do not expect to follow any\nmechanical 25 basis points a meeting, 25 basis point every othe r meeting, no plan to follow any\ntype of mechanical approach to r aising the federal funds rate. We will evaluate incoming\nconditions and move in the manner that we regard as appropriate . So that’s one lesson. You\n\nknow, conceivably, I think, with t he benefit of hindsight, it m ight have been better to raise rates\nmore rapidly or more duri ng the 2004–06 cycle. You know, I’m n ot certain of that judgment, but\nI think there’s a case to be made.\nYou asked about Audit the Fed and the Shelby bill. The Shelby bill has a title in it that\naddresses a number of issues pertaining to the Fed. I suppose I would ask, what exactly is the\nproblem? We place high priorit y on being an accountable and tr ansparent central bank, and I\nthink that if you compare the t ransparency of monetary policy d ecisions in the Federal Reserve\nwith other central banks, we are one of the most transparent ce ntral banks in terms of the\ninformation that we provide to t he public in a whole variety of ways. To my mind, the Fed is\naccountable, and we work well as an institution. I’m not certa in what the problem is that needs\nto be addressed.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. First\nquestion is also referencing som ething that Bill Dudley said re cently, which is to do with the use\nof the balance sheet in tight ening monetary policy. He suggest ed that the short rates should be\nhiked some way from the zero lo wer bound before the Fed continu es—considers ending\nreinvestments. I wondered if you could give a little bit more clarity on how the Fed intends to\napproach the issue of ending rei nvestments on its balance sheet . Would you, for instance, see\nany argument for tapering the e nd to reinvestments to smooth th e profile of maturities in the\nportfolio? The second question is really on this point of “gra dual”—you’ve used this term today\nin the opening statement. Is the term “gradual” on its way to becoming official guidance from\nthe Fed? Is this something we should start to expect to see po pping up in official FOMC\nstatements in future? Thanks.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start w ith the balance sheet and our r einvestment policy.\nWe issued a normalization state ment giving principles of normal izing policy, and what we said\nat that time is that we expected to reduce or cease reinvestmen t at some time after we had begun\nthe process of normalizing polic y by raising our target for the federal funds rate. We said the\ntiming of that would depend on economic and financial condition s, and the Committee has really\nnot made any further decisions about how it’s going to go about doing that, so President Dudley\nwas expressing his own personal po int of view. But this is a m atter that the Committee has not\nyet decided, and I can’t provide any further detail. It’s obvi ously something we will be thinking\nabout.\nLet’s see, you asked about “grad ual.” So, in a sense, we alrea dy have a statement. The\nlast paragraph of the Federal Ope n Market Committee statement s ays: “The Committee\ncurrently anticipates that, eve n after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent\nlevels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate\nbelow levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.” That’s kind of a mouthful. It’s\na long sentence, but I think the s pirit of that sentence is con sistent with my use of the word\n“gradual,” and it is consistent with what you see in the Summar y of Economic Projections.\nParticipants are projecting—obvious ly there is a lot of uncerta inty, but they’re projecting\nincreases that average ar ound 100 basis points per year. Now, that’s not a promise, it’s\nconditional on their economic forecasts, and those forecasts ma y prove to be wrong and may\nchange. But at this time, the assessmen t that participants have of the economy suggest to them\nthat the appropriate pace of normalization to keep the economy on track to meet our objectives\nwill be gradual, in that sense.\n\nPETER COOK. Peter Cook with Bloom berg Television. Madam Chair , if I could, just\ngiven your discussions over the past two days with your colleag ues, the state of the economy\nright now, the improvements you’ve seen, do you think it’s stil l likely that we’ll see a rate\nincrease this year? And to fo llow on that, something Ylan ment ioned—that is, the comment\nfrom the IMF recently, earlier t his month, and the encouragemen t you got from the IMF to hold\noff on raising rates until next ye ar. Specifically, they said— your colleague Madam Lagarde\nmentioned specifically the risk— that even though there’s a risk of slight inflation by doing that,\nthat there was concern that a ra te hike could trigger market vo latility, with fin ancial stability\nconsequences that go well beyond the U.S. borders. How do you respond to those concerns?\nAre you factoring in that interna tional context to your decisio nmaking? And was it appropriate\nfor the IMF to make those kinds of specific recommendations?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Okay. So your first qu estion was about a rate i ncrease this year. You\nknow, again, the Committee tries to give an indication in the S ummary of Economic Projections\nabout how economic conditions will unfold, their best projectio ns of that and what the\nappropriate policy will be give n in light of those expectations . And, clearly, most participants\nare anticipating that a rate increase this year will be appropr iate.\nNow, that assumes, as you can s ee, that they’re expecting a pic kup in growth in the\nsecond half of this year and furth er improvement in labor marke t conditions. And we will all\nbe—we will be making decisions however that depend on the actua l data that we see in the\nmonths ahead. So, certainly, we could see data in the months a head that will justify the\nexpectations that you see in the so-called dot plot. But, agai n, the important point is, no decision\nhas been made by the Committee about what the right timing is o f an increase. It will depend on\n\nunfolding data in the months ah ead. But, certainly, an increas e this year is possible. We could\ncertainly see data that would justify that.\nIn terms the IMF guidance, you know , I believe the IMF plays a very useful role by\nundertaking reviews of the econom ic policies of all of its memb ers. Obviously, there is a range\nof opinion among outside observers a nd market participants as w ell as among the Committee’s\nparticipants, as you can see in the SEP, about how economic con ditions are likely to unfold and,\nconsequently, the appropriate ti ming of an initial rate hike. I think, however, we all agree, and\nthe IMF agrees, that policies should be data dependent, and the Committee is always doing its\nbest to assess the implicati ons of incoming data. I would poin t out that we have had incoming\ndata since that report was writt en. But, again, I want to emph asize—and I think the IMF would\nagree with this—that the impor tance of the timing of a first de cision to raise rates is something\nthat should not be overb lown, whether it’s September or Decembe r or March—what matters is\nthe entire path of rates. And, as I’ve said, the Committee ant icipates economic conditions that\nwould call for a gradual evolut ion of the fed funds rate toward normalization.\nWith respect to international sp illovers, this is something tha t we have been long attentive\nto. Obviously, we have to put in pl ace a policy that is approp riate to evolving conditions in the\nU.S. economy, but we can’t promise that there will not be volat ility when we make a decision to\nraise rates. What we can do is to do our very best to communic ate clearly about our policy and\nour expectations to avoid any type of needless misunderstanding of our policy that could create\nvolatility in the market and potential spillovers as well to em erging markets, and I have been\ntrying to do that now for some ti me. I’ve been doing my best t o make good on that pledge.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsi nger with the Associated Press. You just talked\nabout the fact that you can’t prom ise that there won’t be volat ility in the markets. There seem to\n\nbe two schools of thought. One is that the Fed learned from th e mistakes made in the—2013\nwith the taper tantrum, and tha t you’re going to telegraph this so well that that will limit it. And\nthe more pessimistic school of thought seems to be that when yo u do start raising rates, they’ve\nbeen low for so long that it’s goi ng to be—make the taper tantr um seem mild by comparison.\nWhich camp are you falling in on that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I think our experien ce suggests that it’s hard t o have great confidence\nin predicting what the market reaction will be to Fed decisions , and there have been surprises in\nthe past. I don’t think the Comm ittee anticipated that its dec ision would cause the taper tantrum.\nAnd all I can say is that uncerta inty in the markets at this po int about long-term rates doesn’t\nappear to be unusually high, and w e can only do what is in our power to attempt to minimize\nneedless volatility that could have repercussions for other cou ntries or for financial stability more\ngenerally, and that is to attempt to communicate as clearly as we can about our policy decisions,\nwhat they will depend on, and what we are looking at.\nWe will be responding to incoming data. We’ve tried to make th at clear. And I think it’s\nclear that the market is als o responding to incoming data, and you can see that in daily market\nreactions to surprises in t he economic data. And, of course, n one of us can quite forecast what\nincoming data will be.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Your latest economic projections show that you expect the\nunemployment rate—or, many officials expect the unemployment ra te—to fall more slowly this\nyear and then to fall, by impli cation, more quickly next year. Could you talk about what has\nchanged in your assessment of the labor market and how that inf luences the path of policy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we are—productiv ity growth has been—is a fact or that affects the\npace of improvement in the labor market. Productivity growth h as been extremely slow for the\n\nlast couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improve ment in the labor market that we’re\nprojecting reflects th e notion that there’s likely to be some p ickup in the pace of productivity\ngrowth. Obviously, that’s someth ing that’s quite uncertain, an d it’s conceivable that if\nproductivity growth disappoints— something I hope that we won’t see, because that has very\nnegative implications for living standards—we could conceivably see faster improvement in the\nlabor market.\nBut, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don’t s how up in the unemployment\nrate. Labor force participation that has, at least, is—appears to be depressed, at least to some\nextent, because of cyclical wea kness, and the fact that labor f orce participation rate has remained\nroughly stable for the last year or so when there’s an underlyi ng downward trend suggests that\nsome slack is being taken up by, in a sense, improved or dimini shed cyclical impact on labor\nforce participation. I expect t hat to continue, and I would ex pect also to see some improvement\nin the degree of part-time employ ment that’s for economic reaso ns.\nJONATHAN SPICER. Jonathan Spi cer with Reuters. To your point, Madam Chair, on\nneeding more decisive evidence i n order to initiate the first r ate hike, how close do you feel the\neconomy is to full capacity now ? And given that, you know, emp loyer costs and monthly wages\nare at a pace that’s at a six-y ear high now, what is the risk—o r, how does the risk change that\ninflation could strengthen qui cker than you’re expecting?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So the Committee es timates that the longer-run n ormal level of the\nunemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2. A t 5.5 percent, where we have an unemployment rate that still\nexceeds the Committee’s best attempts to estimate what is a nor mal unemployment rate for this\neconomy, and, as I mentioned, the re appear to be unusually larg e elements of slack over and\nabove that in the form of somewha t still-depressed labor force participation and part-time work\n\nfor economic reasons. So I think it ’s fair to say that most me mbers, most participants on the\nCommittee, wouldn’t judge yet—al though some might—that most wou ldn’t judge us to be at,\nquote, “maximum employment.”\nWage increases are still running a t a low level, but there have been some tentative signs\nthat wage growth is picking up. W e have seen an increase in th e growth rate of the employment\ncost index and a mild uptick in t he growth of average hourly ea rnings. I would call these\ntentative signs of stronger wag e growth. I think it’s not yet definitive, but that is a hopeful sign.\nStill, however, inflation—not onl y headline, but, stripping out food and energy\nunderlying inflation, core inflat ion—is still running below the Committee’s objective. So I think\nwe need to see additional strength in the labor market and the economy moving somewhat closer\nto capacity—the output gap shrin king—in order to have confidenc e that inflation will move back\nup to 2 percent, but we have made some progress.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb fro m MarketWatch. I’d like t o turn your\nattention to the housing market for a question. Both rents and house prices have been rising\nrapidly recently, squeezing Ame ricans on both sides. How comfo rtable are you with this, and\ndoes it impact monetary policy? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mean, the house—the increase in house pr ices is restoring\nwealth of many households who have t hat as their major asset. It is an important part of the\nwealth of American household—the A merican household sector. An d for all of the households\nthat were underwater, those house price increases are improving their financial condition,\nalthough, of course, at the same time, it’s making housing less affordable for those who look\nto buy.\n\nAt the same time, housing overall, given the low levels—still l ow level of mortgage rates,\nremains quite affordable. I thi nk credit availability remains quite constrained for mortgages.\nAnyone who doesn’t have a pristine credit rating is—finds it ve ry difficult at th is point to qualify\nfor a mortgage, and I think we’re seeing quite a bit of relucta nce, given the job market and given\nwhat the history of what’s happened to house prices, of young p eople to want to buy homes.\nWe’ve seen them delay marriage and wanting to have the flexibil ity to move. So the demand for\nmultifamily housing to rent is very high, and rent prices are m oving up, I think, because of that.\nJEREMY TORDJMAN. Hi, Jeremy To rdjman with Agence France-Presse . I have a\nquestion on Europe. As you know, the re is a growing political gridlock on Greece, and the\nscenario of a “Grexit” is getting every day more likely. So ho w concerned are you by these\ndevelopments? Do you feel it coul d impact the global and the U .S. economy, and could it\ninfluence in anywhere—in any way, sorry, when you will decide t o increase the interest rates?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well I—unfortunate ly, Greece and its creditors a re faced with very\ndifficult and consequential de cisions at this point and in the days ahead, and my hope is that they\nwill continue to work together to try to find a solution to the , you know, current difficulties and\nimpasse. Obviously, European lead ers place great value on pres erving European monetary,\neconomic, and political integrati on, and the Greek people have made clear that it’s important to\nthem to remain in the euro area . So this is a very difficult s ituation.\nIn the event that there is not agreement, I do see the potentia l for disruptions that could\naffect the European economic ou tlook and global financial marke ts. I would say that the United\nStates has very limited direct e xposure to Greece, either throu gh trade and financial—or financial\nchannels. But to the extent that there are impacts on the euro -area economy or on global\n\nfinancial markets, there would undoubtedly be spillovers to the United States that would affect\nour outlook as well.\nCHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you. C hris Condon from Bloomberg Ne ws.\nMadam Chair, I’d like to come b ack to the topic of consumer spe nding. Consumer spending has\nbeen very disappointing for ma ny months in the U.S. economy. I ’m wondering, do you think\nthere has been a meaningful shift, and one that will persist in the behavior of households, with\nrespect to spending and savings ? Or would you be more inclined to look at the recent more\nencouraging retail sales figures and see perhaps a return of th e American consumer there?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think in rece nt weeks we have received data that suggest that\nconsumer spending is growing at a moderate pace . I’d say, you know, car sales, for example,\nwere very strong. Part of it proba bly represents payback for w eak sales during the winter\nmonths, but, nevertheless, the pa ce of car sales has been stron g. And recent readings on retail\nsales and on spending on services have suggested an improvement in the pace of consumer\nspending.\nThere are questions at this poi nt about just how much impact we ’ve seen of lower energy\nprices on consumer spending. The d ecline in oil prices transla tes into an improvement in\nhousehold income, on average, of something like $700 per househ old, and I’m not convinced yet\nby the data that we have seen the kind of response to that that I would ultimately expect. And I\nthink it’s hard to know at this poi nt whether or not that refle cts a very cautious consumer that is\neager to add to savings and t o work down borrowing. Or, in par t, some survey evidence suggests\nthat consumers are not yet confid ent that the improvement they’ ve seen—the decline in their\nneed to spend for energy, for gasoline—that that’s going to be something that will be permanent.\n\nThey may think it’s a transito ry change and not yet be respondi ng. So I think the jury is out\nthere, but I think we have see n some pickup in household spendi ng.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox B usiness. Madam Chair, I want ed to shift over to\nthe decision in the AIG case this past Monday. And in it, the judge in the case said in his\nopinion, quote, “There is nothing in the Federal Reserve Act or any other federal statute that\nwould permit a Federal Reserve Ba nk to take over a private corp oration and run its business as if\nthe government were the owner, ye t that is precisely what the F ederal Reserve Bank of New\nYork did,” and the judge went on to cite the replacement of AIG ’s chief executive officer and\ntaking control of AIG’s business operations. I wanted to ask y ou, did the Fed break the law in\nassisting AIG back in the crisi s? And if this decision is uphe ld on appeal, how does that affect\nthe Fed’s toolbox? How does it a ffect its ability to help firm s in trouble in a future financial\ncrisis? Would it make that ki nd of assistance illegal, or woul d you have to get Congress to\nchange the law and make a fix? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So the Federal Res erve strongly believes that it s actions with respect\nto AIG in 2008 were legal, proper, and effective, and it believ es that they were necessary, given\nthe threat that a disorderly f ailure of that company would have likely implications for the\neconomy, for the flow of credit to households, in businesses in the economy. And it believes that\nthe—we believe that the terms of that intervention were tough, and appropriately so, in order to\nprotect taxpayers from the risks that those rescue loans presen ted at the time they were made.\nNow, I should emphasize that D odd-Frank changed our 13(3) autho rity and said that the\nFederal Reserve may not in a futur e crisis intervene to attempt to address the issues of a\nparticular company. At the same time, it gave the government a set of new tools that it could use\n\nin a situation like the AIG situ ation or Lehman to try to resol ve such a situation that poses\nsystemic risks in an orderly way.\nThe—I’d just say at this point, t he Federal Reserve under Dodd- Frank can continue, if\nnecessary, in some future crisis to engage in broad-based progr ams similar to the program we\nhad in effect—the programs we had in effect in 2008 to provide support for the issuance of asset-\nbacked securities that enabled l oans to small businesses and to students and for credit cards and,\nyou know, for credit throughout t he economy, or to support the issuance of commercial paper.\nAt this point, I believe we are w orking with the Department of Justice to decide on next steps.\nMARK HAMRICK. Madam Chair, Mark H amrick with Bankrate.com. So much\ndiscussion about rising rates s eems to focus on the potential n egatives, and I’m wondering if you\ncould talk a little b it if you envision some possible unintende d benefits of higher rates. And one\nof the things I’m thinking about i s the fact tha t savers have s uffered through so many years of\nmiserly returns, and many may be actually anticipating in a pos itive way seeing a better return on\ntheir investment. Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me say, to my mind, the most important po sitive is that it—I\nbelieve a decision to raise rates would signify very clearly th at the U.S. economy has made great\nprogress in recovering from the tr auma of the financial crisis and that we’re in a different place.\nI think, hopefully, that would be something that would be confi dence-inducing for many\nhouseholds and businesses.\nFrom the point of view of savers , of course this has been a ver y difficult period. Many\nretirees—and I hear from some a lmost every day—are really suffe ring from low rates that they\nhad anticipated would bolster the ir retirement income. This, y ou know, obviously has been one\nof the adverse consequen ces of a period of low rates.\n\nThe—you know, we have a good reason for having kept rates at th e levels that we have.\nWe—our charge from Congress is to pursue the goals of maximum e mployment and price\nstability. That’s what we’ve been doing. And obviously there are benefits from a strong\neconomy to every household in the e conomy, including savers, fr om having a better job market\nand a more secure economy. But, ye s, when the time comes for u s to raise rates, I think there\nwill be some benefits tha t flow through to savers.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times . Just to follow up on\nthat question, I think a lot of s avers, people on fixed incomes , were hopeful that they would see a\nrate increase if not this meeti ng, soon. What sort—what kind o f assurances can you give them\nand people out there who think the Fed is never going to raise rates? I’ve got some e-mails today\nfrom people saying, “They’re never going to raise rates.” What kind of assurance can you give\nto people who are waiting for that to happen?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I can’t give an i ronclad promise, but I think it ’s clear from our\nSummary of Economic Projections t hat we anticipate that the eco nomy will grow, that the labor\nmarket will improve, that inflation will move back up to 2 perc ent as we—is our objective over\nthe medium term. And if economi c conditions unfold in the way that most of my colleagues and\nI anticipate, we see it as appr opriate to raise rates. And, as you can see, the largest number of\nparticipants anticip ate that those conditi ons should be in plac e later this year.\nObviously, we have to—you know, there can be surprises—that mig ht not happen. It’s\nnot an ironclad guarantee, but we an ticipate that that’s someth ing that will be appropriate later\nthis year.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby wit h Dow Jones Newswires. Could you shed some\nadditional light on how large rev erse repo operations are likel y to be in their in itial phase? And,\n\nadditionally, how important are f inancial conditions to the pac e of the Fed’s tightening cycle? I\nmean, how important is the mark et’s reaction in determining how fast or slow and the ultimate\nendpoint of a Fed tightening cycle?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, with respect to—you asked first about overni ght reverse repos.\nAnd we communicated in our minutes that the Committee has an in tention to make sure that they\nare available—overnight repos a re available in large quantity a t liftoff to ensure that we have a\nsmooth liftoff, that there will be an elevated level of provisi on of overnight RRP. However, it is\nour expectation and plan that fair ly quickly after liftoff we w ill reduce the level of the overnight\nRRP facility, and we have a variet y of ways in which we can do that.\nWith respect to market reactions , we always, in evaluating the economic outlook, have to\ntake account of financial conditi ons, whether it’s the level of long-term interest rates or the value\nof the dollar in assessing the economic outlook. To the extent that there are market reactions and\nmarket movements, whether they’ re in reaction to decisions of o urs or in reaction to other\nevents—foreign events or unfolding economic conditions—we will always take those into\naccount in deciding on the appr opriate path of policy.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckne r of MNI. Madam Chair, good to see you. You\nmentioned that the dollar ha s stabilized. And, in fact, since mid-March, I believe it’s given up a\ngood bit of its gains from last summer. To what extent now do you think that there will be an\nongoing drag from the dollar, taki ng into account this dollar r etreat? And, overall, how\nimportant is the dollar exchange rate in monetary policy these days relative to the past?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think we s till are, since last summer—ha ve seen an\nappreciable increase in the valu e of the dollar vis-à-vis most of our trading partners, including\nemerging markets. So it is a si gnificant appr eciation of the d ollar, and I think we have seen that\n\nit’s had a negative effect on net e xports and so served as some thing of a drag on the economy,\nand probably that drag is going to c ontinue for some time to co me. So it is a factor affecting the\noutlook. In addition, import pri ces for non-oil imports contin ue to fall, and I thi nk that’s serving\nto push down core inflation a littl e bit. Eventually, I expect that impact to ebb, but it is a factor\naffecting the outlook.\nThat said, we obviously have no target for the dollar. We take movements in the dollar\nand its economic impact as one of many factors affecting the ou tlook. And, in spite of the\nappreciation of the dollar, the Committee obviou sly thinks that the economy is likely to do well\nenough to call—likely call for some tightening later this year.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker . I’d like to ask a\nregulatory question, if I could. L ast month, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman Elijah\nCummings sent a letter to the GAO asking about an inquiry into the Fed and other regulators’\nimplementation of the Communit y Reinvestment Act, a concern bei ng that the CRA, as it’s\nimplemented now, is not giving communities—blighted communities , like in Baltimore or other\nplaces—enough access to basic banking services. Do you think t hat the Fed is doing everything\nit can in its CRA implementation t o give access to those commun ities to these kinds of services?\nDo you think it needs to be doing more?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we take CRA ver y seriously and evaluate for t hose banks that we\nsupervise. We have a set of gui delines and are very conscienti ous in attempting to evaluate CRA\nperformance. It’s something tha t we certainly take into accoun t in assessing applications that we\nreceive for mergers, and we have very active programs to try to bring together community\ngroups with banking organizations t o try to provide them with i nformation about how they can\n\nassess community needs and best a ddress them. But we are looki ng at CRA and continue to look\nto see whether there are ways i n which implementation could be improved."
