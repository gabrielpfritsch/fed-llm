  "text": "Page \nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my\ncolleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 1 to 1 ¼ percent. This accommodative policy should support some\nfurther strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory o bjectives. We also decided that in October we will begin the balance sheet\nnormalization program that we outlined in June. This program will reduce our securities\nholdings in a gradual and predictable manner. I’ll have more to say about these decisions\nshortly, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook.\nAs we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter,\neconomic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Household spending has been\nsupported by ongoing strength in the job market. Business investment has picked up, and exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting improved economic conditions abroad. Overall, we expect that the economy will continue to expand at a moderat e pace over\nthe next few years.\nIn the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe\ndisruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under way, growth likely will bounce back. Ba sed on past experience, these effects are\nunlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy beyond the next couple of quarters. Of course, for the families and communities that have been devastated by the storms, recovery will take time, and on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sympathy for\nall those who have suffered losses.\n\nPage In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending\nin August —a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimate s of the pace necessary to\nabsorb new entrants to the labor force. We know from some timely indicators , such as initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance , that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in\nthe affected areas, and payroll employmen t may be substantially affected in September.\nHowever, such effects should unwind relatively quickly. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has\nstayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal level. Participation in the labor force has\nchanged little, both recently and over the past four years. Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relative ly steady\nparticipation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market. W e expect that\nthe job market will strengthen somewhat further.\nTurning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year. Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories —has also moved lower. For quite some\ntime, inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run obje ctive.\nHowever, we believe this year’s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions. For example, one -off reductions earlier this\nyear in certain categories of prices, such as wireless t elephone services, are currently holding\ndown inflation, but these effects should be transitory. Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away.\n\nPage Similarly, the recent hurricane -related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost\ninflation, but only temporarily. More broadly, with employment near assessments of its\nmaximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective. Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving\ninflation is imperf ect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the\nCommittee is monitoring inflation developments closely. As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives over the\nmedium term.\nLet me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this\nmeeting, which now extend through 2020. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate moneta ry policy , which, in turn, depend on each\nparticipant’s assessment s of the many factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for\ngrowth of inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.4 percent this year and\nabout 2 percent in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer -run rate. The median projection for the\nunemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 per cent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal\nrate. Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Compared with the projections made in June, real GDP growth is a\ntouch stronger this year , and inflation—particularly core inflation —is slightly softer this year\nand next. Otherwise, the projections are little changed from June.\n\nPage Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to\nmaintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of\nthe economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective. That expectation is based on our\nview that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level —that is, the level that\nis neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion. Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of\nthe federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\nThis view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of nex t year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 2.9 percent in 2020. Compared with\nthe projections made in June, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged, although the median estimate of the longer -run normal value edged down to 2.8 percent.\nAs always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their\nassessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks. Policy is not on a preset course.\nAs I noted, the Committee announced today that it will begin its balance sheet\nnormalization program in October. This program, which was described in the June addendum to\nour Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually decrease our reinvestments of\n\nPage proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities. As a\nresult, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably. For October through December,\nthe decline in our securities holdings will be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and\n$4 billion per month for agencies. These caps will gradually rise over the course of the\nfollowing year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month\nfor agency securities and will remain in place through the process of normalizing the size of our\nbalance sheet. By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as\nwe reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outs ized moves in interest rates and other\npotential market strains.\nFinally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate\nis our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Our balance sheet is not\nintended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times. We therefore do not plan on\nmaking adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program. But, of course, as we stated in\nJune, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a materi al deterioration in the\neconomic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.\nThank you. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nCHRISTOPHER CONDON. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Chair Yellen, there ’s\nbeen extraordinary progress during your term as Chair in lowering several measures of\nunemployment and underemployment , and all while inflation has remained subdued. B ut some\npeople are even asking , why stop there ? Bill Spriggs , the chief economist at the AFL -CIO, who\nI think you know well, criticized the F ed last week for seeking to maintain unemployment above\n4 percent , which he notes necessarily means keeping the unemployment rate among black\nAmericans above 8 percent . He described this as a deliberate policy to sacrifice many h undreds\n\nPage of thousands of potential workers and their families out of fear of future inflation, when in fact\nthe Fed ’s preferred measure of inflation has not exceed ed 3 per cent in more than 25 years. So\nI’m wondering how you would respond to his frustration over the Fed ’s desire to continue\nraising rates when core inflation really shows no sign of heading above the Fed ’s symmetric goal\nfor inflation. Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our\nmandate. We ’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have\ntaken that very seriously. I’m very pleased and heartened by the i mprovement we have seen in\nthe labor market, and at 4.4 percent, t he unemployment rate has really fallen to quite a low level.\nAs that ’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor m arket ,\nparticularly African Americans and Hispanics, ha s fallen more dramatically than that for the\nnation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the\nfinancial crisis and G reat R ecession hit. A nd these are really very positive development s. So we\ncertainly seek a strong labor m arket, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and\nunemployment , and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a 2 percent inflation\nobjective over the medium term.\nNow, I recognize and it ’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent\nobjective for a number of years , and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into\nlower inflation expectations. For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor m arket —which , my judgment\nwould be , has largely disappeared —very large reductions in energy prices , and a large\nappreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid -2014. This year, the\n\nPage shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative , is more of a\nmystery, and I will not say that the C ommittee clearly understands what the causes are of that.\nNow, we do , in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of\nforecast errors . All of the variables —GDP, t he unemploymen t rate , and inflation —are forecast\nby ourselves and private forecasters with errors , and so there is variation in these economic\nvariables fro m year to year. I would say our judgment , as I said in the statement, is that the\nshortfall is not largely relate d to cyclical considerations. You can see from the projections that\nthe C ommittee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will\nmove up close to our 2 percent objective next year —namely , that the shortfall this year is du e to\ntransitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year .\nBut I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent .\nAnd as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants wr ite down about the\npath of the federal funds r ate, they are not set in stone . They are not definite plans. We will look\nat incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor m arket , in\ndeciding what we should actually do going f orward . And if it proves contrary to our\nexpectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to\naddress that. But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below\n2 percent, whic h we need to take account of in monetary policy , monetary policy also operates\nwith a lag. And experience suggests that tightness in the labor market , gradually and with a lag,\ntends to push up wage and price inflation, and that ’s also a risk , that we want to be careful not to\nallow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere do wn the road,\nto have to tighten m onetary policy rapidly , which could cause a recession a nd threaten the very\ndesirable labor m arket conditio ns that we have now.\n\nPage SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . The\nFed’s staff spoke recently about elevated asset prices in the mark ets in the most recent —in the\nmeeting before th is one held today. How are buoyant market conditions affecting the debate at\nthe moment about how quickly to rein in stimulus? And have they , in your own mind, helped to\ncounter some of the concerns you’ve had about the inflation s hortfalls that we ’ve been seeing ?\nThanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So at every meeting we try to assess the economic o utlook and take\naccount of information that ’s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments\nin financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy. So\ndevelopments affecting asset prices and longer -term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of\nthose aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking .\nBut it’ s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall\noutlook. Sometimes mo vements —upward movements in asset prices can, for example, reflect a\nchange in market participants ’—reduction in market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run\nlevel of interest rates. So there has been —there have been downward revisions both to the\nCommittee ’s and to market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal level of interest\nrates , which in turn reflects in some sense a view that , going out many years , aggregate demand\nglobally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growt h and aging populations .\nAnd, of course , we don’ t know if that view is correct, but that ’s a factor that could be reflected —\ncould be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have. So , you know, why are asset\nprices moving ? That’s important in dete rmining the impact on the overall outlook, but , certainly ,\nwe are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy.\n\nPage STEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman , CNBC. Madam C hair, you just said in your\nopening remarks that reducing the balance sheet sh ould not be “ an active tool for monetary\npolicy in normal times, ” you don’ t plan to make adjustments to the balance sheet . I’m\nwondering if we could explore if there ’s any sensitivity to the plan you just announced if there ’s\na spike in interest rates, a plunge i n the stock market, weakness in growth.\nIn the June statement , you indicated that the only reason why you would change the —it\nsuggested the only reason you’d change the balance sheet is if it required , first , a change i n the\nfunds rate. Is that true ? If there ’s some unexpected development in markets , or, for example,\ngiven that we don’ t know what the plans are on the fiscal side for the deficit in terms of tax\ncuts—there could be a sudden spike in the deficit —will the balance sheet reduction plan be\nimmune to all of that ? And, given t hat question, and the idea that this has never been done\nbefore, why so much certainty about the plan you’ve just announced and apparent unwillingness\nto adjust it?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use: the\nbalance sheet and adjustments in short -term interest rates —our federal funds rate target . And,\nhistorically , the C ommittee has operated t o adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic\ngoals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting the federal funds r ate—our short -term\ninterest rate target. And that ’s something —a technique of monetary control that we have used\nfor a very long time that we are familiar with, we believe we understa nd pretty well what the\neffects are on the economy, market participants understand how that tool has been used and\nwould likely be adjusted in response to shocks to the economy . And our preference is , when we\nhave two different tools that we could use to actively adjust the stance of policy, to prefer and to\nmake a commitment that, to t he maximum extent possible , the federal funds r ate will be the\n\nPage active tool of policy. That ’s our go- to tool . That is what we intend to use unless we think that\nthe threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate—\nafter all , we’ve moved it up to 1 to 1¼ percent and expect it to go up further —but a very\nsignificant negativ e shock to the economy could conceivably force us bac k to the so- called zero\nlower bound. We have said if there were that type of material deterioration in the o utlook where\nwe cou ld face a situation where the federal funds r ate isn ’t a su fficient tool fo r us to adjust\nmonetary p olicy, we might stop—we might stop r oll-offs from our balance sheet and resume\nreinvestment . But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool , that is\nwhat we intend to do.\nSo, if there are small changes in the outlook t hat require a recalibration of monetary\npolicy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not , for\nexample, change the caps on reinvestment or stop —continue reinvestment for a few months and\nthen change it. We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be , will be less confusing and more eff ective in terms of conducting\npolicy.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum , the New York Times . You have now\ncommitted to a policy of reducing your balance sheet very gradually. You have described plans to raise interest rates even more gradually than previously. You are locked in for a long period of time to a forecast that monetary p olicy will essentiall y keep interest rates at a low level and\nkeep a balance sheet at a high level. If something goes wrong , does the F ed have room to\nrespond under these conditions in the next several years , and could you describe for us what your\nplans are for a response , should it be warranted?\n\nPage CHAIR YELLEN. So the only t hing I would object to there , is you said that we are\n“locked in,” and I would say that we are not locked in. We believe that economic conditions will\nevolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if\nconditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be —it mig ht be that\ngrowth is more rapid, t he labor m arket tightens more quickly than we assume, an d inflation\nappears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected —we have not promised, no matter\nwhat, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual. We believe that that will be\nappropriate , but we always watching the economy and will adjust policy as appropriate.\nNow, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet , in some\nsense , is high. If conditions were to weaken, we would really only consider resuming\nreinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration , and I tried to explain why\nthat is . But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy . What you see in the dot plot is each\nparticipant ’s best guess, based on the information they have today , about what will be\nappropriate in light of their expectations about how the econom y would evolve . And we think\nit’s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the\neconomy . But we ’re assessing incoming data, and these p lans are subject to change. W hat’s not\nsubject to change is our commitmen t to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that\nCongress has assigned to u s, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum\nemployment.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM . Do you, in fact , have room in the next two or three years to\nrespond to an economic downturn?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So , certainly , if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more\nrapidly , we have room. We have a certain amount of room now , and we have raised the funds\n\nPage rate four times. We believe that we are on a path where ther e will likely be further increases\nover the next couple of years, which will give us greater room , and we think the recovery is on a\nstrong track. So the reason for our actions today in beginning to run down the balance sheet is,\nwe think the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook for the real economy . But, of course , there are shocks , and if the negative shock to the economy were\nsufficient, we recognize that we might be unable to pursue objective s purely by cutting the\nfederal funds r ate, and that is why we say explicitly that we would be prepared , in that event, to\nresume reinvestment , and other tools that we used in the financial crisis —forward guidance —\nwould also be available to us.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timiraos of the Wall S treet Journal . Chair Yellen , Fed\nGovernor Lael Brainard recently gave a speech in which she said trend inflation appeared to\nhave moved lower by around ½ percentage point. I wanted to ask , do you agree? And what\nwould the F ed need to do , if anything , to boost trend inflation if it has fallen? And , related to\nthat, you’ve said you expect the inflation softness this year to prove “ transitory. ” Compared to\nthree months ago, how firm is your curr ent expectation that the slowdown will remain transitory ,\nand what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is not?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So the term “ trend inflation ”—usually there are a variety of statistical\ntechniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series. Exactly what that means is, in some\nsense , a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in\nrecent year s in the trend. After all, we’ve had a numbe r of years in which inflation has been low.\nAs I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you g o back to, s ay, 2013 and consider the —\nuntil this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand. It’s a combination\n\nPage of slack in the labor m arket, declines in energ y prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down\nimport price inflation.\nSo what ’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations. By\nsome —by many—by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock\nsolid. We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some. Market -based\nmeasures of inflation c ompensation, as we mentioned in the statement —they have declined, and\nthey’ve been stable in recent months, but they ’ve declined to levels that are low by historical\nstandards. That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’ t get a\nclear read —the re are risk premia built into inflation c ompensation that make it impossible to\nextract directly what inflation expectations are.\nSo, you know, there is a miss this year . I can ’t say I can easily poin t to a sufficient set of\nfactors that explain this year why inflation has been this low. I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic\nthings, but , frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things. The fact\nthat inflation is unusually l ow this year does not mean that that ’s going to continue. Remember\nthat in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12- month basis at around 1.9\npercent, and we look to be very close to 2 now. We ’ve had several months of data that have\nmeaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is figure out whether or not the factors\nthat have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they ’re likely to prove transitory, and\nthat’s what we ’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data .\nAnd you asked me about the policy implications. Of course, if we determined our view\nchanged, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory , we came\nto the view that they would be persistent, it would re quire an alteration in monetary policy to\nmove inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment.\n\nPage ANN SAPHIR . Hi, Ann Saphir with Reuters. I wanted to ask you, market s seem to be\npricing in still a shallow er path of rate hikes than the F ed does in the SEP, and I wonder , what do\nyou think that markets might be missing here , and, sort of , what ’s your conviction about, you\nknow, that your view is the correct one on the gradual —the pace that “ gradual ” means, which\nseems to be a little bit faster than what markets are pricing?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I ’m not really going to try to explain what market participants are\nthinking. I thin k all of us —both market and FOM C participant s’ paths have come down. N ot in\nthe last couple of quart ers, but over the last several years , there’ s been a growing recognition that\nthe so -called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum\nemployment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and\nresearch bearing on this topic suggest that it ’s quite low.\nMarket —SEP —the FOMC participants —you can see by their estimates of the longer -run\nnormal rate of interest, it is —this time it came down from—the median came down from 3\npercent to 2.75 percent. So that shows that even in the long run, FOM C participants, in light of\nincoming data, are adjusting their views. I would say they still believe that, in real terms, that\nneutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years . With a 2 percent inflati on rate , that\nlong-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or\nslightly positive rates now. So that ’s one factor that explains the path in the SEP. Market\nparticipants may have lower estimates or believe that a low neutral rate may be more persistent.\nI mean, let me emphasize that , as I said before, there’ s nothing set in stone about the\npolicy paths that you see in the summary of projections . There’ s a great deal of uncertainty\naround them. Not only is there disagreement, th ere’s also uncertainty, and FOM C participants\nhave been revising their views over time, and they wi ll continue to do so.\n\nPage I’d also point out a couple of technical reasons why it ’s difficult to compare what you see\nin the SEP and marke t-implied paths. One is that FOM C participants are writing down what\nthey think is the most likely , or modal , outcome for rates . But, of course , there are downside\nrisks . And the mean rate , if they were asked to write that down, would take account of weighing\nall possible outcomes and likely would be lower than what participants are writing down as the ir\nmost likely outcome. In addition, in markets , many economists have suggested that there are\nterm premia that can affect moving from the so -called market -implied path to the view for what\nthe future federal funds rate path is, and if those term premia are negative , as many economists\nthink they likely are, there ’s a little bit less difference between what you see in the FOMC plot\nand the market -implied plot.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Thanks. Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times . Chair Yellen,\nyour term expires as C hair in February . Have you had a chance to meet with or discuss your\nsituation with Pr esident Trump yet? And if so, what were your impressions of him and what he ’s\nlooking for from the Federal Reserve?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I have said that I intend to serve out my term as C hair, and that\nI’m really not going to comment on my intentions beyond that. I will say that I have not had a\nfurther meeting with President Trump. I met with him early in my term, and I ’ve not had a\nfurther meeting with him.1\nADAM SHAPIRO. Adam Shapiro, Fox Business. Chair Yellen , a month ago you\ndelivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, “T he balance of research suggests that the\ncore reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting\ncredit availability or economic growth. ” I have a two-part question based on that quote. First,\n\n1 Chair Yellen intended to say that she met with President Trump early in his term.\n\nPage what message do you want Congress and President Trump to hear from that statement? And\nthen, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the F ed has followed for the\nlast 10 years has helped bri ng us to full employment, but economists point out that there have\nbeen people who haven ’t benefited . For instance , 52 percent of Americans own stock , 48\npercent don ’t—they’ve not participated in the gains in the stock market. Housing prices —the\nmedian h ouse price is now at a record high, and 39 million Americans , according to a Harvard\nstudy, spend more than 30 percent for housing. So what would you say to those people about Fed policies and the impact they ’ve had on their lives?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Okay. So you asked me , what was the main —first , what was the\nmain message of my speech, and I would say it ’s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a\nset of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and , in my personal view, it ’s\nimpor tant they remain in place . And those core reforms are more capital, higher -quality capital,\nmore liquidity —especially in systemically important banking institutions —stress testing, and\nresolution plans . And those four prongs of improvements in banking supervision have really\nstrengthened the financial system and made it more resilient, and I believe they should stay in place.\nBut I also tried to emphasize —and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the\navailability of credit. I’ve also tried t o emphasize that all regulators should be attentive to undue\nregulatory burden and look for ways to try to scale that back. A nd this is especially true after\nyears in which we have implemented a large number of complex regulations, and we have been\ncommitted to doing that. I would point out particularly community banks that are laboring under\nsignificant regulatory burden. W e have been looking for ways to scale back burdens, running the\nEGRPRA process , where we ’ve listened to concerns among community banks and are looking\n\nPage for ways, for example , to simplify capital standards and reduce burdens, and that ’s very\nimportant.\nMore generally, we want to tailor —we want to , and we would like to see Congress as\nwell—we can do things to appropriately tailor regulati ons to the risk posed by different kinds of\nbanking organizations. There are some things that Congress could also do to help that process,\nand we have made some concrete suggestions . And then some of the regulations that we have\nput in place with other regulators since the crisis, like the Volcker rule, are really quite complex,\nand we ’re working —we believe we should —and we ’re working with other regulators to try to\nsee if we can find ways , while carrying out what Dodd- Frank intended, that banking\norganizations not be involved in proprietary trading . Nevertheless , the implementation can be\nless complex. So that was my main message.\nYour second questi on asked about what impact the F ed has had on income distribution\nbecause of the fact that stocks and homes tend to be disproportionate ly owned . So, I would say ,\nlook, we were faced with a huge recession that took an enormous toll in terms of depriving large\nnumbers of people —and disproportionatel y lower -income people who are less advantaged in the\nlabor m arket —found themselves without work. We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and\nour congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability. So we set monetary policy not with a view tow ard affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those\ncongressionally mandated goals .\nAnd I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of\npertaining to the labor m arket show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely\nimportant to the economic well- being not at the top end of the wealth and income distribution,\n\nPage but to the bottom end of the income distribution . And w e have seen this year median income in\nreal terms rise significantly , with gains throughout the income distribution.\nMART IN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger , Associated Press. Madam Chair, the next\nmonth, with the departure of Vice Chair Fis cher, the Fed ’s going to lose its quorum —the F ed\nBoard—you’ll go to three members. Do you have —is that going to present operational\nchallenges for you? Do have contingency plans? Has the Senate assured you that Mr. Quarles\nwill be —his confirmation will be approved? And in your discussions with the Administration,\nhave they given you any assurances that the pace of nominations is going to pick up soon?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So first let me say that I will greatly miss Vice Chair Fis cher. He ’s\nmade enormous contributions to t he FOMC and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and\nI have real ly enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship. It is\nconceivable that we will be down to three Governors. I have full confidence that even if that\nhappens, we will be able to carry out our compleme nt of responsibilities. Th ere’s—every action\nthat we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a B oard\nof three , although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part of the\nGovernment in the Sunshine Act.\nI would welcome a full complement of colleagues. We have a lot of work to do, and it\nwould be nice to distribute it over more people . But, perhaps more important than that, I think\nit’s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we deliberate on policy\nactions. I’ve had very good interactions with Randy Quarl es and hope he will be confirmed. I\nlook forward to working with him , and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make\nother nominations to fill our slots.\n\nPage HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post . As you know, Congress is\nconsidering a major tax reform package. Do you or any of the C ommittee members have\nconcerns if that package does not end up being deficit neutral and ends up adding to the debt?\nWould t hat be problematic for the economy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Look, that ’s something that ’s a matter for Congress and the White\nHouse to decide. You know, I ’ve put forward a few principles about fiscal policy that I would\nreiterate, that one of the problems that the American economy suffers from, along with many\nother economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth. We do face, in terms of longer -term deficits as the population ages, an\nunsustainable debt path that will require, I beli eve, some adjustments to fiscal p olicy, and I hope\nCongress will keep that in mind . But beyond a few core principles, it ’s really —I don’ t want to\nweigh in on details.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Mars hall-Genzer from Marketplace. When\nyou testified before Congress last July, you said that you might be prepared to take enforcement actions against Wells Fargo if it proved to be appropriate. Do you think it ’s appropriate, and\nwhat actions could you take?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me say that I consider the behavior of Wells Fargo towards its\ncustomers to have been egregious and unacceptable. We take our supervision responsibilities at the company very seriously, and we are attempting to understand what the root causes of those problems a re and to address them . I’m not able to discuss confidential supervisory information\nand not yet able to tell you what actions we may take, but I do want to say that we are committed\n\nPage to taking the actions we regard as necessary and appropriate to make sur e that the right set of\ncontrols are in place in that organization.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Can you give me any kind of a timeline?\nCHAIR YELLEN. We are working very hard on it .\nDAVID HARRISON. Hi, thank you. David Harrison with Dow Jones. I’d like to follow\nup on the balance s heet question , if I may. What specifically would it take for you to reverse the\ndecision to wind down the balance s heet, and under what conditions would you consider adding\nto the balance s heet again ? And s eparately , as a follow -up to that, looking more broadly, how do\nyou think history will judge the effectiveness of your asset purchases an d the conditions under\nwhich that policy should be used? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So , starting with the last part of the question, I mean, my own\njudgment, based on my experience and the economic research that has tried to estimate the\neffectiveness of our balance s heet actions starting in 2008 and has also looked at the similar\nbalance s heet actions in other parts of the world, including the euro area, is that these actions\nwere successful in making financial conditions more accommodative and , I believe, in\nstimulating a faster recovery than we otherwise would ha ve had . A recent Fed working paper\nestimated that the full set of balance s heet actions that we took during the crisis may have\nlowered long -term interest rates by about 100 basis points. O bviously , there are different —there\nare different estimates around—of what difference it made, but I would say that it ’s effective.\nIt will b e up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether\nthey think it ’s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet —to adding assets to a balance sheet. I\nwould say that if economists are correct that we’ re living in a world w here the level of neutral\ninterest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future\n\nPage due to slow productivity growth and demographics —now , we don’ t know that that view will\nbear out to be correct, but it is a view th at many people adhere to when there is evidence of it —\nthen future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn\nwhere they ’re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting\novernight interest rates, what other actions are available to them ?\nAnd during the crisis , we bought longer -term assets and used forward guidance, and for\nmy own part, I would want to keep those things in the toolkit as being available. It will be up to\nfuture policymakers to decide how to rank those, or whether or not there might be other options\nthat are available to them, but I don’ t think this issue will go away, although perhaps it ’s only —\nwell, this could well be a decision that future policymakers will have to face in the event of a\nsignificant asset —economic shock.\nI mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can’ t really\nsay much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material\ndeterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a situation where\nwe would need to substantially cut the f ederal f unds r ate and could be limited by the so -called\nzero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our C ommittee is saying would —might\nlead us to resume reinvestment.\nSo that ’s—our C ommittee has been unanimous in affirming this statement of intentions,\nso, y ou know, I think that ’s where our C ommittee stands . So that is a somewhat high bar to\nresume reinvestments, and that ’s why , in answering previous questions, I would say , well, yo u\nknow, if there’s some small, negative shock, our first tool —our most import ant and reliable\ntool—will be the federal funds r ate. B ut if there is a significant shock that’s a material\ndeterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment.\n\nPage VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi , Chair Yellen . Victoria Guida with Politico. You ’ve been on\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council for a few years now, and I was wondering if you had\nany thoughts on whether the designation process for S ystemically Important F inancial\nInstitutions should be changed or improved in any way . And a somewh at separate, but related ,\nquestion: The situation with Equifax —I was wondering if there ’s anything related to that that\nmight raise systemic issues that FSOC would need to discuss.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So you asked first about the designation process. So during the time\nthat I ’ve been on the FSOC, only one firm was —several firms were designated before I\nparticipated. MetLife was designated during the time that I was there, and I have seen how the\ndesignation process works.\nI do think designation is important. We saw during the financial crisis that some\nsystemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG —that their distress\nproduce d broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U .S. economy . And having the\nability to designate firms wh en the FSOC makes the determination that their distress or failure\ncould have systemic repercussions, I believe that ’s an important —that ’s an important policy tool\nfor FSOC to have available.\nNow, it’ s not meant to be a one -way street , in the sense that a firm that ’s designated —the\nprocedures require annual reviews. Firms may change their business models or just how they conduct their business, and we should welcome de -designation of firms if their business model is\nchanged in a way that leads us to believe that their failure or distress would no longer be systemically important and those are decisions that we make every year.\nSo, you know, I ’m satisfied with that process so far. GE Capital dramatically changed its\nbusiness model and was de- designated , and, you know, I believe it ’s a process that works. So I\n\nPage know that the T reasury is looking at this and may make recommendations, and if they do, I’d be,\nyou know, glad to consider them as, you know, part of the FSOC process, but I think it ’s been\nimporta nt and basically working.\nYou asked about Equifax and, you know , of course that is a very serious data breach. We\nwould really urge consumers now to be very careful in monitoring their credit reports and\nfinancial situation . And, through our supervision, we’re working with the banks that we\nsupervise to make sure that they take appropriate actions with respect to their business processes in light of the fact that there could be breaches or fraudulent transactions or information that they received that the y might use —for example, in credit determinations —could be contaminated by\nbad data . More generally, it points to the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and\nattention to cybersecurity risks, which we do see as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector . And we are very focused in our banking supervision in making sure that banks\nhave appropriate controls in place . And the Equifax breach, I think, highlights the importance\nof that.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Telev ision and Radio. We ’ve\ntalked a lot today about what you ’re going to do and what you may do, but not necessarily about\nwhy. With four rate increases behind you, financial conditions are looser than before you began. And I’m wondering if that bothers you, if you’ re concerned about overstimulating the economy,\nor if you feel inflation could break out much more quickly than we have seen, or if you feel there’ s a financial stability question because stocks, bonds, and real estate are all so expensive\nnow. How would you explain what the Fed is doing, why the F ed is doing it , to the American\npeople?\n\nPage CHAIR YELLEN. So , first of all , let me say that the decisions that we ’ve made this year\nabout rates and today about our balance sheet are ones we’ ve taken because we feel the U .S.\neconomy is performing well. We are working down our balance sheet because we feel that ’s\nstimulus that in some sense is no longer needed. So the basic message here is , U.S. economic\nperformance has been good . The labor m arket has st rengthened subst antially. Every measure of\nthe labor m arket, whether it ’s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate,\nthe number of people working in part -time jobs who want full -time work, the level of job\nopenings, the quit rate, the di fficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of\nconfidence we see in surveys about the labor m arket —all of that is pointing to vast and\nconti nuing improvement in the labor m arket .\nAnd we see sufficient strength in the economy , in terms of spending —that grow th, with\nits ups and downs, but nevertheless is strong enough—looks to be strong enough in the medium\nterm to support ongoing improvement in the labor m arket . And all of that is good, and I think\nthat the American people sho uld feel the steps we ’re tak ing to normalize monetary policy are\nones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we ’ve seen in the\neconomy.\nNow, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we ’ve talked about that a lot\nduring this —the last hour. This past year , where it’s not clear what the reasons are— I think it ’s\nnot been mysterious in the past, but , one way or another , we have had four or five years in which\ninflation is running below our 2 percent objective , and we are also committed to achieving that.\nSo the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in\nour projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that\n\nPage we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 per cent and to maintain a strong labor\nmarket on a sustainable basis .\nAnd in making these judgments about the path of policy, we have to balance various\nrisks. One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that , although we don ’t\nthink this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that’ s going to be persistent . And if we\ntighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance —leave it at too low a level —\ninflation expectations could fall , and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous.\nAnd so that ’s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is.\nBut, on the other hand, we have a strong labor m arket and a low unemployment rate .\nAnd al though the pace of job gains is not quite as strong this year as , for example, as it was in\n2016, we ’re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of\nmaybe 100 to 120,000 that would be consistent with a stable unemp loyment rate if labor force\nparticipation begins to move down in the manner we expect.\nSo if we don’ t do anything to remov e policy accommodation, and the labor m arket\ntightens and just continues to tighten , as you mentioned, arguably —we could, you know —\narguably , financial conditions overall haven’ t tightened that much . We think the economy could\noverheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective . That’s something that\nwould occur with a lag, and that would force us later on to tighten pol icy more rapidly than\nwould be ideal, and we could risk a recession if we did that.\nSo there are risks on both sides to our objectives, and most of my colleagues and I have\nconclu ded that a gradual path of rate increases —while constantly watching incoming data, being\nopen to revising our views on the outlook, and revising our expectations about policy —is the\nbest way to manage that set of risks."
