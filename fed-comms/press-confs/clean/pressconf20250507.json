  "text": "Page \nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.\nThe unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer -\nrun objective.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. I will have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [Cough] Pardon me.\nFollowing growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the\nfirst quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in imports ahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last quarter. Private domestic purchases, or PDFP —which excludes net exports, inventory\ninvestment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the\nsame as last year ’s pace. Within PDFP, growth of consum er spending moderated while\ninvestment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.\n\nPage In the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged\n155,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains\nlow and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate ,\nwhile still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pre ssures.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid -2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer- run goal. Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the\n12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. Near -term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in\nboth market - and survey -based measures. Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,\nand professional forecasters, point to tariffs as t he driving factor. Beyond the next year or so,\nhowever, most measures of longer -term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation goal.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today ’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent and to\ncontinue reducing the size of the balance sheet.\nThe new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in\nfour distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. The tariff increases\nannounced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated. All of these policies are still evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain. As eco nomic\nconditions evolve, we ’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based\non the incoming data, the outlook, and the bal ance of risks.\n\nPage If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to\ngenerate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.\nThe effects on inflation could be short lived , reflecting a one -time shift in the price level . It is\nalso possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent . Avoiding that\noutcome will depend on the size of the tariffs ’ effect —tariff effects, on how long it takes for\nthem to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer -term inflation\nexpectations well anchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent\na one -time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to\nmeet that obligation, we ’ll balance our maximum -employment and price -stability mandates,\nkeeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.\nWe may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual -mandate goals are\nin tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. For the time being, we ’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any\nadjustments to our policy stance.\nAt this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five -year review\nof our monetary policy framework. We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for our monetary policy strategy. Our review includes outreach and public eve nts involving a wide\nrange of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next week. Throughout this process, we ’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take\non board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.\n\nPage The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well a nchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do ever ything we can to achieve our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my\nquestion. A lot has happened since the last meeting. There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken off, and meanwhile , there was a bill advancing in Congress. And I just wonder if I could press\nyou on the last part of your statement. Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the\nmandate is going to need urgent care first?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so , as we noted in our —in our statement —postmeeting\nstatement, we’ ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.\nAnd this, by the way, of course, is compared to March. So that ’s what we can say. I don’ t think\nwe can say, you know, which way this will shake out. I think there ’s a great deal of uncertainty\nabout, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also , when they do settle\nout, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment. I think it ’s\ntoo early to know that. So, I mean, ultimately , we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place\nto stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and , ultimately , their implications for the economy.\n\nPage STEVE LIESMAN. Hearing you describe what you’ re looking for in terms of being able\nto make a decision, it sounded like that ’s a long- term process before you sound like you’ re going\nto be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable , to act on what the data ’s telling you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t think we know. You know, I think—look where we are\ntoday. W e have an economy that , if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1\nGDP, you’ ve still got an economy that looks like it’ s growing at a solid pace. The labor market\nappears to be solid. Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent. So it’s an economy that ’s\nbeen resilient and is in good shape , and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.\nIt’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall. And so we think that leaves us in a good\nplace to wait and see. We don’ t think we need to be in a hurry. We think we can be patient.\nWe’re going to be watching the data. The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think\nwe’re in a good position , where we are, to , to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of\nwhat should be the monetary policy response.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos for t he Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, there ’s\nnaturally a lot of [ inaudible ] around 2021 in supply shocks. But there are some who argue that\nthe current situation has notable differences . Energy costs are down. H ousing imbalances look\nnothing like they did four years ago. L abor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage\ngrowth running below 4 percent. What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation\nbeyond a rise in goods prices this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the underlying inflation picture is , is good. I t’s what you see,\nwhich is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent. And we ’ve had basically decent readings\nin housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it. So that part , I think is , is\nmoving along well.\n\nPage But there ’s just so much that we don’ t know. I think —and we ’re in a good position to\nwait and see, is the thing . We don’ t have to be in a hurry. The economy is —has been resilient\nand is doing fairly well. Our policy is well positioned. T he cost s of waiting to see further are\nfairly low, we think. So that ’s what we ’re doing. And , you know, we’ll, we ’ll see . The\nAdministration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs. We’ ll know more\nwith each week and month that goes by where —about where tariffs are going to land —you\nknow, land, and we ’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things. So we\nthink we ’ll be learning. I can ’t tell you how long it will take. But, for now, it does seem like\nit’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So when you say that you don’ t need to be in a hurry, does that mean\nthat—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as\nsoon as your next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, as I said, we ’re—we are comfortable with our policy\nstance. We think the right—we ’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve. We\ndon’t feel like we need to be in a hurry. We feel like it ’s appropriate to be patient. And , you\nknow, when things develop—of course , we have a record of —we can move quickly when that ’s\nappropriate. But we think right now , the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things\nevolve. There ’s so much uncertainty. If you talk to businesses or market participants or\nforecasters, everyone is just —is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we ’ll be\nable to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is. So we ’re\nnot in that place, and, you know, as that develops —and I can ’t really give you a time frame\non that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\n\nPage JONN ELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So , many economists have been\npricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to\ncut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation. So , given the outlook, do you\nstill see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say —I mean, so let ’s, let’s, let’s look back and see\nwhere we are. So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day. W e’ve had —we’ve had, you know,\nunemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we ’ve had inflation coming down in the —now\nin the mid -to-low 2s, and we ’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent. So that is —that is the\neconomy as we see it now. What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we will see the —certainly , the risk s to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased. And\nif that’ s what we do see, if —and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we\ndon’t know, then, then we will see —we won ’t see further progress toward our goals, but we\nmight see a delay in that. I think in the —you know, in our thinking, we would get —we would\nnever —we never do anything but keep achieving those goals. But what we would —at least for\nthe next, let ’s say , year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,\nif that is —if that ’s the way the tariffs shake out. The thing is, we don’ t know that. There ’s so\nmuch uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistenc e of the tariffs. So that ’s that. In\nterms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive. I wouldn’ t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive. If anything, it was a little late. But\n2019, we did cut three times. But the situation was , you had a weakening economy, and you had\ninflation at 1.6 percent. So that ’s a situation where you can move preemptively. Now we have\ninflation running above target. It has been above target for four years. It’s not so far above\ntarget now. And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that w e’ll see upward\npressure on inflation. If you look at where forecasters are, they ’re all forecasting an increase in\n\nPage inflation. So it makes it —and then we ’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the\neconomy, and some have recession forecast s. We don’ t make a—we don’t make —publish a\nforecast about , about that. We don’ t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.\nBut, in any case, it ’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don ’t\nknow what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Colby Smith with t he New York Times. How much weakness does the\nCommittee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower\ninterest rates again? Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of\ntime, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports? I mean, how are you making\nthat assessment?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so first of all, we don’ t see that yet, right ? W e have\n4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I\nmentioned, at a good level. So , you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of\nthe—of the data. We ’d look at the level of the unemployment rate . We’d look at the speed with\nwhich it ’s changing. W e would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to , to get a\nsense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not. And , at the same time, we ’d be\nlooking at the other side of the mandate. We could be in a position of having to balance those two things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we ’d have to make.\nCOLBY SMITH. On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ ve mentioned that the\nCommittee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to\nkind of get back to that point. But what does that mean in practice? I mean, how much of that assessment will be rooted in a forecast , versus data dependence?\n\nPage CHAIR POWELL. It would be a combination of the two. I mean, let ’s just say this is\na—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if —and\nthis is —we ’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension. So let ’s say\nthat unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation\nwe’re in—hypothetically. B ut we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’ re\nexpected to be from the goals, what ’s the expected time to get back to their goals. We ’d look at\nall those things and make a difficult judgment. And that ’s in our framework. It’ s always been in\nour thinking. You know, it ’s—we haven ’t had—we haven ’t faced that question in a very long\ntime. And so, again, difficult , difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today. A nd\nwe may never face it . But , you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So we had\nthe CPI report that came out that showed , month over month, the first increase in inflation in\nabout three years. T he jobs report —you said “ solid ”—that we saw. At the same time, we have\nthose new tariffs that we ’re living under. So , given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting\nrates at all this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it ’s going to depend. I think you have to just take a step\nback and realize this is— this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to\nsee how this evolves. There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn ’t, and we just don’ t know. Until we know more about\nhow this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and for, for inflation, I couldn’ t confidently s ay that I know what the appropriate path will be.\n\nPage EDWARD LAWRENCE. So , following on that, just, you know —so then how does\nPresident Trump calling on you personally as well as the Federal Reserve to make rate cuts affect\nyour decision today and affect your job difficulty?\n[0:18:00]\nCHAIR POWELL. Doesn ’t affect our—doing our job at all. So we —you know, we ’re\nalways going to do the same thing— which is , we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum\nemployment and price stability for the benefit of the American people. We ’re always going to\nconsider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks . And that ’s it, that’s all we’ re\ngoing to consider. So it really doesn ’t affect either our job or the way we do it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi . Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.\nI’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first -quarter GDP and what lies ahead,\nI’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy\nright now. Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing. If so, do you have\nany sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be? What does your gut tell you about how things are evolving out there?\nCHAIR POWELL. My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is\nextremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased. The risk is —as we\npointed out in our statement, the risks —the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation\nhave risen, but they haven’ t materialized yet. They really haven’ t. They ’re not , really not in the\ndata yet, so that —and that tells me more than by intuition because I think —I think it’s obvious,\nactually, that the right thing for us to do is to —we ’re in a good place . Our policy ’s in a very\ngood place, and the right thing to do is , is await further clarity. And I —you know, there ’s—\nusually, things clarify , and that —the appropriate direction becomes clear. T hat’s what usually\n\nPage happens, right? Right now , it’s very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the\neconomy is doing fine. Our policy isn’ t—you know, it ’s not highly restrictive. It’s somewhat\nrestrictive. It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer. So we\nthink it ’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and\nsee and get more clarity about , about the direction of the economy.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine\nright now, because , reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,\nyou know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there. And I know that everybody’ s\nlooking at soft data right now. You mentioned it yourself —that the sentiment ’s sour. But the\nBeige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices\nrising in , in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the\nsideline. Doesn ’t that point to a slowdown?\nCHAIR POWELL. It may well. It just hasn ’t shown up yet. And , and, you know, we all\nlook at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel. And it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know, postponing economic decisions of various kinds. And , yes, if that continues and nothing,\nnothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show up in economic data. It wouldn’ t maybe show up overnight , but it would show up over weeks\nand months. And that may be what happens, but it hasn’ t happened yet. And also, there are\nthings that can happen that will —that will change that narrative. I mean, they haven’ t happened,\nbut it ’s possible to imagine things. But in the meantime, yes, we ’re watching it extremely\ncarefully , like everyone is, but don’ t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data\nyet. And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending. It ’s—you know, it ’s\n\nPage still—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment\non the part of people and businesses.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The\nFed’s been criticized recently by a former G overnor for what he calls “ mission creep ”—you take\non more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those\ntools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future. Is that a fair\ncritique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, say that critique again .\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Th at the Fed has been involved in mission creep— gets involved in\nusing too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far. Is that something that —the\ncritique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, okay. Sure.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. —and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.\nCHAIR POWELL. So —well, I mean, there are a couple —that’s not really beyond the\nconfines of our mandate. I —look, I would say this : We—you know, we did things —essentially ,\nwe were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it ’s very fair and\nvery welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “ Hey, you could have done this\nbetter and different. ” And one thing we hear a lot is , we could have explained the QE a little\nbetter. We did think we were explaining it in real time. I completely accept the , the thought that\nwe could have explained it better. There ’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE. I\ncan tell you that the reason we did was , we wer e—we were concerned that we didn’ t want a\ntightening of —a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy\n\nPage was still vulnerable. And so we did hold on for a long time to QE. And we, of course, tapered\nand everything. And then we immediately went into QT , and, you know, we ’ve—we ’re down a\ncouple of trillion. But I get the —that, you know, we , we certainly , with the benefit of hindsight ,\ncould have tapered earlier or faster. That’s absolutely right. But this is all very welcome. You\nknow, it ’s, it’s—you know, we knew , doing this in real time , that we weren ’t going to get it\nperfect. And those kind of —those kind of, you know, after -action kind of looks are essential.\nAnd we ’re doing the same thing in— you know, in our review, so—on some issues.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. There —the other part of that critique is that you ’ve taken on topics\nthat are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups\nare benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , okay, on climate, you ’ve heard me say over and over again that\nwe will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one. And\nI think —I think that ’s what we’ ve done. We’ ve done really very little on climate. You can say\nthat was— that little bit that we ’ve done was too much. B ut I wouldn’ t want to give any\nimpression that, that , you know, we take —that we ’ve taken climate in and it ’s something that\nwe’re spending a lot of time and energy on. We’ re not. We have very, very narrow things. We\ndid one thing, one guidance for the banks , and then we did one —a one -time stress analysis,\nclimate stress analysis, and that ’s it. And, you know, we dropped out of the N etwork for\nGreening the F inancial System. So we didn’ t do much on climate, but —and I do think, and I ’ve\nsaid this publicly several times, I think it’ s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate\nlike that, which is very narrow application to our work. And , you know, the risk is , if you—if\nyou go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent? You know, I think that ’s a very fair question. And I do think we ’ve done a whole lot less on\nclimate than some people seem to think we did. Anyway, that ’s what I think .\n\nPage MICHAEL MCKEE. Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment\nrates down for specific categories?\nCHAIR POWELL. We didn’ t do that. You know, we said—what we said was that we\nnever targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups. What we\nsaid was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal. And I think what we meant by that was , we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum -\nemployment goal. Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that, but I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way. Bu t that ’s not at all what we\nmeant. But —so that ’s just not a correct reading of our —but I can see how, you know, maybe\npeople found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell . Thanks for taking our questions today. I ’m Jo Ling\nKent with CBS News. You’ve said , “Wait and see” and “T he economy is doing fine ” today.\nBut the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports. Businesses big and small are telling\nus that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it. But the challenges are here. And there ’s no waiting and seeing. For Main Street, what is the breaking point? What would\nhave to happen to prompt a rate cut spec ifically?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, so we really don’ t see in the data yet big economic\neffects. We see—we see sentiment , their concerns that higher prices may be coming , or things\nlike that, but —so people , they’ re worried now about inflation . They’re worried about, you\nknow, a shock from the tariffs. But they really haven’ t—that shock hasn’ t hit yet. Okay, so, you\nknow, we ’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as\nwe assess what it is we should do. And remember, we ’re—there will be two effects. One of\nthem would be weakening economy —weakening economic activity , which translates into higher\n\nPage unemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation. Again, to say it again, the\ntiming, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain. So it ’s\nnot at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time. And we ’re—\nyou know —and by the way, our policy’ s in a good place , so we think we can wait and move\nwhen it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do. So\npeople are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn ’t gone up. J ob creation is fine .\nWages are in good shape. You know, people are not —layoffs are—people are not getting laid\noff at high levels. You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in any kind of impressive way. So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.\nJO LING KENT. Just a quick follow -up: President Trump now says he does not plan to\nremove you as Chair. When you heard that, what did you think?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t have anything more for you on that. I ’ve pretty much\ncovered that issue. T hank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Well, I\njust wanted to follow up. Earlier , it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you\nknow, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year. So does that —you\nknow, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were penciled in for this year. Is that now —that guidance from the last press conference, has that\nbeen overtaken by events at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’ t do a Summary of Economic Projections at\nevery meeting, as you know. We do it every other meeting. And so this was the meeting when\nwe didn’ t do it. And I —you know, we don’ t also kind of poll people, so I really —I really\nwouldn’ t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that. We will —in\n\nPage six weeks, we have the June meeting , and you’ ll have another SEP. I ’m not going to hazard a\nguess here today what —as to what it would be. Again, what I would say is that we think our\npolicy rate is in a good place. We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to\npotential development s. That ’s where we are, and that —depending on the way things play out,\nthat could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts. You know, it could include us holding where we\nare. We just are going to need to se e, you know, how things play out before we make those\ndecisions.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Great. And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you\naddress the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation, how are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other? So a rate cut\nto reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa . How does that —how do you\nhandle those challenges?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you just capture d the—this is the issue with the two goals\nbeing in tension. I t’s a very challenging question. Now, there can be a case in which one goal is\nvery far —one variable ’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other. And if so, you\nconcentrate on that one. And , frankly, that was the case—well , it wasn ’t a case where they were\nreally in tension . But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on\ninflation. The labor market was also super tight , so it wasn ’t really a tradeoff. You know, if —I\nthink you know what our —what our framework document says. It says we’ ll look at how far\neach goal —each variable is from its goal and also we’ ll factor in the time it would take to get\nthere. So , you know, that ’s going to be a —potentially , a very difficult judgment. But the data\ncould break in a way that it ’s not. You know, I just don’ t think we know that. The data could\neasily favor one or the other. And right now , there ’s no way to—no need to make a c hoice and\nno real basis for doing so.\n\nPage MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a with Politico. I wanted to ask, Congress is\ncurrently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts. And I know\nyou’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable. But given that we ’re\nalso talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just\nwondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’ t give Congress fiscal advice. I —they’ re going\nto do—we take what they do as a given , and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the\neconomy, so I wouldn’ t want to, you know, speculate on that. I mean, I think we do know that\nthe debt is on an unsustainable level —on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,\nbut an unsustainable path. A nd it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable\npath, and, you know, it ’s not up to us to give them advice.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic\nconditions into account as they look at this?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think they don ’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal\npolicy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Andrew Ackerman with the\nWashington Post. In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome further cooling in labor market conditions. The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent , which\nis what it is now. Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate. How has\nyour tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it was quite a different situation. What was happening last year is\nthat over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full\n\nPage percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month. And, you know,\neverywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market. At the same time,\npayroll job numbers were getting softer and softer. So there was a really obvious concern about downside risk to the labor market. And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we\nwanted to address that forthrightly. We wanted to show that we were there for the— I mean, we\nhad been there for inflation for a couple of years , and we wanted to show also that we ’re there\nfor the labor market. And it was important that we send that signal. Fortunately, since then, the labor market has really —and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level\nthat is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment. So that\nconcern has gotten a lot less. So, you know, you’ re at 4.2 percent unemployment. I think we\nwere in a very different situation. And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to higher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and\nwe’ve got to monitor both of those. We actually have a potential situation where there may be a\ntradeoff or tension between the two potentially. We don’ t have it yet, and we may not have it,\nbut that ’s what we [may] have, and that ’s why I think it ’s a very different , different situation.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of\na rise in the jobless rate you would —you could tolerate.\nCHAIR POWELL. I can ’t give you a —you know, a —I’m not going to try to give you a\nspecific number. I ’ll just say, we’ ve got —we have to now be looking at both variables and\nwhich of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than\nthe other, that would tell us what to do with polic y. If they ’re more or less th is, you know,\nequally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’ t have to make that assessment. You\nknow, the assessment is, you wait. So I ’m not going to try to be really specific about what we\nneed to see in terms of the number. But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant\n\nPage deterioration in the labor market, of course that’ s one of our two variables , and we would look to\nbe able to support that. You’d hope that it wasn’ t also coming at a time when inflation was\ngetting very bad. And , again, we ’re speculating here. We don ’t know this. We don’ t know any\nof these things. It’ s very hypothetical. We’ re just going to have to wait and see how the —how it\nplays out.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire .\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. In terms of getting some clarity, we ’ve\ngot some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U .S. and China. A lot of economists are\nask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how —what we hear from those talks. How\nmuch importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U .S.\neconomy going forward? And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it ’s\ndays, not weeks , that we have until we start to put the U .S. economy at ri sk of seeing a sort of\npandemic here , with shortage s and higher prices , if we don’ t kind of soothe relations between the\nU.S. and China. So it would be good to have your view on that, too.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , you know, these are not talks that we ’re in any way involved in,\nso I really can ’t comment directly on them. So —but what I will say is this : You know, we\nhad—coming out of the March meeting, we , we—the public generally had an assessment of\nwhere tariffs were going . And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than\nanticipated in the forecast s that I ’ve seen and in our forecast. So—and now we —and now we\nhave a different —we ’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’ re entering a new phase where\nthe A dministration is entering in to beginning talks with a number of our important trading\npartners. And that ’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not. And so I\nthink it ’s going to be very important how that shakes out. But I —you know, we simply have to\n\nPage wait and see how it works out. It certainly could change the picture, and we ’re mindful of not\ntrying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the —you know,\nwhen the facts are changing.\nCLAIRE JONES. And just on the fall in ship ping volumes from China over these\ntensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher\nprices in the coming weeks if this isn ’t resolved very quickly?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’ t want to get my —we ’re not —we shouldn’ t be\ninvolved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things. Yes, we ’re—of course ,\nwe follow all that data. We see the shipping data. We see all that. But , ultimately, this is for the\nAdministration to do. This is —you know, this is their mandate, not ours. And I know they’ re—\nas you can see, they ’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations. And that has\nthe potential to change the picture materially, so we ’ll just have to wait and see.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kosuke .\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. Kosuke Takami with Nikkei. Thank you for doing this. The\nvolume of imported goods increased significantly in the first quarter. Do you think the decision\ncould cause a delay in the impact of tariff on inflation, and does this mean that it will take a longer time to reduce uncertainty?\nCHAIR POWELL. The decision we made today? Which decision?\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. So the future decisions. So the volume of imports —\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. —imported goods has increased significantly. So the impact of the\nimported inflation may delay. So , what is the impact to your future decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so, I mean, I think we —I think we think that the —you know,\nthere was a big spike in imports —right ?—very big, historically large, really, and— to beat tariffs .\n\nPage And now that should actually reverse so that it ’s—you know, it ’s the difference between —it’s\nexports minus imports, so—and imports were huge , and so then it conveyed a very negative\ncontribution to U .S. GDP —annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know. So that could, in\nthe second quarter , be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—\nunusually positive. That ’s very likely as imports drop sharply. You could also have —you know,\nvery likely you’ ll have restatements of the —of the first quarter. It’ ll turn out that consumer\nspending was higher. It will turn out that inventories were higher. And so you’ ll see —you’ll see\nthose data revised up. It may actually go into the third quarter, too. And so I think it ’s going—\nthis whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U .S.\ndemand. I mentioned private domestic purchases, which doesn’ t have inventories ,\ngovernment , or—inventories , government. Anyway, it ’s a cleaner read on private demand . But\nthat, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by —you know, by strong demand for imports to\nbe tariffed. So that might overstate. It’s a really good rea ding, 3 percent PDFP in the first\nquarter. That might actually overstate. So it ’s not really going to—I don ’t think it’ s going to\naffect our decisions. I will just say, though, that it ’s a little confusing and it ’s probably less\nconfusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this. You know, it ’s\ncomplicated , and, you know, GDP is sending a signal . PDFP is sending a signal. It ’s a little bit\nconfusing. But I think we understand what ’s going, and it ’s not really going to change things\nfor us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thank you. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I guess, you\nknow, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic\nslowdown all being evident in the soft data. I ’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to\ntranslate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if\n\nPage the hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff -related effects. Are you worried that\nthe soft data might be some sort of false warning?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I mean, it ’s—look, the —look at the state of the economies. The\nlabor market is solid . Inflation is low. We can afford to be patient as things unfold. There ’s no\nreal cost to our waiting at this point. Also, the sense of it —the sense of it is, we’re not sure what\nthe right thing will be. You know, there should be some increase in inflation. T here should be\nsome increase in unemployment. Those call for different responses. And so until we know —\npotentially call for different respon ses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the\nability to wait and see. And it seems to be a pretty clear decision. Everyone on the C ommittee\nsupported waiting. And so that ’s why we ’re waiting.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Just a very quick follow -up: T here was this sort of vibe\nsession, if you will, where the sentiment s expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard\neconomic data. Are you —how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs\nin the softer survey data?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between\nsentiment data and consumer spending has been weak. It’ s not been a strong link at all. On the\nother hand, we haven’ t had a move of this, you know, speed and size. So it wouldn’ t be the case\nthat we ’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it. But it’ s another reason to wait and\nsee. You ’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were\nsaying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money. So that can happen,\nand that may happen to some degree here. We just don’ t know. This is an outsized change in\nsentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we ’re sure one way or\nthe other. We’re not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\n\nPage MATT EGAN. Thanks, Chair Powell . Matt Egan with CNN. So you mentioned earlier\nthat you ’re monitoring the shipping data. And we have seen in the shipping data that imports\nfrom China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged. And that has raised concerns about\npotential shortages. What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation\nexpectations don’ t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, we don’ t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at\ndealing with supply chain problems. We don’ t have that at all. That ’s a—that’s a job for the\nAdministration and for the private sector more than anything. You know, what we can do with\nour interest rate tool is , we can support —be more or less supportive of demand. And that ’s—\nthat’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems. But , you know, we don’ t\nsee—we don’t see the inflation yet. We’ re, of course , reading the same stories and watching the\nsame data as everybody else. And , you know, right now , we see inflation, you know, kind of\nmoving sideways at a fairly low level.\nMATT EGAN. If I c ould follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will\nlikely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year. But your position on the B oard runs through January 2028, I believe. Would you consider remaining on the Fed\nBoard even if you’ re no longer Chair?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’ t have anything for you on that. My whole focus is on —\nand my colleagues ’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we ’re in right\nnow, trying to make the right decisions. You know, we want to make the best decisions for the\npeople that we serve. That ’s what we think about day and night. And this is a challenging\nsituation, and that’s, that ’s 100 percent of our focus right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jennifer for the last question.\n\nPage JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you so much, Chair Powell . Jennifer Schonberger\nwith Yahoo Finance. Public records of your schedule so far this year show no meetings with\nPresident Trump. Past Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have all met with Fed C hairs. And\nyou met with Trump during his first term. Why haven’ t you asked for a meeting yet with the\nPresident?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve never asked for a meeting with any President , and I never will.\nIt’s not —I wouldn’ t do that. There ’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting. It ’s always\nbeen the other way.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. So would you want to meet with him if given the\nopportunity —\nCHAIR POWELL. I never —\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —to get more information?\nCHAIR POWELL. I never —it’s never an initiative that I take. It’s always an\ninitiative —I—you know, I don’ t think it’ s up to a Fed C hair to seek a meeting with the\nPresident, although maybe some have done so. I ’ve never done so, and I can’ t imagine myself\ndoing that. It ’s—I think it’ s always —comes the other way : A President wants to meet with you.\nBut that hasn’ t happened.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And if I could just ask one question on monetary policy,\nwhen it is time to cut rates, how will you determine how far down rates will have to come to try to keep a balance on the inflation mandate as employment weakens?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think once you have a direction—a clear direction, you\ncan make a —we can make a judgment about how fast to move and that kind of thing. So it ’s—\nreally , the harder question is the timing, I think, and when will that become clear? And ,\nfortunately, as I mentioned, we have our policy in a good place, the economy’ s in a good place,\n\nPage and it ’s really appropriate, we think, for us to be patient and wait for things to unfold as we get\nmore clarity about what we should do.\nThanks very much."
