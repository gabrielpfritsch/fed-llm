  "text": "June 12 , 2024\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the\npast two years. The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a p eak of 7 percent to\n2.7 percent but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent\ngoal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. I ’ll have more to say\nabout monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nAlthough GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic purchases —which excludes inventory\ninvestment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last ye ar’s robust pace but remains\nsolid. And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’ s pace, with a median\nprojection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.\n\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.\nPayroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong\nbut a bit below that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low\nat 4 percent. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of imm igration. Nominal wage growth has eased over\nthe past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators\nsuggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic —relatively tight but not overheated. FOMC participants expect la bor market\nstrength to continue. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal\nof 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding\nthe volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 perce nt. The c onsumer price\nindex—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE , PCE price index—\nrose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent. The\ninflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat. Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as\nit erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials\n\nlike food, housing, and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual\nmandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As\nlabor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals ha ve moved toward better balance. The economic\noutlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the\nfederal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that g reater confidence. The most\nrecent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective. We will need to see more good\ndata to bolster our confidence t hat inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress that we ’ve seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or\ntoo little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median par ticipant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026. But these projections are\n\nnot a Committee plan or any kind of a decision. As the economy evolves, assessments of the\nappropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment\nand price -stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we ’re prepared to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor\nmarket were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,\nwe’re prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that\nwe face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We ’ll continue to make our decisions\nmeeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stabi lity is essential to\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering\non these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities,\nfamilies, and businesses across the country. Eve rything we do is in service to our public\nmission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and\nprice -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Just wondering\nif you could walk me through the Committee ’s average inflation forecast —core PCE is now\nforecast to be 2.8 percent by the year -end. It ’s already 2.75, and after today’ s number, there\nwere several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month. Does that tell\n\nyou that the average official expects no further progress in inflation a nd, in fact, that it ’s going to\nget worse? And if you have this wrong, doesn’ t it mean that you sort of —you, you could have\nwrong the outlook for rates there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So what ’s going on there is that we had very low readings in\nthe second half of last year —June through December, really. And we ’re now lapping those. So\nas you go through the 12 -month window, a very low reading drops out , and a new reading comes\nin. The new reading gets added to the 12- month window. So it’s just a, a slight element of\nconservativism that we ’re, we’re assuming a certain level of —of, you know, incoming monthly\nPCE and core PCE numbers. We ’re assuming, you know, good, but not great , numbers. And if\nyou put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12- month —in the\n12-month, you know, reading. Now, do we have high confidence that that ’s right? No. It’ s just\nthe kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today ’s\nreading, then, of course, that wouldn ’t be the case. So it ’s just a forecasting device. I think, I\nthink—let me say that we welcome today ’s reading and then hope for more like that.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But if it comes in —just to follow up—if it comes in the way you\nforecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah —no. I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we\ndon’t think it’ ll be appropriate to , to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more\nconfidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a —on a sustainable basis. And\nthat’s the—that’s the test we ’ve applied. I don’ t know that —I think if we —I don’t know that\nthis rules that in or out. I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast —a fairly conservative forecast month\nby month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12- months rates by the end of the year.\n\nIf we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or , or\nremain the same. If you ’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that ’s, that’s a really good place to\nbe.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, if I look at\nthe, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut —two cuts\nthis year —fairly evenly split between the two. And so I wonder if you could explain a little\nmore the nuances or the differences there. Would two or three more inflation readings like the\none that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?\nCHAIR POWELL. So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned —as you know, I talk\nto—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle , and we talk about their\nSummary of E conomic P rojections and, and the dot plot —and, you know, the ir dot plot and\neverything. And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a\nrange of plausible outcomes. And in many cases, they ’re—they’re thinking, “ I don’ t really ”—\nyou know, “ I can ’t really distinguish between two of these. They ’re so close for me. ” These are\nvery close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one —so they do. And as, I think ,\nyou’ve, you’ve —as you’ ve said, there ’s 15 of the 19 are , are kind of clustered around one or\ntwo. So I think I would look at , at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I ’d look at —so I\nthink that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.\nBut what everyone agrees on is , it’s going to be data dependent. No one —no one brings\nto this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular\nrate path. It’ s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their\nown reaction function. But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I\n\ndon’t hold it with high confidence. And I think if you’ re looking for —and , and don’ t really\nthink that they ’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “ this is what I think is the right\nthing.” It’s just what they think at a given moment in time , subject to data.\nIn terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’ t, you know —we don’ t—we don’t try\nto—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there. I think in terms of what\nwe need to see, I mentioned it earlier —we, we want to —we want to gain further confidence.\nCertainly, more good inflation readings will help with that. I ’m not going to be specific about\nhow many because, you know, really, it ’s going to be not just the inflation rating —readings —it’s\ngoing to be the totality of the data : what ’s happening in the labor market, what ’s happening with\nthe balance of risks, what ’s happening with the forecast, what ’s happening with growth. You\nlook at all of that, and you ask, “A re we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of\nconfi dence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent , or, alternatively, do we see\nreally unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response ?”—which\nis—which is another thing that could, could happen. But, again, we don’ t see that. And I —we\ndo see today ’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.\nBut we , we don’ t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant —you know, that\nwould warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And if I could quickly follow up—did , did you or any of your\ncolleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation\nnumbers today?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen. It just is, you\nknow —data came— I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago. So when\nthat happens —when there ’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—\n\nwhat we do is , we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update. We tell\nthem how to do that. And , and some people do; some people don’ t. Most , most people don’ t.\nBut I ’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that. So that, you\nknow —what ’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,\nyou know, reflect it in one day. I think we ’ll, you know —you will see PPI tomorrow . We’ll\nknow more about the PCE [inflation] readi ng as the month goes on. But the initial CPI reading\nand its, you know, kind of first -level translation to , to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.\nWe were briefed about it , and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.\nAnd, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’ t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Hi, Chair Powell. Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg. As you\nnoted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic. I\nwondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that . So do you think that there\nstill needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent ,\nor is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that\nmany of those imbalances have eased?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind\nof overheated two years ago. And we ’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance\nbetween supply and demand. So, what have we seen? We ’ve seen labor force supply come up\nquite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That ’s ongoing, mostly\nnow through the im migration channel. But still, we ’ve had some increases in prime -age labor\nforce. In terms of on the demand side, you know, we ’ve seen —well, we’ve seen quits moving\ndown. W e’ve seen job openings moving down. W e’ve seen wage increases moving from very,\n\nvery high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels. We have seen\nunemployment creep up now sixth- tenths over the course of , of a year or so very, very gradually.\nSo you put all that together —what you have is still -low unemployment, still 4 percent\nunemployment —historically low. But it ’s moved up a little bit —it’s softened a bit —and, and,\nyou know, that ’s an important statistic. But , but more than that, you’ ve got strong job creation.\nYou, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there ’s an argument\nthat they may be a bit over stated but still they ’re, they’re still—they’re strong. So that ’s what we\nsee. We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole —but the labor\nmarket very carefully —and that ’s what we see. We see gradual cooling —gradual moving\ntoward better balance. We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,\nbut we really don’ t see that.\nJONNELLE MARTE. As a quick follow- up—t he surveys that make up the jobs report\nare, are showing different tales. There ’s been some divergence, especially , we saw , in the last\nreport that we got on Friday. So how do you interpret that , and, and how does it change your\nview on the labor market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So sometimes it’s —you can ’t reconcile the differences. Y ou just\nhave to, have to —have to look at it and, and try to understand. And that ’s why it always makes\nsense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one\nreport. But you’ re right to point to the last report, where it was your —job losses in the\nhousehold survey—job gains , big job gains in the establishment survey. So, I mean, we ’re left\nwith ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless, the\noverall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market. Job openings, while they ’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of\n\nunemployed people. The jobs –workers gap is still a significantly positive number —greater than\nit was before the pandemic. So , overall, we ’re looking at what i s still a very strong labor market\nbut not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil .\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin , with Axios. Back on the rates path :\nThe SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March —that ’s a period in\nwhich the economic data flow hasn’ t been that dramatic a shift. How, how —can you provide\nsome color on what change d in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to , to\nsee a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the\ninflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year. And , and, as I mentioned\nearlier , in the, you know —what , what did we take away from this? We had really , really good\ninflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.\nAnd what we took away from that was that it ’s probably going to take longer to get the\nconfidence that we need to begin to loosen policy . So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might\ntake place in —might ’ve taken place this year —take place next year, you know? We, we—t here\nare—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there ’s one more next year. So, so you\nreally —if you look at year -end 2025 and ’ 26, you’ re, you’re almost exactly where you would\nhave been, just it —just it’ s moved later because of that progress. Now, you get another —you\nget data —different data today. So we ’ll have to see where the data light the way . You know,\nwe’re, we’re —the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,\nand today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected. And we ’ll just\n\nhave to see what , what —what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the\noutlook and the balance of risks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. In the S ummary of E conomic P rojections, the long- run interest rate forecast moved\nup a bit. I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as\nrestrictive as we ’ve previously expected. You know, how should we interpret what that means\nabout how the Committee views its current policy setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So two things about that —one , one is this —you’ re right, it did move\nup. B ut, but I want to remember to point out that the long -run neutral rate of interest is , is a\nlong- run concept. It , it really is a theoretical concept —can ’t be directly observed. And what it is\nis the , the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium— maximum employment and\nprice stability —potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks. So it’s—\nit’s a little bit —it’s not something we observe today. Today we ’ve got a very specific economy\nwith all kinds of shocks we ’re still getting over from the pandemic. So it’s—I, I don ’t think that\nthe, the concept of r -star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do. B ut,\nhonestly, it doesn’ t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is\nin the near term.\nBut I, I —back to your original question , people have been gradually writing it up because\nI just think people are coming to the view that rates are n’t—are less likely to go down to their ,\ntheir pre-pandemic levels, which were , you know, very low by recent history measures. Now,\nwe, we can’t really know that. That ’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,\nbut, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer -run, slow -moving\n\nforces. And, you know, there ’s a really good question about whether , whether those really have\nchanged or whether , instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a , a series of persistent but,\nultimately, temporary shocks. That ’s been the debate, and we can ’t know. But in the meantime,\nwe’re making policy with the economy that we have —with the distortions that we have. And I, I\nalso—to your other point, I , I think it is —it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of\n“How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone ’s asking, and we ’re asking it , too.\nAnd, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive. The question of whether it ’s\nsufficiently restrictive is going to be one we , we know over time. But I think for the reasons I ’ve\ntalked about at the last press conference and , and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear\nthat policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell . Howard Schneider , with Reuters. Just\nto—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of\ntipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to\nmarket on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren ’t quite there yet?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion. I , I think this is about,\nyou know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “H ow much progress are we making on\ninflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing? I s the labor market still strong? ” That ’s\nwhat we ’re thinking about . You know, you can—you can translate it into the —into the language\nyou’re talking about , but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,\nand an other goal, which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we ’ve\ngot a good, strong labor market still. We think we ’ve been making progress toward the price -\n\nstability goal. And then for a while , there was a pause. A nd we look at today’ s thing, and we\nthink, “W ell, that ’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that. ” And, you know, in the\nmeantime, we’ re asking , “Is our policy stance about right? ” And I think we think, “Y es, it ’s\nabout right.” We’ re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think— we think we ’re getting\nthe things that we would want to get , broadly speaking. And that ’s why we ’ve been at this\npolicy r ate now for almost a year.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, so just to follow up on that —I think one , one curious\nthing here is , you’ ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the\nmajor things for all of this year. You ’ve got growth that stays above long- run potential\nthroughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long- run estimate —\nright ?—of 4.2. So this isn’ t a story of slack improving inflation. So where ’s the improvement in\ninflation coming from that it’ s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, it’s been coming —where’s it been coming from —\nlet’s start with that. You know, clearly a lot of what —some of what we’ ve been getting is just\nthe reversal of the —the unwinding of the pandemic -related distortions to both supply and\ndemand. And that is, you know —that is complemented by and amplified —supported by\nrestrictive monetary policy. So those two things have been working together. We ’ve also had a\nvery positive supply shock on the labor side. And, and, also, you get —you get a positive supply\nshock when the —when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal. So you’ ve had, you\nknow, above -trend potential growth and , and high growth. And yet you’ ve had the benefit of , of\ninflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest\nof this year brinks —brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. I mean,\nultimately, the question is , ultimately, are you down to demand? And , and we don’ t know that,\n\nthough. I mean, look at today’ s report . You know , if we see more like that —you know, we\ndon’t —we can ’t know what the future holds. But in the meantime, we ’ve made pretty good\nprogress on inflation with our current stance.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The base\ncase of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but\nyour growth forecast doesn’ t see any slowdown in the rest of the year , nor does the\nunemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market. And your inflation forecasts basically average out to no change. So if , at the end of the year , there is no change\nfrom conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates? Wh at, what would be the point\nfor a rate cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we think —we think policy is restrictive. And we think,\nultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real\nweakening in the economy. So that ’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise\nrates this far, we’ ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point. Not to eliminate the\npossibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case , so—no one on the\nCommittee does. But so that ’s, that’s —you know, that ’s how we think about it. And that ’s what\nwe’ve been getting. That ’s what we ’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at\na—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market. Now, ultimately, we think rates will have\nto come down to continue to support that. But, so far, they haven’ t had to. And, you know,\nthat’s why we ’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness. We don’ t really see that. We kind\nof see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand —gradual rebalancing in the\n\nlabor market while we ’re continuing to make progress on inflation. So we ’re getting —we’re\ngetting good results here.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. But , to follow up : Is there any kind of concern for the housing\nindustry or financial stability —banks —in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.\nAnd you can see that ’s a place where rates are really having , having a significant effect. I mean,\nultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we\ncan bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize. There will still be a national housing shortage , as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one, but the\ndistortions that we see now with lock -ins and things like that —you know, low mortgages —in\nterms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized. Lending—y ou know, we ’ve seen good performance by the banks. We had the turmoil earlier\nlast year , but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their li quidity, bringing up\ntheir capital, and having a risk— risk-management plans in place. So the banking system, you\nknow, seems to be —seems to be in good shape.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thanks . Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I was\nwondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy. You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance, and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. You ’re seeing, you know, anecdotal\nstories of , the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald ’s\nannouncing a $5 meal deal. So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but\n\nit doesn ’t seem like there ’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy —and wonder if you\ncould tell us more about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think it ’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have\ncome down. But we still have—we ’re still getting high inflation readings. So, you know —and I\nthink you can see it in, in various places in —you know, in some parts of , of nonhousing services.\nYou see elevated inflation still—and that ’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.\nGoods prices have kind of fluctuated. There ’s been a surprising increase in , in import prices on\ngoods, which is kind of hard to understand. And, you know, may , may —we’ve taken some\nsignal from that, but, you know —and, and, of course, housing services. You ’re seeing —you’re\ncontinuing to see high readings there to some extent. That ’s, that’s, you know, catch- up inflation\nfrom earlier pressures. But, I mean, overall, you ’re right. Inflationary pressures have come\ndown. As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance. Wages are still running,\nyou know, I would say, above a , a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and\ntrend productivity. You ’re still seeing wage increases moving above that. We, we haven ’t\nthought of wages as being the principal , you know, cause of inflation. But at the same time,\ngetting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which\nis somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post . Thanks\nfor taking our questions. There ’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected\nthis year. But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do\nto the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end\nof the year or even two?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I think if, you know —if you look back in 5 or 10 years and , and try\nto pull out the significance to the U .S. economy of one 25 bas is point rate cut, you’ d, you’d have\nquite a job on your hands. So that’s not how we look at it —you know , really, the whole rate\npath matters. And I , I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen\npolicy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions. And the\nmarket will price in what it prices in. I don’t —I have no way of saying— we’re, we ’re not at that\nstage, so I don’ t know what we ’ll be thinking about at that time. But it ’s a consequential\ndecision for the economy. And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right. And ,\nfortunately, we have a strong economy, and we , we have the ability to, you know, approach this\nquestion carefully. And we will approach it carefully while we ’re very much keeping an eye on,\nyou know, downside economic risks , should they —should they emerge.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And you ’ve been talking about this clear sense that it ’s just going to\ntake longer to have the confidence that ’s needed for rate cuts. Is there something about what\nhappened in the first couple of months of the year that you ’re seeing differently now with more\ntime or hindsight? Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting\nthat is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the\nparts of inflation that we —that we don ’t like and just make it go away. So —but we had a\nquarter where inflation was running higher , and, yes, I could stand here and say, “I t’s stuff we\nshouldn’ t have taken signal from.” But it is what it is . You know, you, you have to —you know,\nlow inflation is low inflation . High—so i f you have a quarter where it ’s higher —we tried not to\ntake signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the\nsignal we ’re taking is that, you know, we think it ’s going to take longer to get confidence that\n\ninflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.” That ’s, that’s what we said. I think that was\nthe right thing to do. I still think that’ s the right thing to do. Now we have today ’s inflation\nreading, which is very different —very much more positive. We’re going to have to see what the\ntrend is —what ’s, what’s going to be the data going forward. We’ re looking for something that\ngives us confidence that inflation is , is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. And readings like\ntoday’ s, you know —that ’s a step in the right direction. But, you know, one reading is —isn’t— it\njust—it’s only one reading. You don’ t want to —you don’t want to be too motivated by any\nsingle data point.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I ’m Jo Ling\nKent , with CBS News. What ’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging\neconomic data but don ’t feel good about this economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know —I, I don’ t think anyone knows —has a definitive answer\nwhy people are , are not as happy about the economy as they might be. And we don’ t tell people\nhow they should think or feel about the economy. That ’s not our job. We —you know, people\nexperience what they experience. All I can tell you is what the —what the data show, which is ,\nwe’ve got an economy that ’s growing at a solid pace. W e’ve got a very strong labor market with\nunemployment at 4 percent. It ’s been a long time sinc e we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of\ntime with unemployment at or below 4 percent— very long time. We had a period of high\ninflation. We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we ’re doing everything we can\nto—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.\nWe’re confident that we ’ll get there. And in the meantime, you know, it ’s going to be painful\nfor, for people , but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high\n\ninflation. It is people who—lower -income people —people who are at the margins of the\neconomy who, who have the worst experience— who experience the most pain from inflation.\nSo, you know, it ’s for those people —for all Americans , but particularly for those people —that\nwe’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.\nJO LING KENT. As just a quick follow -up here —you’ ve indicated one interest rate cut\nsometime this year. And I know you don’ t have a crystal ball up there , but a lot of people are\nwatching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive. For everybody who’ s\nout there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, I , I don’ t have a precise date for you. But what we\nsaid is that we , we want to make sure that we ’re confident that inflation is actually moving back\ndown to 2 percent. And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy. So having that kind\nof confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,\nto all Americans, for a long period of time. We had that period for a very long time . We very\nmuch want to get back to a place where people can , can not think about inflation—i t’s just not a\nconcern in the everyday economic decisions that they make. We were ther e for a long time , and\nour goal is to get back to that place. And we ’ve made good progress , and we ’re just —we ’re in\nthe phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. I’m just drawing on the change in the\nstatement on there being “modest further progress ” on inflation. You know, halfway, you know,\nthrough the year and after today ’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee\nmembers found that has been particularly encouraging to you? And just in terms of the\n\nconservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, encouraging has been that growth— you know, the growth,\nclearly , that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see\nstill-strong growth —solid growth this year. That ’s been very encouraging. If you go back a\nyear, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession —many forecasters had that. And that ’s not what happened. Instead, we —the U.S. is ,\nanyway, and it ’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the\nworld. So that ’s been encouraging. I would say that the , the—today’ s inflation report is\nencouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.\nYou asked about —your second question was really about shelter inflation. So I think if\nyou go back a couple of years —we, we know that there were renters , and then there are, you\nknow, people who own their houses . And we have OER, which is owners ’ equivalent rent. And\nso when market -based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the —of the—when the\neconomy reopened, they really went up sharply. Those play into rollover rents much more\nslowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants. And , and so what we —so we, we ’ve\nfound now that there are big lags. So there ’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in ,\nin market rents. It has to get worked off , and that may take, you know, several years.\nNonetheless, as long as market rents remain —are going at —up at relatively low levels —and\nthey still are —you know, this , this is just going to happen. It just is going to happen more slowly\nthan we thought.\nYou know, we , we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to , to owned\nhomes. And that ’s—you know, many countries around the world do that. Some do it differently\n\nthan us. It ’s something that the —you know, that the , the price experts have regularly looked at.\nIt is not something that we ’re the only country that does, and it ’s not something we ’re looking at\nchanging or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon. But it—it’ s true. It ’s one of the\nvery hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services\nthat someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they ’re actually living in it.\nAnd some countries —you should just ignore that. But that ’s not our —that’s not how we do\ninflation here. We, we do it the way we do it , and we ’ve been very transparent about it. And,\nyou know, it ’s true that we ’re—we’re seeing delays in , in realizing what —what ’s happening\neconomically . But we understand that —you know, we understand that very well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business. Thank you for taking\nthe question, Chair Powell. So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer. The last jobs report\nshow ed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs. That ’s up 8.2 percent.\nAnd since January of 2021, we ’ve seen prices rise 19 percent. So people are using their credit\ncards to pay for their lifestyle. What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy\ncould maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more .\nYou know , what we ’re seeing is, basically , spending was going up faster than disposable income\nduring big parts of next year , so—last year, rather —and so what that—you’d expect to see is\npeople spending more on their credit cards . That —that has been happening. Credit card\nbalances have been going up. C redit card defaults have been going up. T hey’re not at high\nlevels. Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up. T hey couldn’ t spend money.\nThey couldn ’t go out to spend money ; they could spend money from home . But households\n\nwere in very, very strong —historically strong —financial shape. They ’ve now worked off a lot\nof that. So we’re, we’re watching that carefully. And, you know, what do we see? That ’s what\nwe see. We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you ’ve still got a household\nsector that ’s in—that’s in pretty good shape . You know —but , nonetheless, it ’s not in the kind of\nshape it was in a year or two ago. And we ’re, you know —we ’re carefully watching that.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So how close then are we to that point where the consumer\ncan’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can ’t hire like they ’re hiring?\nCHAIR POWELL. So consumer spending is still growing. It ’s not growing at the pace it\nwas growing at a year or so ago, but , but it’s still —it’ s still growing solidly. And, by the way,\nother parts of the economy are picking up. Spending on equipment and intangibles is —has\npicked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—\nyou know, tech plants. So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know —\nsomething around 2 percent —which is —which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for\nthe U.S. economy. But , no, you’ re, you’re right, though. We, we do see the same thing other\npeople see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower -income\npeople. And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is , is to foster a very strong jobs economy,\nwhich we think we have done —ultimately to get inflation under control , because those people\nexperience inflation, you know, very directly —very painfully. And, and, you know, once , once\nwe get inflation under control, rates can come down—which , which will also improve things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. You ’ve mentioned that\nunexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner. And I was just\nwondering —can you talk a little bit about what that would look like? Is it more of, like , a\n\nquicker pace of people losing jobs? Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to\nstart to go above 4.2 or something like that? How are you thinking about what you’ re looking\nfor to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know —you know, when I say “ unexpectedly,” the first thing is\nmore than , kind of , is in our forecast or in common forecasts —so, something more than that .\nBut we ’ll be looking at everything. Y ou know , we’ll— the, the labor market, you know, has the\nability —has , has the tendency sometimes to , to weaken quickly. So waiting for that to happen is ,\nis not what we ’re doing. You know, we ’re watching very carefully ; we’re looking at the balance\nof risks. I always point out the balance of risks , so—and, and also the fact that we look at , at all\nof it— the whole situation. So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy\ncould have several reasons associated with it at a given time. But I, you know, I would just —\nyou know, we monitor all the —all the labor market data. A nd if we saw troubling—weakening\nmore than —more than expected, then that would be something we ’d consider responding to. B ut\nwe’d look at the —we look at the broader context of what ’s going on, too.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So something like negative payroll numbers would be —\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not going to —yeah, I mean, I , I can think of things that would—\nmany things would make it on that list, but I don ’t think I ’ll, I’ll utter them here.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with t he\nEconomist. May I ask —you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier\nthis year , that it wasn ’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more\ncautious in the rate outlook. Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be\nquite good for PC E [inflation ], as it was for CPI —does that imply that kind of two more good\n\nmonths would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently\nproject?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I , I don’ t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,\nin my thinking. I , I get that, you know —as many good ones as we had bad ones —but it ’s not\nlike that. It’s the whole. It’s going to be the totality of the data —[including] l abor market data ,\nthe growth data . In terms of inflation, you know, you’ d, you’d want to see real progress that\nbuilds your confidence that we’re —that we are on a path down to 2 percent. And I , I don’ t want\nto try to give you specific numbers of things , because that points to dates , and I , I just don’ t\nthink—we ’re not at a point of being able to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kosuke. KOSUKE TAKAMI. Thank you for doing this. I, I am Kosuke Takami , with Nikkei. I\nwould like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.\nAnd I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in —Japan and some\nemerging market s are suffering from the strong d ollar. So I want to know if it is having a\npositive impact on U.S. economy in total? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’ t—actually , it’s our —it’s our finance ministry , the\nTreasury Department , that has a responsibility for thinking about and , and, if it sees fit, doing\nthings about the level of the dollar. So for us, it ’s just another financial variable. And you’ re\nright —the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last\nyear or so because the U.S. economy is very strong. We don’ t think of it as benefiting or hurting\nthe U.S. We don’ t—again, we don’ t manage the level of the dollar. That ’s, that’s not our —\nthat’s not our job. It ’s not . You know —and for , for our economy, what , you know, we ’re trying\n\nto foster is maximum employment and price stability. And we feel like we’ ve made good\nprogress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger , with\nYahoo Finance. You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent. You ’re\nforecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE . We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,\non core PCE. Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to\n2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be. You also indicated the\njob market has mostly normalized. So why not cut rates this summer j ust once —you’ re well\nabove neutral —to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest\nfor confidence for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know —so we are—we ’re well aware of the two -sided risks\nhere, let me just say. We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of\neconomic activity, of employment, of the expansion. We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we ’ve done and have to then start over,\nand it c ould be very disruptive. So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and , and\njust basically trying to manage them. And what we sa id is that we’ll —that we’re —we don’ t\nthink it ’ll be appropriate to , to begin to loosen policy until we ’re more confident that inflation is\nmoving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis. That’s —that’s kind of been our test.\nOr there ’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market\nconditions. So I think that’ s, that’s the right way for us to think about it. That’s our —that’s our\ndual mandate there. And, you know, we , we have a strong economy. W e’ve got growth—all\nforecasts are very commonly around 2 percent. That ’s a— that’s a strong growth rate for our\n\neconomy. The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate. Unemployment is still\nlow. So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that ’s, that’s what\nwe’re doing.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And just to follow, Chair Powell —do you need to be\nahead of a weakening in the labor market? Otherwise, is it too late , given that the labor market is\na lagging indicator —right ?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’ s the risk. And that ’s,\nthat’s not what we’re —that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.\nWe’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework ,\nand we think we ’re doing that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Evan Ryser with Market News International.\nYou have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.\nAt this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that? Who will lead it? Will\nyou be —will it be you or a member —a C ommittee group of your —of your peers? What will be\nthe parameters? Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going\nforward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—what, what we ’ve been thinking is that we would announce\nand commence the review later or late in the year. In the meantime, as that time approaches, we\nwill be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it. Within scope would certainly be communications generally. I —I’m not going to say that we ’ll look at this or that\nparticular thing. And all the other details, you know —we ’re just —we don’ t want to get\n\nprematurely into a conversation until it’ s really time to have it. And so, you know, I ’m going to\nleave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Nancy, for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer , with\nMarketplace. Just one more question on housing —can you still cut rates with shelter prices high ,\nor will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t—there isn ’t any one thing— one variable , like housing\nprices moderating , that would really decide or decide against what we’ re doing. We’ ve got an\noverall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a\nsustainable basis. That ’s our overall test. Or , alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the\nlabor market. So those are—those are two different tests. I would say, you know, we ’re not —\nwe’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “ That’s the one.” We don’ t\ntarget housing prices, for example. And we don’t target wages. We, we target aggregate prices\nand overall employment, so—\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow\ndown the pace of rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you’ d look at the over —we ’d be looking at the aggregate\nnumbers and, and asking ourselves, “What ’s going on here with inflation in the —at the\naggregate level? ” And, you know —and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing\ninflation would , would matter . Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter ,\ntoo, but I wouldn’ t single out housing as having a , a special role there.\nThank you very much."
