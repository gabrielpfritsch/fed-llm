  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made considerable progress toward our dual -mandate objectives. Inflation has\neased substantially over the past year , while the labor market has remained strong . And that’s\nvery good news. But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achi eve a sustainably strong labor market\nthat benefits all.\nToday , the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary\npolicy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past\nyear. However, in recent months , inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our\n2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. I’ ll have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nAlthough GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to\n1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic f inal purchases—which excludes inventory\ninvestment, government spending and net exports , and usually sends a clearer signal on\nunderlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023. Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarte rs, even as high interest rates\n\nhave weighed on housing and equipment investment. Improving supply conditions have\nsupported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come\ninto better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor\ndemand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of\n2 percent. T otal PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the\nvolatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The inflation data\nreceived so far this year have been higher than expected. Although s ome measures of short -term\ninflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nThe Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities\n\nholdings, though at a slower pace. Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and\ninflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range\nfor the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate. We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress we ’ve seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too\nlittle could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess incoming data,\nthe evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We will continue to\nmake decisions meeting by meeting.\nTurning to our balance sheet : The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the\npace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously. Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per\nmonth to $25 billion per month as of June 1. Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we ’re leaving the cap on agency securities\n\nunchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury\nsecurities. With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion\nper month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff wi ll help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that\nmoney markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to\nset the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We , at the\nFed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. A question and\nfollow -up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still —are you confident that it ’s\nsufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think the evidence shows , you know, pretty clearly that\npolicy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that. You can start with the labor market . So demand is still strong—the demand side of the\nlabor market , in particular—but it ’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,\n\nand you see that in job openings . You saw it —more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report ,\nas you’ ll know. It’ s still higher than pre -pandemic . But it has been coming down both in the\nIndeed r eport and the JOLTS report . That’s, that’s demand cooling. The same is true of quits\nand hiring rates, which have essentially normalized. I also look at the —we look at surveys of\nworkers and —pardon me —surveys of workers and businesses , and [they] ask workers , “Are jobs\nplentiful? ” and ask businesses, “ Are workers plentiful? Is it easy to find workers ?” And you’ ve\nseen that the answers to those have come back down to pre -pandemic levels. You also see in\ninterest -sensitive spending, like housing and investment —you also see that higher interest rates\nare weighing on those activities. So I do think it ’s clear that , that policy is restrictive.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say that we believe it is restrictive , and we believe [that]\nover time it will be sufficiently restrictive. That will be a question that, that the data will have to\nanswer.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So as a follow -up, if inflation continues running roughly\nsideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and\nexpectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for —\nCHAIR POWELL. Expectations are not anchored?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Are anchored.\nCHAIR POWELL. Are anchored.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Stable, roughly . Would you disrupt that for the last half point\non PCE?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’ t want to get into complicated hypotheticals . But I\nwould say that , you know, we ’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy\nfor as long as is appropriate . And w e’ll do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions , Chair Powell. I wonder —you\nknow, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to\nincrease further, although it ’s not her baseline outlook. I wonder if you see that as a risk as well,\nand, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it ’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\nI’d say it ’s unlikely. You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is —\nwhich is how long to keep policy restrictive. You ask , what would it take ? You know, I think\nwe’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time. That’s not —that’s not what we think we ’re\nseeing, as I —as I mentioned, but that’s —something like that is what it would take. We’d look at\nthe totality of the data in answer to that question . That would include inflation, inflation\nexpectations, and all the other data too.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Would that be —would that be a reacceleration in inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think , again, the test —what I ’m saying is , if we were to come\nto that conclusion that policy weren’ t tight enough to achieve that , so it would be the totality of\nall the things we ’d be looking at. It could be expectations . It could be a combination of things .\nBut, if we —if we reach that conclusion—and we don’ t see evidence supporting that\nconclusion —that ’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You\ndidn’ t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn ’t mention the idea that it\nmight be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences. So\nhas the F ed sort of dropped its easing bias? Where are you standing on that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on —let me address cuts. So, obviously , our decisions that we\nmake on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving, and the balance of risks, as always. And we ’ll look at the totality of the data. So I think, and we\nthink, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take. And\nwe’ve said that we don’ t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance\nuntil we ’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward\n2 percent. So, for example, let me take a path : If we did have a path where inflation proves\nmore persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong , but inflation is moving\nsideways and we’ re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could\nbe appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.\nI think there ’s also other paths that the economy could take , which , which would cause us\nto want to consider rate cuts . And those would be —two of those paths would be that we do gain\ngreater confidence, as we ’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent , and\nanother path could be , you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example. So\nthose are paths in which you could see us cutting rates. So I think it really will depend on the data. In terms of peak rate, you know, I think , really , it’s the same question . I, I think the dat a\nwill have to answer that question for us.\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. And could you just follow —on the path where you might\nnot cut, is that —you mentioned that would be inflation persistent —I mean, is inflation —would\nthat be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, it ’s, it’s—we ’ve set ourselves a test that we —for us to begin\nto reduce policy restriction, we ’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,\nmoving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure , one of the things we ’d be looking at is the\nperformance of inflation. We’d also be looking at inflation expectations . We’d be looking at the\nwhole story . But clearly, incoming , incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that\ndecision.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, to what\nextent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in\ngrowth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed\nto resume the sort of disinflation the e conomy saw last year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it ’s hard to know that. I think we ’ll be able to look back,\nyou know, from down the road and look back and understand it better. You know, i f you look\nat—let ’s look at growth. R eally , what we ’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth\ncoming in about consistent with where it was last year. I know GDP came in lower , but you\ndon’t see an acceleration in growth . I mean , the thought would be that financial conditions\nloosened in, in, December , and that caused an uptic k in activity , and that caused inflation.\nPresumably , that’s what we ’re tightening in the labor market. You don’ t really see that\nhappening. What you see is economic activity at a level that ’s roughly the same as , as last year.\n\nSo, you know, what ’s causing this inflation ? You know, we ’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that\nover time . I don’ t know that there ’s an obvious connection there , though, with easing of\nfinancial conditions. In terms of tightening, you ’re, you’re right . Rates are certainly higher now\nand have been for some time than they were before the December meeting . And they’ re higher ,\nand that ’s tighter financial conditions . And, you know, that ’s appropriate , given what inflation\nhas done in the first quarter.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’ t necessarily\npreclude rate cuts. I wonder , would continued strength in the labor market change your view\nabout the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was\nreaccelerating ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I just want to be careful that we don ’t target wage growth or the\nlabor market . And remember what we saw last year : very strong growth, a really tight labor\nmarket, and a historically fast decline in inflation. So—and that ’s because we know there are\ntwo forces at work here . There’s the unwinding of the pandemic -related supply- side distortions\nand demand -side distortions, and there ’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary\npolicy. So I wouldn’ t rule out that something lik e that can continue . You know, I wouldn’ t give\nup, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because , you know, we do\nsee that companies still report that there are supply -side issues that they ’re facing . And also ,\neven when the supply- side issues are solved , it should take some time for that to affect economic\nactivity and ultimately inflation. So there are still those things. So I don’ t like to say that either\nstrong—either growth or , or a strong labor market , in and of itself , would automatically create\nproblems on inflatio n, because , of course , it didn’ t do that last year.\n\nYou ask about wages . We also don ’t—we don’ t target wages. We target price inflation.\nIt is one of the inputs . The point with wages is , of course , we, like everyone else, like to see high\nwages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation. A nd that ’s really what we ’re\ntrying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what ’s happening on the supply side to\nbring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation. Part of that will probably be having\nwage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell . Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is\nsustainably moving back down to 2 percent . It’s May now . Do you have time this year to cut\nthree times, just given the calendar?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . I’m not really thinking of it that way. You know, the —what\nwe said is that we need to be more confident , and we ’ve said —my colleagues and I today said\nthat we didn ’t see progress in the first —in the first quarter . And I’ve said that it appears , then,\nthat it’ s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence . So I don’ t know how long\nit’ll take . You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in\nscope . And I don’ t know exactly when that will be.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on\nnow, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more\nworrying than just expected bumpiness?\nCHAIR POWELL. I —you know, not really . You know, what , what —so I thought it was\nappropriate to reserve judgment until , until we had the full quarter ’s data, until we saw the March\ndata. And so take a step back . What do we now see in the first quarter? We see strong economic\n\nactivity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation. We see three inflation readings , and\nso I think you’ re at a point there where you should take some signal. We don’ t like to react to\none or two months ’ data, but this is a full quarter . And I think it ’s appropriate to take signal now,\nand we are taking signal. And the signal that we ’re taking is that it ’s likely to take longer for us\nto gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. That’s the\nsignal that we ’re taking now . Yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chair, if I could —Steve Liesman, CNBC. If I could follow up\non that : What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first\nquarter? What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and\nquarters?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we will —you know, we will put the thing —we have put\nthe thing under a microscope. I will say , nothing is going to come out of that that ’s going to\nchange the view . I think that, in fact, we didn’ t gain confidence and that it ’s going to take longer\nto get that confidence —but—confidence. I just think —you know the story . What’s happened\nsince December is you’ ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ ve seen higher\nnonhousing services inflation than expected. A nd those two are working together to, to sort of be\nhigher than we had thought. And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know,\nwe—I think —I thin k my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation\nmove back down. That’s, that’s my forecast . I think my confidence in that is lower than it was\nbecause of the data that we’ ve seen. So, you know, we ’re looking at th ose things . We also\ncontinue to expect, and I continue to expect , that housing services inflation, given where market\nrents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time. We believe that it\n\nwill. I t just —it looks like the lag— that there are substantial lags between when , you know,\nlower market rates turned up and —for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or\nfor in -housing services.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea\nthat you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you ’re holding\nrates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t say that . No. I mean , the active tool of monetary policy\nis, of course , the interest rates . And this is —this is a long—a plan we ’ve long had in place to\nslow, really not in order to , you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be\nless restrictive to the economy . It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance\nsheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’ t wind up in —wi th financial\nmarket turmoil the way it did the last —the las t time we did this and the only other time we ’ve\never done this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Two questions . First, a simple one .\nGiven the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased\nor stayed the same? That’s the first question. Second question. Chair Powell, you joined the\nBoard in 2012, and I ’m sure you remember , as I do , what the jobless recovery was like : lawyers,\naccountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’ t get jobs. And given your history\nthere, I wonder if there ’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here. We have strong\nproductivity growth that ’s helping wages grow up—go up. W e have good employment . And so\nit seems to me there ’s a lot of hysteria about inflation. I agree —you know, nobody likes it, but is\n\nthere an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over\ntime? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on your first question, I don’ t have a probability estimate for you.\nBut all I can say is that , you know, we ’ve said that we didn’ t think it would be appropriate to cut\nuntil we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent . We\ndidn’ t get our confidence , in that [it] didn’ t increase in the first quarter . And, in fact, what really\nhappened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence. And I think\nthere are—you know, I think it’s —the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to\npredict —to predict its path . But there are paths to , to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.\nIt’s really going to depend on the data.\nIn terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our ,\nour sort of framework document says that , when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of\nthem is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one. It actually —it’s the\ntime to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal. And that was\nclearly inflation. So our focus was very much on inflation. As—and this is what we referred to\nin the statement . As inflation has com e down, now to below 3 percent on a —on a 12- month\nbasis, it ’s become —we ’re now focusing [ on] the other goal . The employment goal now comes\nback into focus. And so we are focusing on it. And, a nd that ’s how we think about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask\nthe questions. Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that ’s going to allow you to have a situation where\nrates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now. It’d be good if you could just\n\nconfirm whether or not that ’s a correct reading. And the Q1 GDP print has led to some —some to\nstart mentioning the term “ stagflation ” with respect to the U.S. economy. Do you or anyone else\non the FOMC think this is now a risk? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . I’m not dealing really in likelihoods. I think there are —there\nare paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’ t.\nAnd I don’ t have great confidence in which of those paths —I think I would say my personal\nforecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year. I don’ t know that it\nwill be enough, sufficient. I don’ t know that it won’ t. I think we ’re going to have to let the data\nlead us on that .\nIn terms of your question—your second question was stagflation. I guess I would say I\nwas around for stagflation, and it was , you know, 10 percent —10 percent unemployment . It was\nhigh single -digits inflation . Right now we have —and very slow growth—so right now we have\n3 percent growth, which is , you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we\nhave inflation running under 3 percent. So I don’ t—I don’t really understand where that ’s\ncoming from. And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that\nlast year ’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in , I guess, the fourth quarter , you know —\nand probably not going to be sustained and would come down. But that would be —that would\nbe our forecast. That wouldn’ t be stagflation. That would still be to a very healthy level of\ngrowth. And, of course , with inflation, you know, our —we will return inflation to 2 percent, and\nthat won’ t be—so I don’ t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The Vice\nChair of the FOMC said recently that he’ s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has\n\nmoved up. A nd, of course , he’s “Mr. Potential Growth /r*.” Do you share that view , and would\nthat imply that maybe policy isn ’t tight enough?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of\nvery high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of , I think , negative productivity\ngrowth in 2022. S o I think it ’s hard to draw from the data . I mean , the question is , will\nproductivity run—there are two questions . One is: Will productivity run persistently above its\nlonger -run trend? I don’ t think we know that. In terms of potential output, though, that ’s a\nseparate question . We’ve had a —what amounts to a , a significant increase in the potential output\nof the economy that ’s not about productivity . It was about having more labor, frankly, both\nthrough—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration. So we ’re very\nmuch—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for\npotential output this year and next year —and last year for that matter , too. So I think —in that\ncase, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ ve also got —so\nyou’ve got more supply . But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.\nSo you’ ve also got demand. So it—there may be —it may be that you get more supply than you\nget demand at the beginning, but , ultimately , it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary\nover, over a longer period.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. You said earlier that , at this point , you’ re not really considering\nrate increases. If growth is higher , but you’ re not considering rate increases, does that imply that\nyou’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation\ntaking off again?\nCHAIR POWELL. No . I think we , we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is\nappropriate to the current situation. We believe it ’s restrictive, and , you know, we —our evidence\n\nfor that, I went over earlier . You see it in the labor market . You see it in inflation -sensitive\nspending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years. And that ’s, that’s\nmore from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the\nsupply side. So that ’s how I would think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from F ox\nBusiness. So GDP growth is about 2 percent . Inflation —[Un] employment is about 4 percent . It\nfeels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation . So if the data remains the same\nthat you ’re seeing, and I know you said you don’ t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you\nwould need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation. So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today’ s meeting , and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest\nof the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, of course we ’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “ Three\npercent ” can’t be in a sentence with “ satisfied. ” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to\n2 percent over time but over time. And we think our policy stance is , is appropriate to do that.\nSo if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates. We\ndon’t see that . We don’ t see evidence for that. So that ’s where we are.\nEDWARD LA WRENCE. Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do\nabout , about holding the current —the current level of restriction. That’s really —that’s part of the\npolicy . That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. I wanted to follow [ up] on the 3 percent . Is there a time frame\nof persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?\nCHAIR POWELL. There isn ’t any rule . You can’t look to a rule . You know, t hese are—\nthese are going to be judgment calls. You know, c learly restrictive monetary policy needs more\ntime to do its job. That, that is pretty clear , based on what we ’re seeing . How long that will take\nand how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook\nevolves.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a with Politico. You’ve talked about your\ncommitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan. A nd I was just wondering, given that it ’s an\nelection year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election ? And, similarly, is there a\nsignificant economic difference between , you know, starting to cut in , say, September versus\nDecember?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for\nthe economy is when we come to that consensus view that it ’s the right thing to do for the\neconomy. That’s our record . That’s what we do. We’re not looking at anything else . You know,\nit’s hard enough to get the economics right here. These are difficult things , and if , if we were to\ntake on a whole , another , set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood\nwe’d actually get the economics right. So that ’s how we think about it around here. And, you\nknow , we’re at peace over it. We know that we ’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we\nthink it ’s the right thing . And we ’ll all do that. And that ’s, that’s how everybody around here\nthinks. So I can ’t say it enough, that we just don’ t—we just don’ t go down that road. If you go\ndown that road, where do you stop? And, and so we ’re not on that road. W e’re on the road\n\nwhere we ’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and\nhow those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. And then, is there a significant difference between , you know,\nwhether you start in , say, September versus December ?\nCHAIR POWELL. There ’s—\nVICTORIA GUIDA. A n economic difference .\nCHAIR POWELL. —a significant difference between an institution that takes into\naccount all sorts of political events and one that doesn’ t. That’s where the significant difference\nis, and, you know, we’re —we just don’ t do that. I mean , you can go back and read the\ntranscripts for every —this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here . Read all the\ntranscripts , and see if anybody mentions , in any way, the pending election. It just isn ’t part of\nour thinking. It’ s not what we ’re hired to do. If we start down that road, again, I don’ t know\nhow you stop. So.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Question about the labor market —\nyou’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing . Certainly , today ’s JOLTS\ndata suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre -pandemic levels. One thing that hasn’ t\nnormalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic. I wonder\nif you can share your analysis of , of why that ’s happening. Is it a lagging indicator, or is\nsomething else going on?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think if you go back to where wages peaked— wage increases\npeaked a couple , three years ago —essentially all wage measures have come down substantially\n[when compared] to that. But they are not , not down to where they were before the pandemic.\n\nThey ’re still roughly a percentage point higher. And we ’ve seen pretty consistent progress but\nnot uniformly . And you’ ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was —it was expected to be —to\nhave come down, and, essentially , it was flat year over year , you know, I think roughly . So yeah,\nI mean , it’s—that part of it is bumpy . And, again , we don’ t target wage increases, but , you know,\nin the longer run, if you have —if you have wage increases running higher than productivity\nwould warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures. Employers will raise prices\nover time if that ’s the case. S o we ’ve seen progress. I t has been inconsistent, but we have seen a\nsubstantial decline overall . But we have a ways to go on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Scott. Nancy. I’m sorry.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hey, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer from\nMarketplace. You mentioned consumers , and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates\nright now. Mortgage rates are up , as are rates for car loans, credit cards. P eople looking to\nborrow are very discouraged. T hat’s reflected in their views on the economy. What would you\nsay to them?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the thing that hurts everybody , and particularly people in the\nlower -income brackets, is inflation. If you’ re a person who’ s living paycheck to paycheck, and\nsuddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life —go up in price, you, you are in\ntrouble right away. And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’ re doing is , we’re\nusing our tools to bring down inflation. It will take some time, but we will succeed . And we will\nbring inflation back down to 2 percent , and t hen people won’ t have to worry about it again.\nThat’s what we ’re doing, and we know that it ’s painful and inconvenient . But the dividends will\nbe paid and will be very large . And, and everyone will share in those dividends , and we ’ve made\nquite a lot of progress if you can think about it. I think core—I think headline —core PCE\n\n[inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent]. N ow it ’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1. N ow it ’s at 2.7.\nDon’t want to get that wrong.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. No, you don’ t. Quick follow -up—are current interest\nrates really doing that much , though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean , I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is\ndoing what it ’s supposed to do, and it’s —but it ’s also , in this case unusually , working alongside\nand with the healing of the supply side. This, this —what was different this time was that a big\npart of the source of the inflation and the reason why we ’re having this conversation is that we\nhad this supply- side kind of collapse , with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.\nAnd so—and this was to do with the shutt ing down and reopening of the economy and other\nthings that , that really raised demand. So, many factors did that. So I think now you see those\ntwo things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the\npandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy . Those two things are\nworking to bring down inflation, and we ’ve made a lot of progress. Let’s remember how far\nwe’ve come. And we have a ways to go. W e’ve got work left to do, but we ’re not looking at the\nvery high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Thanks for taking our\nquestions, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing\ninflation . There’s kind of been this long- awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn ’t arrived.\nSo I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private -\nsector data we’ re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be\nhelpful on the inflation front in the coming months?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So, essentially , there are—there are a number of places in the\neconomy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process , and housing is one of\nthem. So when you have —when , when someone goes to —a new person goes to rent an\napartment, that ’s called market rent , and you can see market rents are barely going up at all. The\ninflation in those has been very low. But it takes —before that , they were incredibly high. T hey\nsort of led the , the high part. So what happens is , those market rents take years, actually , to get\nall the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases. Landlords don’ t tend to\ncharge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant , for whatever reason. A nd what that does is it\nbuilds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases . And\nwhat happens is , you know —it’s complicated , but the story is it just takes some time for that to\nget in. Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in\nmeasured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low. How— what will be the exact\ntiming of it? I think we ’ve learned that the lags are longer . We now think significantly longer\nthan we thought at the beginning, and so confident t hat it will come but not so confident in the\ntiming of it. But, yes, I expect that , that this will happen.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick Jasinski .\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions. This is\nNicholas Jasinski from Barron’ s Magazine. It seems that over the past three or four years ,\neconomies and central banks in developed markets , at least , have been on more or less the same\ntrajectory : easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out .\nIt feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well. So my question is, what , what\n\nconsiderations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central\nbank policies present for the FOMC?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that —you’ re right . I think that, that may happen, and, you know\nthat we all serve domestic mandates, right? So I think the difference between the United States\nand other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’ re just not having the kind of\ngrowth we ’re having. They have —their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little\nbetter, but they’ re not experiencing the kind of growth we ’re experiencing. So we actually have\nthe luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job\ncreation, and all of that, and we can be patient . And we will —we ’ll be careful and cautious as\nwe approach the decision to cut rates, w hereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.\nIn terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming. I t’s\npriced in now . And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to i t. And I think, you know,\nwe haven ’t seen —in addition , for the emerging market economies, we haven’ t seen the kind of\nturmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago. A nd that ’s, I think, partly because\nemerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation . And so they’ re na vigating this pretty well this time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to\nencounter pain for inflation to come back down. But , given the sticky inflation data in the first\nquarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy , or is some\nsoftening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right . I think we thought, and most people thought, there\nwould have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor\nmarket, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of this episod e. That didn’ t happen. T hat’s a tremendous result . We’re very , of course , gratified\nand pleased that that hasn ’t happened. And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it\nreally was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren ’t\nto do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know,\nsupply problems —supply- side problems and also some , some demand issues as well. The\nunwinding of those really helped inflation come down. Now, as I ’ve said, I ’m not giving up on\nthat. So I think —I think it is possible that , that those forces will still work to help us bring\ninflation down. We can ’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that ’s true , though. And so we ’re—you\nknow, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy\nstrong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably. We will bring inflation\ndown to 2 percent sustainably . We hope we can do it without , you know, without significant\ndislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In\nterms of cutting , you said, if there were weakness in the job market , that could be a reason to cut\nrates. So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to\nyour 2 percent target, how would you look at that? Would the unemployment rate popping back\nabove 4 percent catch your attention?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I said “ an unexpected weakening” is what I —the way I\ncharacterize d it. So , you know —and I ’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.\nBut, you know , it would be —it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to\n\nthink that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it. A\ncouple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be —would probably not do that . But a\nbroader —it would be a broader thing that would —that would suggest that it would be\nappropriate to consider cutting. I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and\ncircumstances, not just that one.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with\nAmerican Banker. You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III\nEndgame proposal , and you’ ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that ’s on the table. As\nyou’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the\noptions available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re- proposal will be necessary,\nand do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on\nthat front— either a re -proposal or a move to finalize?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me —let me start by saying that the F ed is committed to , you\nknow, completing this process and carrying out Basel III E ndgame in a way that ’s faithful to\nBasel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing. We\nhaven’ t made any decisions on , on policy or on process at all . Nothing. Nothing. N o decisions\nhave been made. I’ll say again , though, if we conclude that re -proposal is appropriate, we won’t\nhesitate to insist on that.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in\norder to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda , or do you expect to continue to make\nprogress on those other agenda items? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know , there’s no mechanical rule in place there. B ut I would say\nthat the , you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is , I think ,\noccupying us at this time in terms of what’ s, what’s —what we ’re moving ahead with.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Mr. Chairman, what\ncan you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve\nconsensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or\neven dissent ? We don’ t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more\nspirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact. How do you avoid groupthink and\navoid a higher risk of a policy mistake? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues\non the FOMC, you’ ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives. We\nreally don’ t. And it ’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System. We have\n12 R eserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people\nwho work here at the Board. T here are different people. You know, and so each , each Reserve\nBank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing. It\nguarantees you a diversity of perspectives. So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.\nBut—and, in terms of —in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents. A nd, you\nknow, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing. But all I can say from my standpoint is I try —I listen carefully to people . I try to incorporate\ntheir thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we ’re doing . And I\nthink many people , if they feel that’ s happening, you know, that for most people most of the\n\ntime, that’ ll be enough. A nd—but I ’m not —I mean , it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or\nillegal or against the rules or anything like that. It just is the way things come out .\nAnd I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people —frankly , more\ndiverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and\ndemographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D . economists . So we have\npeople from business and law and academia and things like that. So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective. I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity ,\nand we look around the room and say, “ I don’ t understand. I really don’ t understand what\nthey’ re talking about.” So—but I get the question, though. Thank you very much."
