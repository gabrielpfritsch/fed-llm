  "text": "March 2 0, 2019\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will begin with an\noverview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at\ntoday’s meeting.\nMy colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with\na strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The U.S. economy\nis in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.\nThe jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or\nremain in the workforce. The unemployment rate is near historic low s, and inflation remains\nnear our 2 percent goal. We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid\npace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018. We believe that our\ncurrent policy stance is appropriate.\nSince last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the\nworld that bear close attention. Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my\ncolleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of pol icy may be\nneeded. Let me explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a\nwait-and-see approach to changes.\nWith the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong —in\nfact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest year in more than a decade. For some time, most forecasts have\ncalled for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace. For example,\nlast September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 perce nt this year.\nData arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than\nexpected. Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter. While conditions\n\nPage 2 o f 23\nhave eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018. Growth\nhas slowed in some foreign economies —notably , in Europe and China. While the U.S. economy\nshowed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this\nyear have been somewhat more mixed. Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was\nfollowed by little growth at all in February. Smoothing through these variations, average\nmonthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains\nremain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants. Many other\nlabor market indicators continue to show strength. Weak retail sales data for December bounced\nback considerably in January but , on balance , seem to point to somewhat slower growth in\nconsumer spending. Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than\nlast year. Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer -term inflation expectations\nremain at the low end of their ranges in recent years. Along with these developments,\nunresolved policy issues , such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations , pose some risks to\nthe outlook.\nMuch of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varie d\nindicators. Today’s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of\nindividual Committee participants. And these views are in line with a broad range of other\nforecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remai ning favorable. FOMC\nparticipants sought —now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unem ployment rate\nremaining below 4 percent. Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy\nprices, remains close to 2 percent. Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push\nheadline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary. Now , I’m\n\nPage 3 o f 23\ndescribing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth\nand inflation this year could be stronger or wea ker than what we now project.\nThe federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral —the rate that\ntends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy. As I noted, my colleagues and I think that\nthis setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing\nthe need for any change in the stance of policy. “Patient ” means that we see no need to rush to\njudgment. It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a\nchange in policy.\nIn discussing the Committee’s projections, it’s useful to note what those projections are,\nas well as what they are not. The SEP includes participants’ individual projections of the most\nlikely economic sc enario , along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate\nin that scenario. Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy\ndiscussions. We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worr isome\noutcomes. These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not\nreflected in projections of the most likely case. Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate\nprojections in the SEP are not a Committee decision. They are not a Committee plan. As Chair\nYellen noted some years ago, t he FOMC statement , rather than the dot plot, is the device that the\nCommittee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates .\nToday the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans —\nrevised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans . We have long said that the size of the\nbalance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest\nlevel consistent with conductin g monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We have sought to\nmake the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize\n\nPage 4 o f 23\ndisruption and risks to our dual -mandate objectives. Today’s announcement is the result of\ndiscussi ons over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals. The plans\nhave many technical details, and I’ll be happy to answer questions on those details . But, for\nnow, I’ll summarize the key elements.\nSince October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not\nreinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid. Today we\nannounced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff\nentirely in September of this year.\nIn September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct\npolicy efficiently and effectively. If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings\nroughly constant for a time. During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our\nother nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances. When the\nCommittee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to\nrise, as dictated by the grow th of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities. We believe\nthat these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make\nadditional adjustments if conditions warrant.\nThe Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the\ndesired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities. We maintain our long-\nstated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities.\nThank you. And I will be glad to take your questions.\nHEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. On the broader economy,\ncan you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown? Some of the actions today\n\nPage 5 o f 23\nlook like there is more worry . And on the balance sheet, can you clar ify: Does the FOMC see\nthe runoff as a form of monetary tightening?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one. So, as I mentioned,\nFOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what\nwe saw back in —at the end of last year. And part of that is seeing that economic\nfundamentals —underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong. You have a strong labor\nmarket by most measures. You have rising incomes. You ’ve got very low unemployment. You\nhave confiden ce surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and\nyou also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of\nmonths ago. So we see the outlook as a positive one.\nAs far as balance sheet —the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether\nthat’s related to our monetary policy , in effect, and the answer is really “ no.” We are—we still—\nwe think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of\nourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months .\nAnd we ’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how\nglobal developments are affecting the U.S.? What ’s the cause of the weakness over there? How\nmuch is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here ? And what impact are tariffs , both in\nthe United States and retal iatory tariffs , having on both the U.S. and the global economies?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017.\nThat was the year of synchronized global growth. And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for\nmore of the same. What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow,\n\nPage 6 o f 23\nand now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially —and so has\nthe Chinese economy, although the European economy more. And just as st rong global growth\nwas a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy. How big is that\neffect? It ’s hard to be precise about it, but , clearly , we will feel that. It is an integrated global\neconomy, and global financial markets are int egrated as well.\nIn terms of what ’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things. In China , you\nhave, you know, factors that are very specific to China. The main point , though, is that, I would\nsay, the outlook—let ’s look at the outlook. Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the\nmiddle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that , ultimately ,\nChinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level. And in Europe, you know, we see some\nweakening, but, again, we don’ t see—we don’ t see recession, and w e do see positive growth still.\nYou ask about tariffs. I would say , tariffs may be a factor in China. I don’ t think they ’re\nthe main factor. I think the main factors are the de levering campaign that th e government\nundertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer -term slowing to a more sustainable pace\nof growth that economies find as they mature. In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs\nis relatively small in the size of our economy —relative to the size of our economy. We have,\nsince the beginning of the year —and before , really —been hearing from our extensive network of\nbusiness contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported\nproducts , and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry , so there ’s a\nfair amount of uncertainty. It’s hard to say how much of an effect that ’s having on our economy.\nIt’s very hard to tease that apart . But I will say , it’s been a prominent concern among our\nbusiness contacts for some time now.\n\nPage 7 o f 23\nJAMES PUZZANGHERA. Hi. Thank you, Chairman. I want to switch gears\ntemporarily to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a\n5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various\nconsumer abuse and reports that new consumer -unfriendly sales incentives are returning. Do\nyou have concerns about Wells Fargo ’s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset\ncap to remai n in place beyond this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Wells Fargo. So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a\nremarkably widespread series of breakdowns , really , in their risk -management apparatus, which\nresulted in significant consumer abuses , let’s say. And as it’s gone on and on, it ’s become clear\nthat—I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be\naddressed in a fundamental kind of a way. So there ’s a lot of work to do on that . And we put in\nplace, really , an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift\nthat until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those\nplans, and we ’re satisfied with what they ’ve done. And that ’s not where we are right now.\nJAMES PUZZANGHERA. Do you believe it ’s appropriate —do you believe it ’s\nappropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions , in terms of\ncorporate governance?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its\nrisk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach. We don’ t approve\nindividual pay packages. We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of\ncompensation practices that don’ t reward short -term risk -taking and that sort of thing. And w e\nwill supervise based on that.\n\nPage 8 o f 23\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. I wonder\nif you could discuss the balance of risks. I know you said that the outlook among the C ommittee\nmembers is a positive one, but since the end o f the meeting, the 3- month– 10-year Treasury\nspread has fallen to 7 basis points, and now, according to f ed funds futures trading, there ’s a\n50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January. How far off are the market s? W hat do you\nthink the risks actually are?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to\nmove in one direction or another, in my view. I would say it this way : We see a positive\noutlook for this year, a favorable out look for this year, as I mentioned. So, in our SEP\nprojections, C ommittee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent. They\nsee unemployment remaining below 4 percent. They see inflation remaining close to target.\nAnd they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent. So, you know, that ’s a positive outlook. It’s a\nfavorable outlook. We ’re also very mindful —and we have been, of course, all along —of what\nthe risks are. And you see —you mentioned some of them . You know , you see slowing global\ngrowth. You still have —there’ s no resolution of Brexit. There’ s no resolution, really , of the\ntrade talks. These are ongoing risks. We ’re also carefully monitoring what ’s happening with\nU.S. growth. We called that out in our st atement. You know, the limited data that we have do\nshow a slowdown. On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic\nfundamentals for growth this year as still very positive. So that ’s really how we’ re thinking\nabout it.\nJIM TANKERSLEY. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Tankersley, New York Times. I’m curious,\nyou’re now a full percentage point —actually , more than a percentage point —below the White\nHouse in your projections for growth this year. By my calculations, that ’s the largest spread\n\nPage 9 o f 23\nwe’ve seen since the end of the recession b etween the White House and the F ed. Why, for one,\ndo you see —do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at\nall about imp lications for policy from that?\nCHAIR POWELL. I haven ’t—I haven ’t seen their projection. I wouldn’ t comment on\ntheir projection. I would take it this way. You can think of growth as being composed of two\nthings. And one is really growth in the workforce —more hours worked. And the other is\nproductivity —it’s output per hour. You can really think of growth as those two things. And I ’ve\nbeen calling —often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national -level policies\nto support higher labor force participation. The United States is now one of t he lowest countries\namong the advanced economies , in terms of our labor force participation by prime -age workers.\nAnd that ’s a place where we can grow faster. If we can bring more people into the labor force\nand give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a\ngreat thing for the country. So I would like to see that.\nProductivity is much harder. It’s v ery difficult to project productivity over long stretches\nof time. It’s a function of evolving technology. So , I guess I would say, what is the potential\ngrowth rate? It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you\nknow, undertake an ef fort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be.\nJIM TANKERSLEY. A quick follow -up on that . Do you see the tax cuts —the 2017 tax\ncuts as having provided a large boost to labor force participation as the White House does ?\nCHAIR POWELL. I would say so. I think it ’s clear that the tax and spending policies\nthat were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year. And it ’s also\nthe case, I think, that they should have some supply -side effects. I think it ’s hard to know, it ’s\nhard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they ’re—we hope they ’re very large. You\n\nPage 10 o f 23\nknow, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment,\nwhich would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor\nforce participation. I wouldn’ t want to be handing —you know, assigning credit or blame for\nthat, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last , really , three or\nfour years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’ t see coming, and it ’s extremely\nwelcome.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. With the new\ndot plot today, you’ ve gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero. You still have one showing for\nnext year. The f ed funds futures trading , as has been alluded to, is showing rate cuts at the end\nof this year. Are they —is that a possibility in your mind , given the sharp change you’ ve made at\nthis meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. As I mentioned, the data that we ’re seeing are not currently sending a\nsignal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we ’re being patient.\nWe feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral. The economy is growing at about trend.\nInflation is close to target. Une mployment is under 3 percent.1 It’s a great time for us to be\npatient and watch and wait and see how things evolve.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. On stress testing, I wanted to\nask, how do you respond to criticism that the F ed’s recent move to remove the qualitative\nobjection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public? And then, also, Governor\nBrainard dissented on that decision, and she ’s dissented on some other decisions as well\nregulatorily recently. Does it concern you, given that the F ed has traditionally been a consensus -\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent.\n\nPage 11 o f 23\nbased organization, if you keep having thes e decisions where, you know, a B oard member is not\nonboard with them?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR . And U.S .—the\nlarge U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at\nthe capital planning process . And for , really , some time now, for a couple of years, we ’ve talked\nabout moving supervision of that process —moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than\nhaving a pass/fail in the stress tests . We ’ve been talking about that for quite a while . And I\nthink, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that . It shouldn’ t\nbe a big surprise —something we ’ve been talking a bout doing for a couple of years. For banks\nthat are newer to CCAR and haven ’t made that kind of progress, then they ’re still going to be\npart of —they ’re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach similar levels of\nachievement.\nIn terms of having disparate views, I —look, we try —we are very much a consensus -\ndriven organization. We try very hard to reach consensus on things. In the end, it ’s very healthy\nto have disparate v iews and to state them publicly and put them on the record. It’s nothing but\nhealthy from my standpoint. We ’ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I ’m\ncommitted to that.\nTREVOR HUNNICUTT. Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters. Just —you mentione d that\nyou have , kind of , a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the\nhousehold side and the business side. Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what\ngives you, kind of , confidence that both the slowdown we ’re seeing is temporary ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on\nretail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading . And, you know, it was a\n\nPage 12 o f 23\nsurprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a signif icant amount of other data. We ’re not\ndismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending ?\nIt’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out . It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals ,\nso, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job\ncreation , confidence. The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they\nwere last summer. So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks l ike a setting in\nwhich consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals. And that ’s\nreally what we’ re thinking there. So, you know, we ’re also patiently watching and waiting and\nnot assuming. We ’re not taking no signal from the incomi ng data ; that’s why we called it out in\nour statement. So I t hink our eyes are open on this.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in 1998 the\nFed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have\nhelped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble . And financial conditions have eased considerably\nthis year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January . The S&P, for example, is just\n3 percent below last summer ’s peak. And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear\nat all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environm ent of a\nshallower policy path?\nCHAIR POWELL. We ’re in a very different world today and post -crisis, because we\nnow very care fully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing\nbasis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meeting s and briefings\nwhere we look deeply into these things. So this is something we have very much on our radar\nscreen. And I would say , overall , we don ’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high. There\nare some aspects of the financial markets that we’ re carefully monitoring, and those are in the\n\nPage 13 o f 23\nnature o f things that might b e amplifiers to a downturn—as opposed to a financial stability\nconcern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don’ t see. So we\ndo monitor that .\nAnd I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and\nfinancial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world. We do think that the principal\ntools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential\ntools, and those sorts of things a s opposed to changing the interest rate. But we ’re certainly very\nmindful of financ ial conditions and those risks.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could ask a follow -up—i f it’s the case that we’ re in a lower\nneutral interest rate world where you could have more asse t price appreciation, do you think the\nFed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn’ t have to lean on monetary policy to do\nso much ?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s a very difficult question with a long answer. We —in our system,\nwe mainly rely on “ through the cycle ” tools like high capital and stress tests. Our financial\nstability system is built on those tools : high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress\ntesting. So those are always on. We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer,\nwhich we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. But we do\nrely on those tools. And I would say , our banks are well capitalized. They ’re far better\ncapital ized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial\ncrisis. So they ’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states o f the economy.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Included in the President ’s fiscal 2020\nbudget is a new estimate that the nation ’s debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the\nnext decade, by 2029. You’ ve previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.\n\nPage 14 o f 23\nHow alarming is that number to you ? And, while the United Sta tes might not be quite there yet,\nwhen do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis?\nCHAIR POWELL. I do think that deficits matter, and I do think— I think it ’s not really\ncontroversial to say that our debt can ’t grow faster than our economy indefi nitely and that ’s what\nit’s doing now. So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can ’t really lose\nsight of that, and I ’d like to see a greater focus on that over time. It’s not in the nature of a near -\nterm debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’ t want to try to predict when that would\nhappen, but it is something that it ’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I\ncan say that . And we will have to deal with it eventually.\nJAMES POLITI. James Politi of the Financial Times. There’ s huge uncertainty at the\nmoment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations. How much of a factor has this been for the F ed\nin turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what ’s your base case on\nthat? And on the size of the balance sheet, what ’s your —do you have a numerical estimate for\nwhere it will be at the end of Septemb er once the runoff is complete?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we ’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can\nbe resolved in an orderly way. From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that\nwe’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the\nUnited Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they ’re ready for the full range\nof possible outcomes to the —to Brexit. So —and in doing so, we ’ve also had —we ’ve also\nworked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU. So we do, again, hope that\nthat can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilien t to\ndifferent kinds of events.\n\nPage 15 o f 23\nIn terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of\napproximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at\nthe end of 2014—s o, significa ntly smaller relative to GDP than it was. I’m guess ing you’re\nlooking for a dollar number , though, probably, and that would be —so , for the size of the balance\nsheet, it looks like it’ ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketW atch. Chairman Powell, could you talk\nthrough your outlook for inflation this year? Aren’t —you’re not concerned about it ? And\nrising —why aren ’t risin g wages feeding into inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me take wages first, if I can. So wages have moved up in the last\ncouple of years and are now running at healthier , higher levels, and that ’s a good thing . In fact, a\nlot of the wage gains have been going to lower -paid workers , as can happen late in the cycle,\nwhich is also a good thing. So —but that ’s not price inflation , that’s wage inflation. Our\nmandate, sorry, is price inflation. So what I see is inflation that’ s close to 2 percent but that sort\nof keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit.\nAnd I don’t feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a\nsymmetrical way. Now, what do we mean by “ symmetrical” ? What we really mean is that we\nwould look at —we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we\nsay is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below\nthe target.\nSo that ’s really our framework . And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because\nwe’re really 10 years deep in this —almost 10 years —in this exp ansion, and inflation is still kind\nof, I’d say , not, you know, clearly meeting our target. So that ’s one of the reasons why we ’re\nbeing patient. I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target—\n\nPage 16 o f 23\nparticularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for\nmost of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too—t hat gives us\nthe ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being ac hieved.\nGREG ROBB. I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the C ommittee —\nyou know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is\nthe story that emerges?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there are a bunch of different stories. There ’s no real easy\nanswer. One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.\nThat’s one way to think about it, that there’ s still more slack in the economy. Another is tha t\nexpectations play a very —inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other\nframeworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations\nbeing anchored but below 2 percent. And so, either way, inflatio n itself has kind of bounced\naround a little below 2 percent. That ’s the record.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell . Thanks for the question. Paul Kiernan from\nDow Jones Newswires. I’m just kind of curious —I mean , this below -target inflation is a globa l\nphenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I’d just like to kind of hear your thoughts\nabout what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy\nin general. Ye s, thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s a major challenge. It’s one of the major challenges of our time,\nreally, to have inflation— you know, downward pressure on inflation, let ’s say. It gives central\nbanks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right ? So if inflation expectations a re\nbelow 2 percent, they ’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be\npaddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room\n\nPage 17 o f 23\nto cut, you know, when it’ s time to cut rates when the economy weak ens. And, you know, that ’s\nsomething that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too. It’s\none of the —one of the things we ’re looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review\nthis year. The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we\ncan, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we ’re open minded\nabout ways we can do that.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. So I counted\nfive downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement. What conditions do you need to\nsee in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , we—I think we were —we wanted to be careful to go ahead\nand acknowledge the things. I think it’ s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were\ncareful to point out lower retail sales —the weak November meeting —BFI, all those things , and I\nthink that was the right thing to do.2 Notwithstanding th at, we do have a positive outlook for the\nyear for the reasons I mentioned— you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera.\nSo, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’ t see any —we don’ t see data\ncoming in that suggest s that we should move in either direction. They suggest that we should\nremain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time. When the time comes, we ’ll act\nappropriately.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi. Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg. Fed Vice Chairman Rich\nClarida has talked about how the decline in labor ’s share of income and the corresponding high\nprofit margins might mean that lower unemployment and high er wage growth is not flowing\nthrough to price inflation the way it used to. Bu t, so far throughout this tightening cycle , the Fed\n\n2 Chair Powell intended to point to the weak reading on retail sales for December 2018.\n\nPage 18 o f 23\nhas not allowed wage growth to rise above longer -term interest rates until just very recently . So\nI’m wondering if , going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit\nmargins and t he linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage\ngrowth to continue accel erating without matching that with higher interest rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , let me say that we ’ve had, you know, a significant move up in\nwages and compe nsation over the last few years, and I —which does not trouble me from the\nstandpoint of inflation. We ’ve had —also had —in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you\nknow, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’ t lead to price inf lation. It\ndoes—you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins , and, you know, that can ’t go on\nindefinitely . But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concernin g from an\ninflation standpoint.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of\ninterest rates allows households to pay down debt faster , whereas interest rates in excess of wage\ngrowth risk s a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability\nconsequences of varyi ng interest rates relative to wage growth?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t think we look at —I understand what you’re asking, but we ’re\nlooking at —our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that ’s what we ’re\nlooking at with setting interest rates. And we also monitor financial stability very carefully\nacross all meaningful asset categories. I don’ t think we tie it particularly to the relationship\nyou’re talking about.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Just a\nquick foll ow-up on Brexit. You mentioned that you’re making sure that U.S. financial\ninstitutions are ready for whatever outcome. I’m wondering, can you be a little more specific\n\nPage 19 o f 23\nabout that ? And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexi t would put on\nthe U.S. dollar?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress test s that the largest\nfinancial institutions —and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally —that they\nundergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big\nchanges in markets every year. And we vary that every year. So that ’s a pretty good —you\nknow, having done that for a number of years now, that ’s—and having them be required to have\nadequate capital and li quidity even after all that happens. So that ’s a good thing to have done ,\nknowing that you’re going into something that ’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful , it\nmay not prove stressful , depending on what the outcome is. So I think all that has probably\nprepared our institutions well. That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so\nit’s really hard to be confident. So we ’re very watchful about what ’s going on.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. And as far as the dollar goes?\nCHAIR POWELL. S o we don’ t—you know, we —the dollar is really the business of the\nTreasury Department. It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models,\nbut we don’ t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies .\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi. John Heltman— John Heltman with American Banker. I have a\nquestion about the F ed’s proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential\nstandards for banks above $250 billion. Some analysts have suggested that tha t proposal could\nencourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks , particularly at the upper end of\nthe range. I’m curious if the F ed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any\nreservations or whether you—the F ed cares about ban k consoli dation more generally.\n\nPage 20 o f 23\nCHAIR POWELL. We ’re not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that\nwe’re trying to achieve through our regulation. I think we want to have banks of all different\nsizes and with different business models out there car rying out their functions in the economy.\nSo that ’s how we think about that.\nI would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get\nstronger regulation, not weaker regulation. So if you think about it, you know, if you’re a\nmedium -sized bank and you merge with another medium -sized bank, you w ind up being more\nthan a medium -sized bank, you know.\nBut the sense of our tapering is that —“tailoring, ” sorry —our tailoring policy is that the\nhighest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex\ninstitutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the\nrisks that that institution actually presents to the economy . So—\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Brian Ch eung wi th Yahoo Finance. Thanks for\ntaking my question. So as the F ed remains on pause, does the c entral bank find the onus on\nfiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and f end off a slowdown—as in , is the F ed\npositioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing ? I’m asking\nbecause we’re seeing the waning effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, s o\njust wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy –fiscal policy balance is in swing\nright now .\nCHAIR PO WELL. So we take—we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to\nwhat we do. You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that. We\ndon’t evaluate it , we don ’t criticize it, and we don ’t overreact to it either. So I think it’ s just a\nfact. It’s just an external fact about the economy for us. I mean , our policy is —the reason we ’re\n\nPage 21 o f 23\non hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good\nplace, and we’re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home,\nand we think that ’s what we need to be doing.\nSTEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr.\nChairman. The F ed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond portfolio to\nlengthen. Is this aimed at—consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to\nbe part of the Fed’s longer -run balance sheet strategy? And if flattening the yield curve is a\nconscious long- term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening\nconcerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession ?\nCHAIR POWELL. The basic answer to your question is “ no.” We are—the decision\nabout t he maturity composition of the F ed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us. We\nhave not made that decision, and we’re—we really haven ’t begun to have a serious series of\ndiscussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that. That, I think, will be something we\nturn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time. It’s a consequential decision and one\nthat needs some thought. We ’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the\nlast four meetings, but this is the next big one that—big decision that w e’ll face. And, you know,\nI think we ’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we ’ll turn to it soon.\nSTEVEN BECKNER. Can I just follow up, please? Well , how do you account for the\nfact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and co ntributing to a flattening of the\nyield curve? Is that —what’s —what ’s causing that?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think, isn ’t it just that as securities roll off , you wind up investing\nin—you know, as a 10- year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10- year, and automatically that\n\nPage 22 o f 23\nlengthens things. It’s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet. It’s just been —we try to\nhave a practice that we don’ t deviate from , and it’ s transparent , and—no policy message in that.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market New s. I wanted to ask, at what point do you\nexpect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again? What are—how will you make\nthat decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I —as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at\nabout —at September 30. A nd if it is our view at that time that we ’re still a ways away from—a\nways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary\npolicy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant. A nd then what ’ll happen is ,\norganically , very gradually , currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow , and reserves\nwill shrink.\nAnd the question you’re asking is , how long will that go on? The truth is, we don’ t\nknow, and we don ’t really know that we ’ll move past September 30th. The level of reserve\ndemand is something that we ’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates , based on\nmarket intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing. The truth is, we don’ t know. It may\nevolve over time. So we ’ll just have t o see. I wouldn’ t want to put a time out there for that,\nbut—so I’ll just leave it th ere.\nCOURTENAY BROWN . Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Are you\nconcerned at all what the market impact will be should the F ed resume policy tig htening\nsomewhere down the line? As I’m sure you know , the market lis tens to you very, very closely.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I ’m just going to say that I think we ’re in a good place\nright now, which is , we’re being patient, we ’re watching , we don’ t see any data pushing us to\n\nPage 23 o f 23\nmove rates in either direction, and we ’re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow\nevents to evolve . And when they do clar ify, we will act appropriately."
