We have both the tools that we need and the\nresolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price\nstability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without pric e stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price\nstability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis point s. And we continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance\npurposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some\ntime. I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing\neconomic development s.\nThe U.S. economy ha s slow ed significantly from last year’s rapid pace. Real GDP rose\nat a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter but is unchanged so far this year. R ecent indicators point to\nmodest growth of spending and production this quarter . Growth in consumer spending has\nslowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter\nfinancial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly , largely reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates. Higher intere st rates and slower output growth also appear to be\nweighing on business fixed investment .\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate at a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\n\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month\nover August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace\nof job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance,\nwith demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force\nparticipation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year .\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in September , total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent. And the recent inflation data again have come in\nhigher than expected. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional\nupward pressure on inflation.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s\nwell as measures from financial market s. But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the\ncurrent bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least abl e to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\nAt today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n75 basis point s. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our\nbalance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of mone tary policy.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 ¾ percentage points this year. W e\nanticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate\nin order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to\n2 percent over time. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest -rate-sensitive sectors of the\neconomy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. That’s why we say in our statement that i n determining the\npace of future increases in the target range , we will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and\ninflation . At some point —as I’ve said in the last two press conferences—it will become\nappropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go, and\nincoming data since our last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be\nhigher than previously expected. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and in flation. W e will continue to make\nour decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.\nWe are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment\nwith supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored . Reducing inflation\n\nis likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restor ing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against\nprematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done .\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to\nslow the pace of rate increases at some point : Is a downshift contingent on a string of better\ninflation data specifically between now and , let’s say , the December meeting? Or is that\nsomething that the F ed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged\neffects that you mentioned?\nCHAIR POWELL. So a couple things on that . We do need to see inflation coming down\ndecisively , and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course ,\nthat’s what we ’d all love to see, but that ’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for\nslowing the pac e of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we ’re\naiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. How w ill we know that\nwe’ve reached that level? Well, we’ ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that\nbear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation,\n\ntaking into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all\nacross the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I ’m sure there’ s going\nto be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you’ re going to slow in December or\nnot. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis poi nt increase?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of\nour broader tightening program , if I may , and talk about the statement language along the way.\nSo I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions , the\nfirst of which was , and has been, how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate .\nAnd the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level .\nSo on the first question —how fast to tighten policy—it ’s been very important that we\nmove expeditiously, and we have clearly done so . We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March,\nadmittedly from a base of zero. It’s a historically fast pace , and that ’s certainly appropriate given\nthe persistence and streng th in inflation and the low level from which we started.\nSo now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate . And\nwe’re saying that we’ d raise that rate to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to\nour 2 percent target over time , and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really\ndoes become the important question, we think now, is how far to go. A nd I’ll talk more about\nthat. We think there ’s some ground to cover before we meet that test , and that ’s why we say that\nongoing rate increases will be appropriate . And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the\nmeetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that\n\nwe may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting.\nThat level is very uncertain , though, and I would say we ’re going to find it over time.\nOf course , with the lags between policy and economic activity, there ’s a lot of\nuncertainty, so we note t hat in determining the pace of future increases, we ’ll take into account\nthe cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation. So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed become s less important than the second and\nthird questions . And that ’s why I ’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point , it\nwill become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming , and it may come\nas soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we ’ll\nhave a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear , let me say again\n[that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than\nthe question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which\nreally will be our princip al focus.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that , to what degree was there an\nimportance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns , really\naround the globe , about Fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their\nown stress as a result?\nCHAIR POWE LL. Well, I think I’ m pleased that we have moved as fast as we have. I\ndon’t think we ’ve overtightened. I think there ’s—very difficult to make a case that our current\nlevel is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the federal f unds r ate. So I think that\nat this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I’ ve mentioned, I ’ve said that we—that there\nwould come a point, and t his was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might\n\nmean . And we did discuss this , and, as I mentioned, we’ ll discuss it again in December. But\nthere ’s no— I don’ t have any sense that we’ ve overtightened or moved too fast. I think it’ s been\ngood and a successful program that we ’ve gotten this far this fast. Remember , though, that we\nstill think there ’s a need for ongoing rate increases , and we have some gr ound left to cover here ,\nand cover it we will.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, core PCE\ninflation on a 3- or 6- month annualized basis and on a 12- month basis has been running in the\nhigh 4s, close to 5 percent. Is there any reason to think you won’ t have to raise rates at least\nabove that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the question of , does the policy rate need to get above the\ninflation rate? And I would say, there are a range of view s on it . That ’s the classic “Taylor\nprinciple ” view. But I would think you’ d look more at a forward, a forward -looking measure of\ninflation to look at that. But I think the answer is , we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level\nwhere it is, where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as\nthe single and only touchstone , though. I think you put some weight on that ; you also put some\nweight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end —at the federal funds\nrate, for example . So households and businesses, if they’ re [borrowing] —[there are] very\nmeaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher , and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a\nbit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I ’d put some weight on it , but I wouldn’ t\nsay it ’s something that is the single , dominant thing to look at.\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up: W hat is your best assessment , or the staff ’s\nbest assessment right now , of the current rate of underlying inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t have a specific number for you there. There are many, many\nmodels that look at that . And, I mean , one way to look at it is that it ’s a pretty stationary object\nand that when inflation runs —above that level , for sure —substantially above for some time,\nyou’ll see it move up , but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that ’s what the\nprincip al models would tend to say. But I wouldn’ t want to land on any one assessment. There\nare many different —as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying\ninflation.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. T hank you for taking our questions. Jeanna\nSmialek with the New York Times. I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that\ninflation is , or is at risk of becoming , entrenched?\nCHAIR POWELL. Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by\npointing to expectations . So if we saw longer -term expectations moving up, that would be very\ntroubling. And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they ’ve\nmoved now back down. T hat’s one piece of data. Shorter -term inflation expectations moved up\nbetween the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’ t think those are as indicative , but they\nmay be important in the wage -setting process. There ’s a school of thought that believes that. So\nthat’s very concerning.\nI guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have —we ’re now 18 months into\nthis episode of high inflation , and we don’ t have a clearly identified , scientific way of\n\nunderstanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from\na risk -management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation\nunder control —get it down to 2 percent —get it behind us. That ’s what we really need to do and\nwhat we ’re strongly committed to doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel\nSiegel from t he Washington Post. The statement points to lag times . I’m wondering if you can\nwalk us through how you judge those lag e ffects, what that timeline looks like over the coming\nmonths or even a year , and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the\neconomy.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the way I would think about that is , it’s commonly, for a long\ntime, thought that monetary policy works with “ long and variable lags ,” and that it works first on\nfinancial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on\ninflation. So that ’s been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made\nthose lags out to be fairly long. There ’s newer literature that says that they ’re shorter. The truth\nis, we don’ t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high i n what is , now , the\nmodern economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the f ederal\nfunds r ate, financial conditions would react , and then that would affect economic activity and\ninflation. Now financial conditions react wel l before in expectation of monetary policy [actions] .\nThat’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century —in the direction of financial conditions ,\nthen monetary policy—because the markets are thinking , what is the c entral bank going to do?\nAnd there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the\neffects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don ’t know\n\nthat. I guess the thing that I would say is : It’s highly uncertain—highly uncertain. A nd so from\na risk -management standpoint —but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them .\nBut you want to consider them but not take them literally. So I think it ’s a very difficult place to\nbe, but I would t end to be —want to be in the middle looking carefully at what ’s actually\nhappening with the economy a nd trying to make good decisions from a risk- management\nstandpoint, remembering , of course , that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools\nstrongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’ t get inflation under control because we\ndon’t tighten enough, now we ’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the\ncosts, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially . So from a risk -\nmanagement standpoint, we want to be sure that we don’ t make the mistake of either failing to\ntighten enough or loosening policy too soon.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And if I could follow up: S hould we interpret the addition to the\nstatement to mean that more weight is put into those lag e ffects than they would have been after\nprevious rate hikes?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these\nongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it ’ll be appropriate now to be thinking\nmore about lags . Of course, we think about lag s—the lags are just sort of a basic part of\nmonetary policy . But we will be thinking about them , but we won’ t be—I think we ’ll be\nconsidering them but because it ’s appropriate to do so. Let me say this : It is very premature to\nbe thinking about pausing. So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause. It’s very\npremature , in my view , to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways\nto go. O ur policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.\nAnd we don ’t—of course , we don’ t really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and\n\nwe’ll write down in September—sorry, in the December meeting , a new S ummary of Economic\nProjections , which updates that. But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what\nwe’re seeing with incoming data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil Irwin.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell . Neil Irwin, Axios. As you look around the\neconomy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some\nventure -funded tech companies . It’s been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market,\nconsumer demand; a lot of sectors , you don’ t see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels\nthrough which monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on\nhousing in particular, are you at all worried that you’ re cramping housing supply in ways that\nmight cause problems down the road?\nCHAIR P OWELL. I don’ t know that the channels through which policy works have\nchanged that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market , and the labor market is very,\nvery strong. Very strong. And households , of course , have strong balance sheets. So w e go into\nthis with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through\nmany different things , and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it\nmay take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience. I t’s likely to, to get inflation down. It\nmay—I think you see , from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to\ncome down. It’ ll take time, we think. So , sorry, was I getting to your question there?\nNEIL IRWIN. Housing. CHAIR POWELL. Oh , housing—the housing part of it. Ye s, so we look at housing —of\ncourse, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global F inancial C risis—they ’re not historically high, but the y’re much higher\n\nthan they ’ve been. A nd you’ re seeing housing activity decline, and you’ re seeing housing prices\ngrowing at a faster rate and , in some parts of the country, declining. You know, I would say\nhousing was —the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the\npandemic as demand increased and rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated\nthe housing market was, prices going up. Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of\nthing. So the housing mar ket needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.\nWe’re well aware of what ’s going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn ’t see\nin this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the G lobal F inancial Cr isis.\nHousing credit was very carefully —much more carefully managed by the lenders . So it’s a very\ndifferent situation and doesn’ t present potential financial—doesn ’t appear to present financial\nstability issues. But , no, we do understand that that ’s really where a very big effect of our\npolicy is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA . Hi, Victoria Guid a with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor\nmarket. You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available\nworkers, and I ’m just curious to what extent you do and don’ t draw signal from that. So, for\nexample, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see —are wages what ’s\nreally important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we talk a lot about vacancies in the— vacancy -to-unemployed\nrate, but it’ s just one, it ’s just another data series. It’s been unusually important in this cycle\nbecause it ’s been so out of line. But so has quits. So have wages. So we look at a very wide\nrange of data on the unemployment —on the labor m arket. So I’d start with unemployment ,\n\nwhich is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50 -year low, 3½ percent . We’re\ngetting really nothing in labor supply now. We had , I think , very small increase this year , which\nwe had really thought, we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get\nsome labor supply coming in.\nYou mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture.\nIt’s true , with average hourly earnings , you see —so I would call it a flattening out at a level\nthat’s well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming\na reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline\nnumber was a disappointment . Let’s just say it was high. It didn ’t show a decline. There ’s\nsome rays of light inside that if you look at private -sector workers —that did come down, that\ncompensation did come down. Overall , though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor\nmarket where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds sort of the level\nthat would hold the market where it is. So that ’s the picture.\nDo we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is\nhappening. And maybe that ’s there, but it ’s not obvious to me , because wages aren ’t coming\ndown—they’ re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both E CI and average hourly earnings.\nWe want to see—we wou ld love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are\ncoming down. V acancies are below their all -time high but not by as much as we thought ,\nbecause—and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three. So it ’s a mixed picture. I don ’t see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I\nguess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.\nVICTORIA GUIDA . So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect\non wages. I think that’ s always been the case. There ’s always—going back and forth, the\nquestion is , is that really elevated right now? I don ’t think so. I don’ t think wages are the\nprinci pal story of why prices are going up. I don’ t think that. I also don ’t think that we see a\nwage –price spiral, but , again, it ’s not something you can—once you see it, you’ re in trouble. So\nwe don’ t want to see it. We wan t wages to go up —we just want them to go up at a level that ’s\nsustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation. And we think we can —we do think that ,\ngiven the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as\nhistory would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings\ndeclining . We think there ’s room for that. But we won ’t know that —that ’ll be, that ’ll be\ndiscovered empirically.\nKAYLA TAUSCHE. Thank you so much. Kayla Tausche f rom CNBC. Earlier last\nmonth, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn ’t\nchange course. The new U .K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And\nI’m wondering how the F ed is weighing inter national developments in light of a very strong\neconomy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , of course , we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and\nalso geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We’re in very frequent\ncontact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central b anks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers.\nSo we ’re in touch with all of that. So I guess what —it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the\nglobal economy. W e’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly be cause of high\nenergy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we ’re seeing China ’s having issues with the\n\nzero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we ’re used to seeing. So we ’re seeing —we\nsee those difficulties. T he strong dollar is a challenge fo r some countries. But we haven’ t—we\ntake all of that into account in our models . We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.\nHere in the United States , we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where\ninflation is running at 5 percent . Core PCE inflation —which is a really good indicator of what ’s\ngoing on for us , the way we see it —is running at 5.1 percent on a 12- month basis and sort of\nsimilar to that on a 3- , 6-, and 9- month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get\ninflation under control. The world’ s not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That ’s a task\nwe need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a\nlong period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for decades, hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back. G etting it back is something\nthat gives —that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.\nKAYLA TAUSCHE. If I could just follow up up on that —thank you. The F ed has\nacknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don’ t affect things like energy and food\nprices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they’ re some of the biggest pain\npoints for consumers. So as you pursue the current path that you’ ve outlined, is there a risk that\nsome of those prices simply don’ t come down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’ t directly affect , for the most part, food and energy prices,\nbut the demand channel does affect them just at the marg in. The thing about the United States is\nthat we also have strong —in many other jurisdictions , the principal problem really is energy. In\nthe United States , we also have a demand issue. We’ ve got an imbalance between demand and\nsupply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well suited to work on\nthat problem, and that ’s what we ’re doing. You ’re right, though. W e don’ t—the price of oil is\n\nset globally , and it ’s not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take , though, we\nhelp keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent\ninflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation\nis high.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Hi, Chair Powell. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So the F ed is\nfacing two more ethics -related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from\nPresident Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So some senators , like\nElizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the F ed. Could you\ntalk about what this does to the public ’s trust in the bank and what the F ed is doing to prevent\nthis kind of behavior from becoming common?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sur e. So you’ re right— the public ’s trust is really the F ed’s and any\ncentral bank ’s most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers , violates or\nfalls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriou sly. We\ndo. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday , actually, we had a C ommittee discussion of\nthe full C ommittee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively\naccountable for knowing and following the high standard that ’s set out in our existing rules with\nrespect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we ’ve taken a\nnumber of steps , and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would\nsay that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually , it was\nthrough that that the problems with President Bostic ’s disclosures were discovered , when he filed\nhis new disclosure . We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into\ndisclosures and follows them and approves people ’s disclosures and also all of their trades. Any\n\ntrade anyone has to make is covered , has to be approved, preapproved, and there ’s a lag —it has\nto be preapproved 45 days before it happens , so there ’s no ability to game market s. So it’s a\nreally good system . It worked here. And we —I think we all said to each other today —\nyesterday , actually, yester day morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to\nhold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t. So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President\nBostic to the inspector general , and once that happens, I don’ t discuss it with the i nspector\ngeneral or with anybody. It’s just —the inspector general has, he has the ability to do\ninvestigations . We don’ t really have that. So that ’s what he ’s doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier\nthis year , you touted the three -month bi ll yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100\npercent expl anatory power. And you said, quote , “If it’s inverted, that means the F ed’s going to\ncut, which means the economy is weak.” That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion\nnow, so I ’m wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened , particularly\ngiven that rates work with a lag.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so we do monitor the near -term forward spread —you’ re right.\nAnd it ’s—that ’s been our preferred measure. We think, just empirically , it dominates the ones\nthat people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that. So it ’s not inverted. And, also ,\nyou have to look at why things —why the rate curve is doing what it ’s doing. It can be doing that\nbecause it affects— it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if\nyou’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that ’s\n\ngoing to affect the forward curve . So, yes, we monitor it. Y ou’re right. And that’s what I\nwould say.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: Y ou also said several meetings ago that the\nrisk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you’ re trying to tell us\ntoday is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , what ’s happened is , time has passed , and we ’ve raised interest\nrates by 375 basis points. I would not —I would not change a word in that statement , though. I\nthink until we get inflation down, you’ ll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten—and\nwe don’ t want to, we want to get this exactly right —but if we overtighten, then we have the\nability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic\nepisode, we can support economic acti vity strongly if that happens, if that ’s necessary. On the\nother hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it ’s a\nyear or two down the road, and you’ re realizing , inflation behaving the way it can, you ’re\nrealizing you didn’ t actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk , really , is that it has\nbecome entrenched in people ’s thinking. A nd the record is that the employment costs —the cost\nto the people that we don’ t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time. That ’s really how\nI look at it. So that isn ’t going to change. What has changed , though—you’ re right —is, we’re\nfarther along now. And I think as we ’re farther along, we ’re now focused on t hat. What’s the\nplace, what ’s the level we need to get to rates? And I don’ t know what we ’ll do when we get\nthere, by the way. I t doesn’ t—we ’ll have to see. There ’s been no decision or discussion around\nexactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\n\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Just to\ngo back to housing for a minute : You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on\nhousing—h ome sales are down 25 percent in the past year , and so forth —but none of this is\nreally showing up in, as you know, in the government ’s inflation measures. And as we go\nforward, private real -time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to\nput a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there ’s overtightening going\non, or will you still focus as much on the more lagg ing government indicators?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying, I guess , that the\nmeasure that ’s in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And\nthat makes sense, actually , because fo r that reason —conceptually , that is —that ’s sort of the right\ntarget for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners ’ equivalent rent , which comes\noff of —it’s a reweighting of tenant rents.\nThe private measures are, of course , good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases,\nand they tell you a couple things . One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of\nthat series of the new leases, it ’s very pro- cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and\nPCE rents did. And now they’ re coming down faster. B ut what you’ re—the implication is that\nthere are still , as people, as non -new leases roll over and expire, right , they ’re still in the pipeline,\nthere ’s still some significant rate increases coming , okay? But at some point, once you get\nthrough that, the new leases are going to tell you —what they ’re telling you is , there will come a\npoint at which rent inflation will start to come down. B ut that point is well out from where we\nare now. So we ’re well aware of that , of course , and we look at it. B ut I would say that in terms\nof—the right way to think about inflation , really , is to look at the measure that we do look at, but\nconsidering tha t we also know that at some point , you’ ll see rents coming down.\n\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow. It looks like stock and\nbond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far. Is that something you wanted\nto see? Is that a problem or what —how that might affect your future policy to see this positive\nreaction?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ re not targeting any one or two particular things. Our message\nshould be —what I ’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think\nwe have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that ’s meant to put that\nquestion, really , as the important one now , going forward.\nI’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in Septe mber —the\nincoming data suggests that that ’s actually going to be higher , and that ’s been the pattern. I\nmean , I would have little confidence that the forecast— if we made a forecast today, if we were\ndoing an SEP today, the pattern has been that , one after another , they go up , and that ’ll end when\nit ends, but there ’s no sense that inflation is coming down. I f you look at the —I have a table of\nthe last 12 months of 12- month readings , and there ’s really no pattern there. We ’re exactly\nwhere we were a year ago. S o I would also say, it ’s premature to discuss pausing. And it ’s not\nsomething that we ’re thinking about . That’s really not a conversation to be had now. We have a\nways to go.\nAnd the last thing I ’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to\ngetting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of\nwithdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon. So those —I control those messages, and\nthat’s my job.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence with F ox Business. T hank you, Fed\nChairman. So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve ’s\ntrying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader\ncontext is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep\nspending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage —to sort of counterbalance each\nother out. It appears, consumer spending is still positive —it’s at pretty m odest growth levels .\nIt’s not shrinking. T he banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that\nthe consumers are still buying and they ’re still— they’re fine . So I don’ t know how big the fiscal\nheadwinds are , and they haven’ t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining\nspending. So it must have to do with the savings that people have.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So, what about the spending? There ’s tens of billions yet to\nbe spent , I mean , from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act,\nbipartisan infrastructure bill. H ow does that play into your thinking about the future?\nCHAIR POWELL. Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also\nfrom the strong demand that ’s still in the labor market. We still see pretty significant demand\nand a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall , I would say it ’s not\nreally t ightening or loosening. So we see those things , and what those things tell us is that our\njob is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We ’re going to have to stick\nwith this. And that ’s just —we take all that as a given , but we know what our objective is , and\nwe know what our tools can do, and that ’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks . We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer from\nMarketplace. I ’m wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think\nit’s possible?\nCHAIR POWELL. Has it narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. W e’ve always said\nit was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for\nlonger , it becomes harder to see the path —it’s narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over\nthe course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of\narray of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to—ordinarily there ’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into\nunemployment , or there ’s Okun’ s law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data,\nand t hey’re very real. Data ’s a little bit different this time , though, because you have this\ntremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve.\nAll I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those\ntraditional measures , because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so\nstrong. Again, that ’s going to be something we discover empirically. I think no one knows\nwhether there’ s going to be a recession or not and, if so, how bad that recession would be. And\nour job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over\ntime. And that ’s what we’ re going to do.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Just real quickly—why do you fee l like the window\nhas narrowed?\nCHAIR POWELL. Because we haven ’t seen inflation coming down. The implication of\ninflation not coming down. W hat we would expect by now to have seen is that as the —really , as\nthe supply -side problems have resolved themselv es, we would have expected goods inflation to\n\ncome down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn ’t. Actually , it has come down , but\nnot to the extent that we had hoped. At the same time, now you see services inflation, core\nservices inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question. That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive , and that narrows the path to a soft landing , I would say.\nThanks very much."
