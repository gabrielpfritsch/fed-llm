  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and\nprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide\nsome relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit\nlasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate. Guided by our new Statement on Longer -Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a f ew weeks ago, these changes clarify\nour strong commitment over a longer time horizon. Before describing today’s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments.\nEconomic activity has picked up from its depressed second- quarter level, wh en much of\nthe economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. With the reopening of many\nbusinesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household\nspending looks to have recovered about three -quarters of its earlier decline. Nonetheless,\nspending on services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality, is still quite weak. The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely\nsupport to household incomes. Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment. The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of\n\nEconomic Projections. Even so, overall activity remains well below its level before the\npandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.\nIn the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April\nhave been regained as many people returned to work. The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August. Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the med ian\nprojection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great\nuncertainty about the future.\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. For some goods, including\nfood, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income. More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer -run objective. The median inflation projection from\nFOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.\nAs the economy began its recovery, COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also\nrose. The reimposition of some social -distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior\nby many individuals have succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus. As we have emphasized\n\nthroughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will\ndepend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check. All of us have a role to pl ay in\nour nation’s response to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.\nThe path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the\ngovernment to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed. The Fede ral\nReserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.\nThe changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual -\nmandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer -Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy. We view maximum employment as a broad -based and\ninclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unle ss\naccompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals. And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer -term inflation exp ectations remain well anchored at\nour longer -run 2 percent objective. In turn, well -anchored inflation expectations enhance our\nability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times.\n\nHence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent,\nwe “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation\naverages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at\n2 percent. ” We expect “ to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these\noutcomes ”—including maximum employment —“are achieved. ” With regard to interest rates,\nwe now in dicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent\ntarget range for the federal funds rate “ until labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation h as risen to\n2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. ”\nIn addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “ holdings of Treasury\nsecurities and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace. ” The se asset\npurchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative\nfinancial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.”\nWe believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will serve the economy\nwell by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take. Of course,\nas we note in our policy statement, we “ would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary\npolicy as appropriate if risks emerge that could im pede the attainment of our [the Committee’s]\ngoals.”\nThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly\nsupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local gove rnments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage\nto the economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in\n\nvery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as a\nbackstop to key credit markets and appear to have restored the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,\nenabled , in large part , by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. When\nthe time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.\nAs I have emphasized befo re, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed\ncannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will\nbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials hav e the power to tax and spend and\nto make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The\nfiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,\nbusinesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the\ncountry. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\n\nFinally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of our friend and\ncolleague, Thomas Laubach. His outstanding analysis and advice have been indispensable to the\nFOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal\nReserve. He will be remembered for his intellect, but also his kindness, his equanimity, and his dedication to achieving our mission on behalf of the American people. We will miss him. Thank you. I ’ll now be glad to take your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timiraos .\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Good afternoon , Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street\nJournal . Yo u’ve been very clear about the C ommittee ’s intention on rates, not even thinking\nabout thinking about raising rates , and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls to 4\npercent and inflation rises to 2 percent . My question is about asset purcha ses. Does the\nguidance today apply t o the current asset purchase pace ? Are there any macroeconomic\nconditions under which you would favor increasing the monthly pace of Treasury and MB S\npurchases? And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthl y pace of purchases be\nappropriate? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So we say in our postmeeting statement that we’ ll\ncontinue to increase our securities holdings “ at least at the current pace” over coming months “ to\nsustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.” That\nlatter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I ’ve been saying in these press\nconferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases ar e fostering accommodative financial conditions as well. That amounts to roughly\n$80 billion a month of T reasuries and $40 billion net per month for MB S.\n\nSo we do —we do think that these purchases have been effective in , in restoring orderly\nmarket conditions and have supported the flow of credit to households and businesses, including\nby fostering more accommodative financial conditions , which , of course , we think is a good\nthing. So , in terms of going forward, I would just say this : There are various ways an d margins\nthat we can adjust our tools going forward, and we ’ll continue to monitor developments. And\nwe’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could—if I could follow up, I suppose the question I have is,\nwhy give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we think our —we think our policy stance is appropriate\ntoday, and we ’re prepar ed to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate. And today we\nbelieve that particularly this very strong forward guidance —very powerful forward guidance that\nwe’ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy. Effectively , we’re saying\nthat rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity.\nNow we ’re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the —across the Treasury\ncurve. That ’s also adding to accommodation. We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and,\nand the rate tool and, and other tools as well. But as for right now, we think—we think that our\npolicy setting is appropriate to support the ex pansion. We did—we said from the beginning that\nwe would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, a nd then we would support the expansion when it came. Well, it ’s here. And\nit’s well a long. And so that ’s why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the\nflexibility to do more when we think it ’s appropriate.\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for t aking my question. Jeanna\nSmiale k, New York Times. I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability\nin the long- run statement that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month. I ’m\nwondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases. You know, would financial stability concerns\non their own be enough to merit changes in the f ed funds rate? Or would they have to come in\nconjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate? If you could, sort of , give us an outline of your thinking there, please.\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we said in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and\nMonetar y Policy Strategy was that the C ommittee ’s policy decisions reflect “ its longer -run goals,\nits medium -term outlook, and its assessment [s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the\nfinancial system that coul d impede the at tainment of the C ommittee ’s goals.” So that ’s what we\nsaid about financial stability. And today we said that we ’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of\nmonetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the\nCommittee’s ] goals.”\nBut you asked specifically about , about financial stability. One thing I would say is that\nfinancial —that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense —is not the first line of\ndefense on financial stability. We look to more appropria te tools in the first instance as a first\nline of defense , and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity , stress\ntesting —all of those things, macroprudential tools. All of those things are, are really the first\nline of defense o n financial stability. But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore\n\nthose kinds of risks and other kinds of risks , more broadly, that could impede the attainment of\nour goals in, in setting monetary policy. So that’s , that’s really how we think about it , but\nprincipally that, you know, other tools are the —are the frontline , as I mentioned.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren ’t forthcoming,\nwould financial stability concerns in and of themselves be enough to warrant a rate hike?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , you know, what we said again in the [Statement on] L onger -Run\n[Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy] —you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you\nknow —“policy decisions reflect … the balance of ri sks, including risks to the financial system\nthat coul d impede the attainment of the C ommittee ’s goals.” So the test would be, you know,\ndoes a majority of the C ommittee feel that , that monetary policy is , is triggering that? And that ,\nthat would be —that would be the test. And , you know, it ’s not something that we ’ve done. We\ndo monitor financial stability concerns , of course , intensely and regularly. We try to use our\nother tools on them, but we , we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman .\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me unde rstand how the\nprojections of the C ommittee line up with the goals of the C ommittee. You’ve now altered the\nprojections to—the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent . But when I look at the SEP, I\ndon’t see the C ommittee believing a single year in the next four years that you are ever above\n2 percent . In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you\nactually hit 2 percent . So do you think—are, are you confident —is this just the C ommittee is not\nconfident that not only can it not hit its 2 percent goal, but that now it can ’t hit its goal of being\nabove 2 percent ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Not at all. And, you know, you don’t —you also don ’t see people , by\nand large , lifting off or raising interest rates above zero. I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a\nCommittee o f 17 during that —during the forecast period . So we don’ t reach 2 percent , but we\nget very close to it in the forecast. We reach 2 percent —I guess the median is 2 percent at the\nend of 2023. So , you know, you know what the guidance says. It says that we expect that the\ncurrent setting of , of our r ates will be—what we expect [is] that it will be appropriate until such\ntime as we reach 2 percent inflation , that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with\nour assessment of maximum employment, and that we ’re on track to achieve inflation\nmoderate —inflation moderately above. So that ’s the test. So I don’ t think there ’s any conflict\nbetween those two because, you know, the , the way they’re set up, the projections don’ t show the\nout years.\nYou asked about confidence, and I would say that thi s, this very strong, very powerful\nguidance shows both our confidence and our determination. It shows our confidence that we can\nreach this goal and our determination to do so.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I ’m sorry, if I could just follow up without being simplistic about\nthis. But why wouldn’t —if the C ommittee was confident that it could reach its new goal of\naiming for inflation above 2 percent , why wouldn’ t one of those years at least show inflation\nbeing above 2 percent on the median forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. Because it —we think, looking at everything we know about inflation\ndynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take\nsome time. We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow\nas, as people go back to work. And we ’ll still have an area of the economy —a big area of the\neconomy—that struggles. There will be slack in the economy. The economy will be below\n\nmaximum employment, below full demand. And that will tend to wear —to put downward\npressure on inflation. So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think\nthat inflation will come back , generally. And , I mean, that ’s sort of what happened during the\nlast long expansion. It ’s a slow process, but —but there is a process there. Inflation does move\nup over time. We do expect that will continue today, a nd we expect that our , our guidance is\npowerful and will help that outcome. We think that —that effectively saying that policy will\nremain highly accommodative unt il the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide\nstrong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel .\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. I\nwanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another\nstimulus package and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy\nthat you think could be helped by more aid from Congress. Thanks very much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sur e. So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic P rojections\nthat my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you’ ll see is an expectation that the recovery\nwill continue —that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, ’ 22, and ’ 23. We do\nexpect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace w ould be fastest\nright at the beginning of the —right at the beginning of the recovery, because you had such a\nsharp decline. You would expect that the third quarter should be the fastest gains, and that , after\nthat, the pace should slow down to a more norm al pace. So we do expect that.\nIn terms of fiscal policy —you asked about fiscal policy. So , you know, one thing— I\nguess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid. It was\n\nforceful and pretty effective. And we ’re seeing the results of that in —today in income and\nhousehold spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for\nbusiness equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and , you\nknow, the pace of de fault and things like that has really slowed. So there ’s been a really\npositive effect.\nThat said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed. Of course, the\ndetails of that are for Congress, not for the F ed. But I would just say, there are still roughly\n11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were\nworking in industries that are likely to struggle. Those people may need additional , additional\nsupport as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them. We’ve also\ngot struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public. And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time\nspending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects. So , again, I\nwould say, the fiscal support has been essential in , in the good progress we see now.\nAnd, finally, I’ ll note that just about all— the overwhelming majority of , of private\nforecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial\nadditional fiscal support.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Mike Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. [Inaudible] t aking my question. Should we e xpect any further\nevolutions in forward guidance, say , maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans r ule that\nwe had a few years ago? Or is there something else that the F ed might be considering in the\nfuture?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, s o we think that the forward guidance we adopted today is\nappropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful. Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will keep\npolicy where it is now —keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the\nCommittee ’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment , labor market conditions\nreach levels that are consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment ,\nuntil inflation reaches 2 percent , and until it ’s on track to go above 2 percent moderately for\nsome time. So that ’s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable\nguidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years. So that ’s, that’s\nreally our thinking on, on forward guidance on rate s.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this. So to follow\nup on Mike ’s question there , since you described this guidance as durable, you—you’ve set up a\nthree -part test here for rate h ikes: levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment,\ninflation has risen to 2 percent, and you’ re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some\ntime. Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more.\nHow do we pin down assessments of maximum employment? When you say that “ inflation has\nrisen to 2 percent ,” does that mean 2 percent for a day, a month, six months? And when you say\n“on track to moderately exceed,” how should we define “ moderately ”? And how should we\ndefine “ for some time ”?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, maximum employment is not —is not something\nthat can be reduced to a number the way inflation can. It’s a broad range of factors. It really always has been and , really , a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look\nat. So it’s broader labor conditions , consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum\n\nemployment. So that would certainly mean low unemployment , it would mean high labor force\nparticipation , it would mean wages —it would be a whole range of things . And we ’re not looking\nat a rule. We ’re looking at a judgmental assessment , which I think we ’ll be very transparent\nabout as we —as we go forward.\nIn terms of inflation, you know, this is a C ommittee that is both confident and committed\nto—and determined to reach our goals. And the idea that we would look for the , the quickest\nway out is just —it’s just not who we are. It’s not that—t here’s no message of that here. We\nwould not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation ; we said return to 2—to achieve\n2 percent inflation. Okay . So just understand that, you know, we ’re strongly committed to\nachieving our goals and the overshoot. So that should tell you about that.\nOh, in terms of —okay, in terms of —so, what does “ moderate ” mean? It means not large.\nIt doesn’t —it means not very high above 2 percent . It means moderate. I think that’ s a fairly\nwell-understood word. In terms of —in terms of “for a time, ” what it means is not permanently\nand not for a sustained period. You know, we ’re, we’re resisting the urge to try to create some\nsort of a rule or a formula here. And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we\nwant. It’ s actually prett y straightforward. We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent\nover time. And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that ’ll help us\nachieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its\nability to support the economy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi .\nJAMES POLITI. Thanks for taking the question. James Politi with the Financial Times .\nDo you consider today’ s enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the —to\nthe U.S. economy from a monetary perspective and sort of deliver further support for the\n\neconomy? Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance? And , in terms of fiscal support,\ndo you assume in your own projections —not just , you know, private forecasters—that additional\nfiscal support will be forthcoming? Or do you expect weaker growth or a —or a larger\ncontraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , in terms of the effects, so I think what we’ve done is—is more or\nless aligned with the consensus statement today. So it ’s, it’s in line with what , what might have\nbeen expected. As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this\neconomy as we move forward. In a sense, it ’s consistent with expectations, so I don ’t—I’m not\nlooking for a big reaction right now. But I think , over time, again, guidance that we expect to\nretain the current stance until the economy is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong\nand powerful t hing. And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.\nIn terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if —\nyes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made\ndifferent assessments on their own. I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among\nprivate forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.\nAnd there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something. The question is, how much and when?\nAnd so I would just say that if —and it ’s very hard to say. So , so far the economy has\nproven resilient to the —to the lapsing of the —to the, of the CARES Act unemployment —\nenhanced unemployment benefits. But there ’s, there’s certainly a risk , though, that , that those\nwho are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, a nd they ’ll,\nthey’ll now spend them , and that , as the months pass, if , if there ’s no follow -up on that, if there\nisn’t additional support and there isn ’t a job for the —some of those people who are, are from\n\nindustries where , where it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll —that will start\nto show up in economic activity. It’ll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and,\nand, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy. So that ’s a downside risk.\nSo I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the —what will\nbe the contents ? And , you know, no one —no one has any certainty around that, but , broadly\nspeaking, if we don’ t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the —\ncertainly through the channel I mentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Thanks for taking my question. Chair man Powell, given the recent\nupdate to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens events, is the F ed\nopen to other measures of the economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we —you know, we monitor everything we think is important in\nthe U.S. economy. And in that —in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary\npolicy. You mentioned inequality. So , you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well -\nbeing by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully.\nInequality, which I would point to— it’s a multifaceted thing. But I would point to the relative\nstagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility. So those are things that hold back our economy. They are.\nThe thing is, we don’ t really have the tools to address those. We, we have interest rates\nand bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that , but we can’t —we can’t\nget at those things through our tools. When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the\neconomy across a broad range of , of people and activities, but we can’t —we don’ t have the\nability to target particular groups.\n\nNotwithstanding that, we , we do talk about it , because these are important features of our\neconomy. And we —you know, I , I think those are—those distributional issue s are, are issues\nthat are really for our elected officials. And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back\nour economy. The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and , and the health care and all the things that you\nneed to be an active participant in our workforce. So I think we can—if we want to have the , the\nhighest potential output and the —and the best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to\nbe very broadly spread in the longer run.\nAnd I—again, I would just say, the F ed—you know, we can talk about those things a lot.\nAnd in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual\ngroups. So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans when —you\nknow, we would look at that as we think about whether we ’re really at maximum employment.\nWe would look—we would look at that along with a lot of other data. So the answer is, we do\nlook at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools. But , ultimately, these are issues\nfor elected representatives.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Ye s, thank you, Chairma n Powell, for the question. I just\nwanted some clarity here. At what point do you think it’ s prudent to shift the bond purchases\nfrom market stability —as you had said, from the shorter -term maturities to more longer- term,\nmore stimulus -related?\nCHAIR POW ELL. So , you know, we think our —we think that our asset purchases are\ndoing both the thing—both those things today. We think, clearly , there ’s been great progress , in\nterms of market function. If you remember , early in the spring when the acute phase of the\n\npandemic hit, market function was very low. And it ’s improved rapidly and, and in many\nrespects is , is in a good place now. We also , though, think that these asset purchases, which total\n$120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example , the last asset purchase\nprogram during the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the recovery therefrom —we think that that ’s also\nproviding accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth. And we think that ’s fine.\nWe’re also aware that we, we —there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do\nvarious things —you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of\nthe—of the curve. And , you know, we ’re, we’re going to continue to monitor developments, and\nwe’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria. Vi ctoria Guida .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about a couple\nof things. First of all, if we don ’t get a vaccine until well into next year, what does that mean for\nthe economy? And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more\ndetail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether\nthat is going to be another full -blown stress test, whether we ’re going to publicly see those\nresults, and what it might mean for bank payouts.\nCHAIR POWELL. Great. So, on the first one , what’s happening is basically we ’re\nlearning to live with —right now , we're learning to live with COVID , which st ill spreads. And\nwe’re learning to , to engage in economic activity. All of this recovery that we ’ve seen is in a\ncontext where —you know, where people are still at risk of , of catching it , and yet we ’re able to\nresume lots and lots of economic activities. And that involves, as I mentioned, you know —I\nthink the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce —wearing\nmasks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ ll be able to get economic activity\n\nback up close to whe re it was. I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just\ngoing to really struggle until we have an —a vaccine that ’s, that’s in wide —you know, wide\nusage and is , is widely trusted. And those are the ones where people were getting really\nclosely —close together.\nI also think testing —to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with\nthat in the workforce. You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have\nregular —very regular testing that doesn’ t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.\nIf you do that, you’ ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall\ncase numbers are quite low. And that will help a lot.\nSo I think we ’re, we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards —you\nknow, as far as we can. There ’s always going to be that —for, for some time, there’ s going to be\ncertain activities that will be —that will be hard to, to resume. So I , I think that ’s the only way I\ncan say it . And I think trying to—you know, we all —when we make a forecast, we make\nassessments about that , but it’s really hard to say. There is no template here. There ’s no—you\nknow, there’s no experience with this.\nSo, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’ s recovered faster than expected.\nAnd that may continue or not. We just don’ t know. And I think we should do those things that\nwe control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible. And the main thing, again, is\nwearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’ re in the workforce. That ’s something we\ncan all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks , and\nthings like that.\n\nIn, in terms of the str ess test s, so I really don ’t have any—you know, we ’re getting ready\nquite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly. There ’s not much I can say\nwith you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s —on that today. I don’ t have anything for you.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Chris Condon .\nCHRIS TOPHER CONDON. Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, Chair man Powell.\nYou have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend,\nand sometimes the latter is what ’s really needed. But to the extent that a $600 billion lending\nprogram for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending P rogram , which has purchase d just , I think , $1.4 billion in\nloans so far?\nEric Rosengren at the Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how\nmuch risk it wants the program to take. But Congress has already appropriat ed substantial funds\nfor the 13( 3) programs , and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses.\nMeanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they ’re being told by commercial\nbanks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses —zero losses in Main\nStreet P rogram loans. So , if I may, why is it that th e Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the\nTreasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should be applied to the Main Street\nLending P rogram in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So , a couple things about Main Street. It , it reaches the whole\nnation. It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are\npart of it, a nd it’s making loans. The number is more like —it’s close to $2 billion now. So the\nnumbers are going up. Banks are joining; borrowers are coming. And it ’s significant. It’s , it’s\n\nrelatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be —\nshould that be appropriate. You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally\nfind that , that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem. And that , that is a lot of\nPPP, bank credit lines , and syndicated loans. There ’s a lot of credit being let out the re.\nSo—but you’ re right. We , we are looking at some things. We ’re looking at —some\nlenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations. So banks are going to—their\napproach is likely to be that they ’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they\nunderwrite any loan. They ’re keeping part of it, and, you know, what , what we want to do is\nmake sure that —that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in ,\nin place, and also that —you know, it ’s, it’s really —it’s re ally a, a facility for , for companies or\nborrowers that, that don’ t have access to , to “ regular way ” borrowing now. Otherwise, why\nwould we need Main Street?\nSo that ’s what we're working on. And we ’ll be doing some , some —we ’ll be making\nsome changes in that respect. I don’t —I saw what President Rosengren said. I, I can’t really\ncomment directly on that. I just woul d say that, you know, this is 13( 3). If you look at the law\nunder section 13(3), it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers. And ,\nand the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of , of section 13(3) in effect,\nincluding the requirement that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent.\nThis was —this la w was amended in, you know , under —in Dodd- Frank, and the idea was, was to\nmake it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans —at the time, the thinking\nwas to banks.\nSo now we —now we ’re using that same law for , for smaller business borrowers, and ,\nyou know, it doesn’t— it’s not a perfect fit. And , and, I would also just say , for many borrowers,\n\nthey’ re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down , and they won’ t be able to\nservice a loan, and so they may need more fiscal support. Having said that, we’re , we’re\ncontinuing to work to , to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available —make it pretty\nmuch to any company that needs it and that can service a loan.\nCHRIS TOPHER CONDON. And can you just very briefly address the reports that the\nTreasury is advising banks to target zero losses? Is that appropriate?\nCHAIR POWELL. I can ’t say. I don’t —I don’t know about that. I haven’ t heard those\nreports. You know, again, if you think about it , we, we weren ’t—we’re , we’re going to have to\ngo through the banking system to do this. We —we ’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a\nmillion loan off icers working for the F ed and the Treasury. So we ’re going to go through the\nbanking system , and the banks —banks like to make good loans. That ’s what they do. They ’re\ntrained to make good loans. So you should expect that they— and we expect that they will do\nsome underwriting. We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the poi nt\nof it. And the question is, how do you dial that in? It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do. And , you\nknow, we ’re getting some loans made , and we ’re hopeful that we ’ll, that we’ll clarify this a nd\nthat credit will continue to flow.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber .\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, you’ ve\ntalked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we ’ve seen so\nfar. Presumably you’ re referring to airlines, hotels, ot her sections—you know, parts of the\neconomy that rely on close contact. How are you thinking about that , in terms of its overall\nimpact? Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above —you know, far above\nyour maximum goals? Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine? Or are a lot of\n\nthose folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new indust ries? And should we expect\nthe F ed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, we —of course, we can’t be—we can’t be really sure we know\nthe answers to those questions. But I would say, th e, the likely path is that the —that the\nexpansion will continue. And it’s , as I said, it’s well along, and it’ll move most easily through\nthe parts o f the economy —it’ll still take some time , but the parts of the economy that weren’t\nexactly directly affected , that didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them,\nto fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that —those are going to\nbe the places that are —that are very challenging. So there will also be the—you know, the\nplaces that are affected that way. And that ’s going to be challenging for , for some time. It just\nis. And we don’ t really know how long that will be.\nIt’s—you know, it ’s millions of people. As I mentioned, we had 11 million—something\nlike 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who\nwent —who lost their jobs in March and April. So that ’s half of the m. So, 11 million —\nparticularly if the pace of , of returning to work slows down, it ’s going to leave a large —a large\ngroup of people. And it ’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint. And our\ncommitment is not to forget those people. As I mentioned, we want —you know, the sense of our\nforward guidance is that policy will remain , as we’ ve said , highly accommodative until the —\nuntil the expansion is well along—really , very close to our goals. And even after , if we do lift\noff, we will keep pol icy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation\nfor some time. So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will support the full\nrecovery, including those people , as long as it takes.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Mike McKee.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chair man, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and\nTelevision. Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very\nlong time into the recovery, lower -for-longer as far out as three years in your latest projections , is\nthat basically it for the F ed? In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things\nyou can do would push down on interest rates. But is it really —is it the case now that the only\nadditional stimulus that can come to the e conomy is from the fiscal side?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, no, I wouldn’t —I certainly would not say that we ’re out of\nammo . Not at all. So, first of all, we , we do have lots of tools. We’ve got the lending tools ,\nwe’ve got the balance sheet, and we’ ve got further forward guidance —further forward guidance.\nSo we, we —there ’s still plenty more that we can do. We do think that our —that our, our rate\npolicy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy. We think it ’s powerful. And , as I\nmentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over\ntime, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well\nalong—really , very close to our goals —and then will remain accommodative even aft er we lift\noff. So I think that’s , that’s a really strong place for , for rate policy to be. But, again, we have\nthe other margins that we can still use. So , no. C ertainly , we’re not out of ammo.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up, in terms of t he balance sheet, are you\nconcerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods -and-\nservices inflation? In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very\ncarefully. These are—these are not new questions. These were questions that were very much in\nthe air a decade ago and more when , when the F ed first started doing QE. And , I would say, if\nyou look at the long experience of, you know, the 10- year, 8 -month expansion, the longest in our\n\nrecorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years. And , I\nwould say, it was notable for the lack of the emergenc e of, of some sort of a financial bubble —a\nhousing bubble or some kind of a bubble , the popping of which could threaten the expansion.\nThat didn’ t happen. And , frankly, it hasn’ t really happened around the world since then. That\ndoesn’ t mean that it won ’t happen, but —and so, of course , it’s something that we monitor\ncarefully.\nAfter the financial crisis, we started a new —a whole division of the F ed to focus on\nfinancial stability. We look at it in every—from every perspective. The F OMC gets briefed on a\nquarterly basis. At the B oard here , we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis , so it is\nsomething we monitor. But I don’ t know that the —that the connection between asset purchases\nand, and financial stability is a particularly tight one. So—but again, we won’t be —we won ’t be\njust assuming that. We ’ll be checking carefully as we go. And , by the way, the kinds of tools\nthat we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy. It would be\nmore tools that strengthen the financial system.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee.\nDON LEE . Chair Powell, I ’d like to ask you about the labor market. As you know, in\nAugust there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits. Yet the BLS jobs report for August showed about 13½ million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before\nthe pandemic. I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , I mean, I think the overall picture —take a step back from t his.\nThe overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it ’s a\nlong way—a long way from maximum employment. I think that’s , that’s the bottom line on it.\n\nSo, within that , though —take claims in particular. The number of claims, the quantity of claims ,\nand, frankly, the fact that PUA claims are new —the P andemic U nemployment A ssistance\nclaims—that ’s a new system that had to be set up. The actual counting of the claims is , is\nvolatile , and , and it ’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level. So , you know,\nbecause people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them\nall at once and things like that.\nI think , though, what you’ ve seen is that the l evel of —certainly the level of initial claims\nhas declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level —continues either to be flat or gradually decline. It’s worth noting— and that ’s good—it’ s\nworth noting that tha t level is maybe five times the level of what claims were . Claims were\naround 200,000; n ow they’ re 900,000, in that range , weekly for , for initial claims. So that just\ntells you, the labor market has improved, but it ’s a long, long way from maximum employment ,\nand it will be some time getting back there. I think that ’s the best way to think about it. In many\nparts of the economy there ’s just a lot of disruption, and it’s , it’s really hard to say precisely\nwhere we are.\nI’ll give you another example with— you know, we say unemployment ’s 8.4 percent. B ut\nif you count those who are —who are misidentified as, as employed when they’ re actually\nunemployed and you add back some part of the participation number —so if you were —if you\nhad a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force. But I—you know, I would—I\nwould more look at those people as unemployed. If you add those back, the level of\nunemployment ’s pro bably 3 percent higher. On the other hand, by that metric, the , the\n\nunemployment rate would have been in the —in the 20s in , in April. So the improvement has\nbeen quite substantial under any measurement. But the level is still quite high.\nDON LEE. Well, if I could follow up, i s—is it the F ed’s aim to get back to 3.5 percent\nor even lower?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, absolutely. You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular\nnumber, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3 ½ percent unemployment. It’ s not a\nmagic number. No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum\nemployment. I would just say , you asked about 3 ½ percent . A 3½ percent unemployment rate\nshowed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the i ncome spectrum —in fact, going\nmore to people at the bottom end of the spectrum. It showed labor force participation coming up\nas—up above many estimates of its trend , as people who ’d been out of the labor force were\nbeing pulled into a tight job market. There ’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market,\nparticularly in a world where we didn ’t see inflation. So, yes, we ’d love to get back to that.\nI mean, I would say, we would like to get back— rather than to a particular number, we ’d\nlike to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find\nwork, where labor force participation is holding up nicely. That ’s what we ’d really love to get\nback to. Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with , with our\nframework. But the good news is , we think we can have quite low unemployment without\nraising troubling inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall -Genzer .\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I want to follow up on the wealth gap issue. I know you were —that you have limited\n\ntools. But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand\nyour research on racial economic gaps?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we do—we are gifted with a , a subst antial group of\nresearchers who really cover the waterfront. And we do a significant amount of research on\nracial disparities in —across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked about. So we do\nthat. And we also —remember , we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs ,\nwhich is present in communities around the country. And the R eserve B anks all have very active\ncommunity a ffairs groups. They ’re present in communities around the country. So it wasn ’t just\nthe Fed —Fed Listens events. It’s more , just , over a long period of time we, we are in contact\nwith people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy.\nWe serve all Americans, and we know that. And we ’re going to use our tools to , to\nreflect that fact. So the answer is “ yes.” We do quite a bit of research , and I suppose we could\ndo more, but we really do a lot. And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of , of\nthe state of the economy. And we do that not just becaus e it’s interesting and important, but\nbecause it ’s important for the economy and important for our mandate.\nWe are assigned “ maximum employment.” Now, what does that mean? As I mentioned\nearlier, it doesn ’t mean a particular headline unemployment number. What it means is maximum\nemployment. So , you know, we look at —look at that in many, many different variables, and we\nask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute max imum employment. And that would include all of the\nthings that we ’re talking about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Greg Robb.\n\nGREG ROBB. Hi, Greg Rob b from MarketWatch. Thanks for this. I want to go back to\nthe new forward guidance that you have. And you said that it ’s powerful, but you’ve already\nhave two dissent —two dissenting voters on it. And I was wondering if there ’s other , other\npeople who argued against it. And what do you say to the two who dissented? It look s like\nPresident Kashkari wanted a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the\ncurrent guidance you have was fine for now. So , like , how did you argue back on those , on those\narguments? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t—I don ’t want to comment particularly on, on the two\ndissenters, b ut they, they consent —they dissented from , of course , different perspectives, and,\nand that should be clear. That’s their —they’re not—they ’re sort of on, on two sides of the , of\nthe discussion. But I would say this : I am blessed wi th having a C ommittee of highly thoughtful\npeople who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and , of course , diverse views to\nour work. And I wouldn’ t have it any other way. I wouldn’ t. So, so I would just say, the\nright —in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the\nCommi ttee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy and what ’s in there —very, very broad support , unanimous support for that. Ever yone\nsees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees , in their own way, the need to address\nthose —and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that\nwe’re now at flexible average inflation targeting.\nOf course, there would be —this is —you know, we ’re the first major central bank to\nadopt this framework. There ’s no cookbook, and we —you know, this is the first guidance under\nour new framework. So , of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect\nthat. And it ’s actually a healthy thing. So I welcome that discussion. I would also say this : You\n\nknow, this is all about credibility , and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility.\nThis, this facility —this , this framework has to —we hav e to support it with our actions. And I\nthink today is a very good first step in doing that.\nIt is strong, powerful guidance. It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on ]\nLonger -Run Goals and Monetary Policy S trategy. We had quite a robust discussion, and there\nare, there are different ideas on how to do this , but I—that ’s just , that’s just the way it is when\nyou have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people. And so I ’m pleased with\nwhere it came out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted\nto ask about commercial real estate. I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren’t sure if\nthere was a way the Fed could support CRE borrowers. But I was just wondering if you had—if\nyou’ve had any other continuing discussions on that and if there’s any potential way that the F ed\ncould step in in that area.\nCHAIR POWELL. So thank you for that question. You know, we ’ve actually spent\nquite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think , mentioned the other day. And I ’ll say\njust a couple things. First, you know, our facilities are essentially always —they have to be ,\nunder the law —broad based and not so much targeting any single sector. Also, it’ s important to\nremember that CRE , commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities. So\nthe TALF takes commercial mortgage- backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.\nAnd the New York F ed purchases agency CMBSs direc tly. In addition, I would say, Main Street\nhelps businesses pay their rent, you know. So we ’re, we’re helping real estate, you know, in a\nnumber of other ways —commercial real estate.\n\nAlso, CMBS issuance has resumed. Spreads have tightened on CMBS. Ther e are a\ncouple of issues. One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have\ncovenants —uniformly, I think , have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt. So you\nhave a situation, and you have a situation where , where you—without a l egal change or some\nkind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you’re —you have a hard time providing mass\nrelief with regard to real estate that’ s in, in commercial mortgage- backed securities. So we ’re\nstill working on it. We ’re still looking. I would say, it may be that further support for\ncommercial real estate will require further action for Congress —from Congress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. For the last question, we ’ll go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. So it seems like a lot of the new inflation\nframework is about shaping inflation expectations. But the average American who might be\nwatching this m ight be confused as to why the F ed is overshooting inflation. So what ’s your\nexplanation to Main Stre et, to average people what the F ed is trying to do here and what the\noutcome would be for those on Main Street ? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s a very , very important question, and I actually spoke about\nthat in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago. It’ s not intuitive to people. It is intuitive\nthat, that high inflation is a bad thing. It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low. And the\nway I would explain it is , is that inflation that’ s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.\nThere ’s an expectation of future i nflation that’ s built into every interest rate, right? And to the\nextent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower. And then the\nFed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy. And this isn ’t some idle, you know,\nacademic theory. This is what ’s happening all over the world. If you, if you look at many, many\nlarge jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon.\n\nSo we want inflation to be —we want it to be 2 percent , and we want it to average\n2 percent . So if inflation averages 2 percent , the public will expect that , and that ’ll be what ’s\nbuilt into interest rates. And that ’s just—that’s all we want. So we ’re not looking to have high\ninflation. We just want inflation to average 2 percent . And that means that , you know, in a\ndownturn, these days , what happens is , inflation, as has happened now —it moves down well\nbelow 2 percent . And that means that we ’ve said for , for—we would like to see and we will\nconduct policies so that inflation moves , for some time , moderately above 2 percent . So it won’t\nbe—these won ’t be large overshoots , and they won’ t be permanent but to help anchor inflation\nexpectations at 2 percent . So, yes, it ’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people . But,\nnonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large. And , you know, those are the people\nwe’re serving , and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent\ninflation , we believe. And that ’s why we changed our framework.\nMICHEL LE SMITH. Thank you very much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."
