  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nWe understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn ’t work for anyone. In particular,\nwithout price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early l ast year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and\nwe are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We ’ve covered a lot of\nground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt . Looking ahead, we will\ncontinue to take a data -dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming\nthat may be appropriate. I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a mode rate pace.\nGrowth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year. Although a ctivity\nin the housing se ctor has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely\nreflecting higher mortgage rates. And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, job gains averaged\n244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent. There are some continuing s igns that supply and\n\ndemand in the labor market are coming into better balance. T he labor force participation rate has\nmoved up since last year , particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth\nhas shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the\njobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of\navailable workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in M ay, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4. 6 percent. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer\nprice index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.\nInflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, the process\nof getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation,\nlonger- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial\nmarkets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the A merican people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant —significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,\nespecially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and\ntransportatio n. We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our\nmandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 ¼ to 5½ percent. W e are also continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today’s action, we ’ve raised our\n\npolicy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year . We have been seeing the effects of our\npolicy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,\nparticularly housing and investment. It will take time, howeve r, for the full effects of our\nongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, t he economy is\nfacing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely\nto weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.\nIn determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,\nand economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by\nmeeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for\neconomic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks.\nWe remain committed to bring ing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping\nlonger -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period\nof below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. S teve.\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you. You have, I think a couple of times in\nyour opening remarks , talked about this language “ in determining the extent of additional policy\nfirming that may be appropriate. ” Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on\nthe way? And should we also believe that all future meetings —say , September and November —\nare live, or are you in a n every -other -meeting mode? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’ t made a d ecision to go to every other meeting. It ’s not\nsomething we ’ve looked at. We ’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into\neach meeting, we’ re going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven’ t made any\ndecisions about , about any future meetings, including the pace at which we ’d consider hiking.\nBut we ’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate —you\nread the language—“ to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”\nI would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations :\nEconomic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the\nJune CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI\nreport, of course , was welcomed , but it ’s only one report, one month’ s data. We hope that\ninflation will follow a lower path , as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we\ndon’t know that , and we ’re just going to need to see more data.\nSo, what are we going to be looking at? Really , it will be the broader, the whole broader\npicture, and starting with —we ’re looking for moderate growth, right? We ’re looking for supply\nand demand through the economy coming into better balance , including, in parti cular , in the\nlabor market. We’ ll be looking at inflation. W e’ll be asking ourselves , does this whole\ncollection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that ’s how we ’re thinking about\n\nthe next meeting and, you know, how we ’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,\nbut, you know, we ’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.\nI will also say, since we ’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we\nget two more job reports, two more CPI reports . I think we have an ECI report coming later this\nweek —which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.\nAll of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it\nis certainly possible t hat we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant\nit, and I would also say it ’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We’ re\ngoing to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I ’ll close by saying\nwe’ve raised the f ederal funds r ate now by 525 basis points since March 2022 . Monetary policy,\nwe believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there : You\nsaid the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations. Does that\nmean there ’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that\ntwo more hikes are necessary?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m just going to go back to what I said. We, we —you know, that ’s\nthe question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting , and all that data that I\nrecited, we’ re going to be looking at all that and making that assessm ent then. And it really —we\ndid have the one good reading, and, of course , we welcome that . But it’s just one reading, as\neverybody knows . And, and, you know, we ’ve seen —we ’ve seen this before in the data. Many\nforecasts call for, for rates —for , for inflation to remain low, but we just don’ t know that until we\nsee the data. So we ’ll be focusing on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\n\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.\nObviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today. Y ou know, we ’ve\nseen the Barbie movie numbers . We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this\nsummer. It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does see m like\ngrowth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well. And I wonder , from your\nperspective , if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,\nperforming well this summer, is that a problem because it’ s inflationary , or is it good news\nbecause it suggests that a soft landing is more likely? Just how are you thinking about that sort\nof trajectory?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the\neconomy, the fact that , that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any\nmeaningful negative impact o n the labor market, the strength of the economy —overall, that’ s a\ngood thing. It’s good to see that, of course. It ’s also —you see consumer , consumer confidence\ncoming up and things like that . That will support activity going forward. But you’ re, you’re\nright , though. A t the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that\nwould require an appropriate response for monetary policy. So we ’ll be watching that carefully\nand seeing how it evolves over time.\nMICHELE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. So , as you referenced\nearlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look\ngood. So if you’ re data dependent, why not pause again? Why not stay on hold? Why not take\nanother meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the directio n you want to see?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you go back to what we ’re trying to do here, we ’re trying to\nachieve a stance of policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent. At\nthe last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimat es of that would take —of what that would\ntake, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes. So I would sa y, we looked at\nthe interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,\nbut broadly consiste nt with expectations . And, as a result, we went ahead and , and took another\nstep. And that ’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but , but gradually\nslowing. I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but , you\nknow, we ’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from , from a single reading.\nAnd, you know, growth came in stronger than expected. So that ’s how we look at it, and, and so\nwe did take that step today.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, markets\nwidely believe the median FOMC participant ’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter\nof this year will be too high , given autos and shelter , and t hat by S eptember , that may warrant a\ndownward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points. Would that type of inflation\nprogress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below -trend growth and\ndecelerating labor income growt h to be convinced that you ’ve done enough?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of\nthis and how much of that . You know, we ’ll be looking at everything. And , you know, we ’ll, of\ncourse , we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’ s CPI is replicated or , or the\nopposite of replicated or whether it’ s somewhere in the middle. We’ ll be looking at the growth\ndata. We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall\n\njudgment about that. It ’s the totality of the data, I think , but with a particular focus on, on\nmaking progress on inflation.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up : Last month you said there were benefits to\nmoderating the pace of increases because it wou ld give you more information to make decisions.\nWould another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that\nslower pace and defer until the f all any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m just going to tell you again what we ’re going to do. I n\nSeptember, we ’re going to look at , at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots\nof activity data, and that ’s what we ’re going to look at , and we ’re going to make that decision\nthen. And that decision could, could mean another hike in , in September, or it could mean that\nwe decide to maintain at that level. And, again, the question we ’re going to be asking ourselves\nis, is the overall signal one that we need to do more , that we need to tighten further ? And if we\nget that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that ’s the collective judgment of the Committee —\nthen we will move ahead. If we don’ t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining\npolicy at that level, but it ’s, it’s, you know, it ’s really dependent so much on the data , and we just\ndon’t have it yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi . Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. So consumer\nconfidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part becaus e of, of the declines in headline\ninflation . You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long\ntime. How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of\n3 percent ? And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side\nof the dual mandate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I ’d say it this way : First, it is —it is a good thing that\nheadline inflation has come down so much, because that ’s really what the public experiences .\nAnd, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a —it\nwill strengthen the broad sense that , that the publ ic has that inflation is coming down, which will\nin turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really —sorry, your question\nwas?\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Well, I mean , you ’ve talked for many press conferences\nnow about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of that are we\nstill seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would put it this way. W e, we—I’d say it this way : It’s\nreally a question of , how do you balance the two r isks, the risk of doing too much or doing too\nlittle? And, you know, I would say that , you know, we ’re coming to a place where, where there\nreally are risks on both sides. It ’s hard to say exactly whether , whether they ’re in balance or not,\nbut as our —as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do\nincreasingly face that risk. But , you know, we , we need to see that inflation is durably down\nthat far, you know .\nAs you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better\nsignal of , of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by\nvolatile energy and food prices . So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because\nthat’s what we think—that ’s—core is sign aling where headline is going to go in the future. And\ncore inflation is still pretty elevated, you know? There ’s reason to think it can come down now,\nbut it ’s, it’s still quite elevated , and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we ’re\n\ngoing to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time. And we need to\nbe prepared to raise further if that—if we think that ’s appropriate.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Well, and then if inflation were to —just a quick\nfollow [up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in\nunemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation? People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so -called last mile of inflation. So—but how much?\nAgain, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is —it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment\nrate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent . So that ’s a real\nblessing in that we ’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’ t seek to it . It’s not\nthat we ’re aiming to , to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record —we have\nto be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and\nslow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market\nconditions. And so that is still the , the likely outcome here. And, you know, we hope that that ’s\nas little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is —that is the likely outcome.\nThe worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not\nget it done . Whatever the short -term social cost s of getting inflation under control, the longer -\nterm social costs of failing to do so are greater , and the historical record is very, very clear on\nthat. If you go through a pe riod where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is\nvolatile, it interferes with people ’s lives and with economic activity , and, you know, that ’s the—\nthat’s the thing we , we really need to avoid and will avoid.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael McKee.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. At this point, you say the policy is restrictive , but all year long we\nhave seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to\nthe downside. So I ’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now\nunder these conditions ? Do you think you might need to do more , because I ’m curious about\nwhat you see as inflation dynamics now ? Is the economy still moving in a direction where it\ncreates more inflation? People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have\nsome large labor settlements. Or is the economy disinflating, and you’ re just, you’ re able to go\nback to the old F ed policy of opportunistic disinflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,\nwe want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic -related distortions to\ndemand and supply. W e want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to\nhelp ease inflationar y pressures. W e want to see continued restoration of supply and demand\nbalance, particularly in the labor market. A nd all of that should lead to declining inflationary\npressures.\nNow what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together . And we ’re\nseeing evidence of those things now, but I would —I would say that what , what our eyes are\ntelling us is that policy has not been restrictive long , restrictive enough for long enough to have\nits full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep pol icy restrictive until we ’re confident that\ninflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we ’re prepared to further\ntighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process, you know, still probably has a , a long\nway to go.\nMICHAEL MCKE E. Well , do you think under current conditions you are restrictive\nenough unless something changes?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think —we think, you know, today’ s rate hike was\nappropriate , and I think we ’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at\nthe next meeting about , is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more ? And if it does\ntell us that —collectively , if that ’s our view —then we will do more.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. If September is ,\nin fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the f unds rate steady at the\nJune meeting?\nCHAIR POWE LL. So a more gradual pace doesn ’t go immediately to [moving] every\nother meeting. It could be two out of three meetings, right? It could be —it just means if you ’re\nslowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as , as we get closer and\ncloser to , we think, our destination. And I wouldn’ t want to go automatically to [moving] every\nother meeting , because I just don ’t think that ’s—we don’ t—I think it ’s not an environment\nwhere we want to provide a lot of forward guidance . There’s a lot of uncertainty out there .\nWe just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes\nall the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that’s what we did. And so I , I think it’ s possible . I mentioned it before . It’s possible that we\nwould move at consecutive meetings —we ’re not taking that off the table —or we might not. It ’s\nreally going to depend on what the data tell us. That’s the best we can do.\nCOLBY SMITH. So we shouldn’ t assume that every other meeting is the lowest\ntightening frequency, let ’s say ? It could be , you know, longer intervals in between as well ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we ’re—look, I think we ’re going to—we’re going to make a\ndecision about the next meeting, an d then we ’re going to make a decision about the one after\nthat. And I think it ’ll sort itself out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, among your\ncolleagues, there have been people who’ ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken\nplace so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it ’s\nhappened very fast this time , and it ’s kind of up to date. Where are you on that continuum?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the re’s a long -running debate about the lags between changes in\nfinancial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right? So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our\ndecisions , and that has clearly been the case in this cycle. So , in a sense, the clock starts earlier\nthan it —than it used to.\nBut that doesn’ t necessarily change the process from that point on , and it ’s not clear that\nit has. We also —this is —I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’ t know. We know\nthat financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags , plural, that can be long and variable —a lot of uncertainty around the length of\nthe lags. A nd, by the way, that ’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.\nSo I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this . First, the first thing to say is, we ’re\ndetermined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we will use our tools to do that .\nNo one should doubt that. I would look at it this way, though. T he real federal funds r ate is now\nin meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal f ederal funds r ate, subtract the\nmainstream estimate of near -term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds r ate that is\n\nwell above most estimates of the longer -term neutral rate. So I would say, monetary policy is\nrestrictive, more so after today ’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on\neconomic activity and inflation. We ’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’ s not\nappropriate to do so. So that ’s how I think about it.\nI mean , if I sum it up, I would say : We’ve come a long way. W e are resolutely\ncommitted to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. Inflation has proved,\nrepeatedly , has proved stronger than we and other forecasts —forecasters have expected , and at\nsome point , that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data , and given how far we ’ve\ncome, we can afford t o be a little patient , as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. On the —on the credit side, I ’m wondering if you saw\nanything in the —in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’ re getting a quantum of\ncredit contraction beyond wha t you’ d expect . The bank lending data really is —the growth rate ’s\nedging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession\nindicator.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week , and I\nwould just sa y it’s broadly condition —consistent with what you would expect. You ’ve got\nlending conditions tight and getting a little tighter . You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it ,\nit gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it’ s really hard to tease\nout whether —how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is , the\noverall picture is of tight and tightening lending condi tions. And that ’s, that’s what the SLOOS\nwill say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell. Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what\nshare of that credit you would give to factors that don’ t stem directly from rate hikes or that\nmight be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the\ninflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and, and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and m onetary policy. And we ’ve always expected that the\ndisinflationary process would stem from , both from the normalization of those broad pandemic -\nrelated supply and demand conditions and from restrictive , restrictive monetary policy , which\nwould help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think\nthat’s broadly what we ’re—what we’re seeing.\nSo to go, break it down a little further : Of course , headline inflation has come down\nsharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine . And that ’s, that’s a\ngood thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.\nFor core inflation, I’ d say there also —there has been a role for , for most —for , for both\nfactors, both that I mentioned. Clearly , for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing\nan important role , as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal , of spending—back into\nservices and away from goods.\nAnd take autos as an example . The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,\nwhile , while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial rol e for supply, but there ’s\n\nalso a role for demand , as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive . So\nthey’ re both working there. Housing services inflation now starts to move down. C learly , higher\nrates have, have slowed the housing market. You know, I would say, monetary policy is\nworking about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,\nin particular in nonhousing services , where , really, we think that ’s, that’s where the labor market\nwill come in as a very , very important factor. So we think both of those —both of those sources\nof disinflation are playing an important role.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I see. A nd just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,\nthat core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes , or is there a more even split\nthere , too?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward\nbecause we, we’ re sort of reaping now the benefits of the —of the reversal of some of the very\nspecific pandemic things. We’ re seeing that with goods , in particular, with s upply chains and\nshortages moving, and we ’re seeing —so I think going forward, monetary policy will be\nimpo rtant, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. First, let me compliment your tie,\nthe choice of tie. I t’s a good color. So thanks for taking our questions. So the Beige Book, it\nsaid, “Input cost pressures remain ed elevated for services firms but eased notably ” for\nmanufacturing sectors. Is that an indication that there ’s a, a wage inflation pressure? And how\ndo you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think th at, as it relates to goods, it ’s really an indication that\nsupply chains and, and shortages are easing. And so , what was the first part of it?\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So, wage inflation. Like , how do you—how do you target\nwage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t —I don ’t think we ’re targeting wage inflation. I think what\nwe’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that ’s what\nwe’re seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down. T hey’re still at levels what\nwould—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.\nNonetheless, we ’re making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is\ncooling. You can —you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that . You can\nlook at the quits rate normalizing . You can look at job openings coming down. You can look at\njust job creation in the , the establishment survey has, you know —it’ s still at a high level, but it\nwas at , really , an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.\nSo you see cooling, particularly in private sector , in the last, you know, in the last report.\nSo I think we see that, and it ’s happening at a gradual pace. So that ’s actually not a bad thing, in\na sense, because if , if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is\nreally the engine of the economy—p eople are getting hired, many people going back to work,\ngetting wages, spending money—and that ’s really what ’s driving the economy but that i t’s\ngradually slowing, it ’s gradually cooling, that ’s a good prescription for getting where we want\nto get.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But still we see a push to raise minimum wage . We’re seeing\na lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is , they come out with\nagreements like big pay increases, like UPS , and we have the autoworkers coming up. Are you\nconcerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contract s, pushing wage inflation\nthen?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Not for us to comment on , on contract negotiations. Not our job, not\nour role. You know, we , we monitor these things , and we ’ll keep an eye on them, but , really,\nthat’s something that ’s, that’s handled at that level and not —\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the S EP,\nwhich suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under\n3 percent. And so I ’m wondering, is the level of inflation what ’s sort of important there as you\nthink about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which\ninflation is falling also important?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you’d take both into account. I think you’d take everything\ninto account when you start cutting rates. It would —it would depend on the whole, on a wide\nrange of things. And when , when people are writing dow n rate cuts next year, you know, it just\nis a sense that inflation is coming down , and we ’re comfortable that it’ s coming down, and it ’s\ntime to start cutting rates. I think —but I mean , there ’s a lot of uncertainty between what\nhappens , you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year , let alone the year after\nthat. So it ’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there , what’s motivating people.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So if it’ s sort of —sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you\nwouldn’ t necessaril y cut rates ?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not going— I’m not saying that at all. I ’m not giving you any\nnumerical guidance around that. I’m saying we would—we ’d be comfortable cutting rates when\nwe’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won ’t be this year , I don’ t think . It would be —you\nknow, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year. I think the median was several for next\nyear. And that ’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now ,\n\nand it ’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is , in fact, coming down to our 2 percent\ngoal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the\nFed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing , and they’ ve reduced their forec ast for a\nrecession. And I ’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession\nbeing likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident\nthat you can achieve a soft landing.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and\nmy base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we ’ve seen in\nsome past —in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That ’s\nbeen my view . That’s, that’s still my view. And I think, you know, that that ’s sort of consistent\nwith, with what I see today. So —but it ’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have\na lot left to go to see that happen.\nSo the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the\nforecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer fore casting a\nrecession. I just want to note that it’ s—that our staff produces its own forecast , which is\nindependent of the forecast s that we as FOMC participants produce. H aving an independent\nstaff forecast as well as the individual participant forecast s is really a strength of our —of our\nprocess. There ’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that , that helps us make —\ninforms our deliberations —helps us make , I hope , better decisions.\n\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and\nyou still have a strong labor market? I mean , does that add to the optimism?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t use the term “ optimism” about this yet. I would—I would\nsay, though, that there ’s a pathway , and , yes, that ’s, that’s a good way to think about it. We’ ve,\nwe’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And\nthat’s, that’s a really good thing. I would just also say the historical record suggest s that there ’s\nvery likel y to be some softening in labor market conditions . And consistent with having a soft\nlanding, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that ’s still\nlikely as we —as we go forward with this process. But it’ s a good thing to date that we haven ’t—\nwe haven’t really seen that.\nWe’ve seen softening through other —not through unemployment, not through higher\nunemployment . We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the\nway back to more normal levels ; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much ; we’ve seen\nparticipation —people coming in, and so labor supply has , has improved, which has lowered the\ntemperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated , you know, going back a year or so.\nSo we ’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that ’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it\ncontinues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. J eff.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. You and other Fed\nofficials in the past have suggested that you don’ t need to keep hiking until inflation hits\n2 percent, that —as long as you see continued progress. So I ’m wondering, how close do you\nneed to get with the inflation numbers coming down? How many months of data do you need to\n\nsee that will —that will give you sufficient confidence , and how , how far does this fight need to\ngo before you’ re willing to kind of declare victory on it?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to\n2 percent —it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target. That ’s, that’s\nclearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we ,\nwe—the median participant—and, again, these are forecast ing out years, so take them with a\ngrain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the f ederal\nfunds r ate is at a restrictive level now.\nSo if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’ t need to be at a\nrestrictive level anymore . We can , you know, we can move back to a —to a neutral level and\nthen below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, you know, we would—we , of\ncourse , would be very careful about that . We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming\ndown in a sustainable level. And it ’s hard to make —I’m not going to try to make a numerical\nassessment of when and where that would be. Bu t that’ s the way I would think about it, is you ’d\nstart—you’ d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation , and you’ d start cutting before\nyou got to 2 percent inflation , too, because we don’ t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation\nuntil—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. It ’s been over four months since a handful of regional banks, including Silicon\nValley Bank, failed. When you look at credit conditions now, given Banc of California ’s\nacquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt , or are you\n\ncomfortable saying that we ’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this\npoint ? And how does this play into your outlook for policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’ t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I\nwill say , things have settled down for sure out there. Deposit flows have stabilized . Capital and\nliquidity remain strong. Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up\nsignificantly year over year. Banking- sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.\nAnd, overall , the banking system remains strong and resilient. Of course , we’re still watching ,\nyou know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the\nbanking sector.\nIn terms of the , the actual effect on —if you think of a particular set of banks that were,\nwere affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more\naffected by the turmoil in March than others , it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort\nof tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening. They may be\ntightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.\nThe SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are\ntightening. That process is ongoing, and that w ill restrain economic growth. So I think —I think\nwe have to take a step back from “ I can ’t separate those anymore.” I think —I think , basically ,\nwe’re just looking at the overall picture , which is one of tightening credit conditions. And that ’s,\nthat’s going to restrain economic activity . It is restraining economic activity. So that ’s how I\nwould look at it.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And how is that informing your outlook for setting\npolicy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we —that goes —that ’s—an expected result of tightening\ninterest rate policy is that—is th at bank credit conditions —bank lending conditions would\ntighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened\nin May? I just don’ t think we know that. I think we ’re looking at the current data in GDP , and\nwe’re seeing strong spending. We’ re seeing a strong economy, and it ’s made us confident that\nwe can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. And I —it\nseems like the economy is weathering this well, but , of course , we’re watching it carefully and,\nand expect to continue to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan\nCassella with Barron’ s. I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary\nimpact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer\nsentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we ’ve been seeing.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that\nincreases in] real wages are positive. Again, that ’s a great thing. Of course , we want that . We\nwant people to have [gains in] real wages. B ut we want wages to be going up at a level that ’s\nconsistent with , with 2 percent inflation over time. As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages\nhave been coming down gradually, and that ’s what we want to see. W e expect to see more of\nthat. That ’s just more of what’ s consistent o ver a longer period of time. We don’ t really think\nthat, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak. But I\nwould say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor market conditions broadly a re going to be an important part of , of getting inflation back down, and that ’s why we\nthink we need some further softening in labor market conditions.\n\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you\nmentioned at the start how you’ re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might\nbe some sort of a rebound there, and I ’m curious what the Fed ’s explanation would be to families\nif further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to , you know, drive that sentiment\nback down. What ’s the message there of , of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise\nthem?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get\ninflation under control. And we think the , the single most important thing we can do to benefit\nthose very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get\ninflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most\nimportant thing we can do now , and we ’re determined to do that.\nAnd I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away\nare people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’ re talking about travel or,\nyou know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those —if you’ re\njust making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’ re in trouble right\naway. Even middle -class people have some resources and can absorb inflation . People, people\non the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that. So we need —we need to\nget this done . And, you know, the record is clear that if we —if we take too long or if , if we\ndon’t succeed , that the pain will only be greater. So that ’s, that’s how I would explain what\nwe’re doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVI TCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovi tch with t he\nEconomist. You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one. In\n\nthe event , the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate\nmove that you announced today. The decision was, of course , unanimous, and the statement was\nbasically unchanged from last month. So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting\nactually a live one? Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was, was actually going to be?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I mean , you could—“ Was there doubt? ” Look, I would say\nthere ’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks , you’ ll\nsee that. There ’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should\ndo at the ne xt meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through. Many times when we go\ninto a meeting, the decision is not , you know, fundamentally in doubt. Nonetheless, we have the\nmeeting , and some —some —some meetings are , you know, less uncertain than others , and I ’ll\njust leave it at that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell.\nFinancial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks —the dollar, the\nstock market, et cetera. What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come\ndown to target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we monitor , of course , financial conditions, broad financial\nconditions. You’re right . It’s the dollar and equities, but —and, you know, we ’re, of course ,\nvery focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will —we ’re going to use our policy\ntools to —working through financial conditions —to get inflation under control The implication\nis, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that , that could\nmean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more. But what tends to happen,\n\nthough, is , financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we ’re doing, and , and,\nultimately , over time , we get where we need to go.\nEVAN RYSER. If I could also ask about the S EP from June that showed rate cuts—d o\nyou expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that , that could happen. The question is, you know, is that\nconsistent with , with —so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it ’s a world\nwhere things are okay , and it ’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more\nnormal levels. Normalization , in the case of , of the balance sheet , would be to reduce QT or to\ncontinue it , depending on where you are in the cycle. So they are two independent t hings . And,\nyou know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates. But you can imagine circumstances\nin which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different\nways. But that wouldn’ t be the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Thanks , Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I\nhave a question about the discount window. I ’m wondering if , since the bank failures of the\nspring, if you’ ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that\nthey’ re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether\npolicies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to , to show tha t\nthey are prepared to use it . Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s a very important thing . Yes. A nd yes to both sides of that .\nYou know , yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window ,\nand we are strongly encouraging them to do that —banks broadly. We did find, as you know,\nduring the events of March and that , you know, that it ’s a little clunkier . It can be a little\n\nclunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes. So why not be in a situation where , where\nyou’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window ?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Mark Hamrick.\nMARK HAMRICK. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. You ’ve talked in the\npast about getting the housing market back into better balance —excuse me—and also that the\nmarket might have bottomed. Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right\nnow, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might\notherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,\nof course, also all of that happening with the 30 -year fixed -rate mortgage still around 7 percent\non the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’ re talking about tightening industry lending\nstandards? Are we getting closer to balance or farther away? What ’s your sense?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we ’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance , really , for the\nreasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have\nlow-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they ’re not going\nto because they have such, so much , value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing\nhomes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.\nOn the other hand, there ’s, you know, there ’s a lot of supply coming on line now , and,\nand there are people coming in . A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first -time buyers coming\nin, buying at , you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.\nBut I think this will take some time to work through . Hopefully, more supply comes on line ,\nand, you know, we , we work through it. We ’re still living through the , you know, the aftermath\nof the —of the pandemic.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ ll go to Nancy for the last question.\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace . Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage\nthrough the Black Sea , and alternative routes at this point could be closed off. Just wondering,\nhow could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, a nd how closely are you\nwatching that?\nCHAIR POWELL. We are watching it, of course, very closely. And you’ re right . The\nwithdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security,\nparticularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food. Grain prices did go up on this news , but they remain well below their peaks of last spring. And the moves that we ’ve seen\nso far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation. Of course , we will be watching that situation carefully.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. So you don’ t think it would have a big effect on Fed\npolicy at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Doesn ’t. You wouldn’ t say so looking at what we —what we\nknow now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."
