My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made considerable progress toward our dual -mandate objectives. Inflation has\neased substantially while the labor market has remained strong , and that is very good news. But\ninflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path\nforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nRestoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefit s all.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting\ndownward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and\nprogress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals\nare moving into better balance . I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP\nexpanded 3.1 percent , bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply\nconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year , largely reflecting high\nmortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weigh ed on business fixed investment. In\nour Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to\nslow from last year’s pace , with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over\nthe next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,\nreflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.\n\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to\ncome into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs\nper month. The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent. Strong job\ncreation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers , reflecting increases in\nparticipation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.\nNominal wage growth has been easing, and job v acancies have declined. Although the jobs -to-\nworkers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC\nparticipants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on\ninflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this\nyear and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of\n2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE\nprices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile\nfood and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer -term inflation\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets. The\nmedian projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year , 2.2 percent\nnext year, and 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\nThe Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities\nholdings. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks\nto achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. We believe that\nour policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves\nbroadly as expected, it will likel y be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some\npoint this year. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to\ninflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for\nlonger, if appropriate.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation\nback to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly\nweaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range\nfor the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks. Th e Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce\nthe target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down\ntoward 2 percent. Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate , and an\nunexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response. We will\ncontinue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this\n\nyear, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026 , still above the medium —\nmedian longer -term funds rate. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the\neconomy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nTurning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion\nsince the Committee began reducing our portfolio . At this meeting, we discussed issues related\nto slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings. While we did not make any decisions\ntoday on this , the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of\nrunoff fairly soon , consistent with the plans we previously issued. The decision to slow the pace\nof runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would\notherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually. In particular,\nslowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition , reducing the possibility that\nmoney markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities\nholdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves .\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping our longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is\nessential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long\nterm.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We , at the\nFed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve .\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the projections show\nsomewhat higher core inflation . They also show somewhat stronger growth. What should we\ninfer from this notion that, on average , rates were kept the same this year , but inflation is higher\nand growth is higher. Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness\nto slow the economy to achieve that target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, it doesn ’t—no, it doesn ’t mean that. What it means is that , you\nknow, we’ve seen incoming —as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our\ngrowth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing , performing\nwell. And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter , and I think that caused\npeople to write up their inflation . But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on\nbringing inflation down . And so —\nSTEVE LIESMAN. When you —just to follow up: When you say that you ’re willing to\neither maintain the rate for longer, is —what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation\ncoming in above its 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent\nover time. That is —that is our goal , and we will achieve that goal. Markets believe we will\nachieve that goal . And they should believe that, because that ’s what —that’s what will happen\nover time. But we stress “over time. ” And so I think we ’re, we’re making projections that do\nshow that happening . And we ’re committed to that outcome , and we will bring it about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell . Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You and other s have been saying that relief on housing inflation is\n\ncoming, but it still hasn ’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE. Does that challenge\nyour assumption about when the shift will finally break through , since it hasn ’t at that point ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think there ’s some confidence that the market rents —lower\nmarket rent increases that we ’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation\nover time. There ’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen , but there ’s real\nconfidence that they will show up eventually over time. But, again, uncertainty about the exact\ntiming of that .\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Okay. And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if\nhousing doesn ’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time. We\nwill. And, and I would assume that we ’ll continue to see is —we’ll see goods prices coming into\na new equilibrium where they ’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this\nyear, where housing services inflation will come back down as , as current market rents are\nsuggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down. Some\ncombination of those three things —and it may be different from the combination we had before\nthe pandemic —will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, during your\ncongressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest\nrates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest\nrates are well above neutral. At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first\ncut is highly consequential. Can you reconcile these views for me? If rates are well above\n\nneutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential? Is that because you anticipate one cut\nwould be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,\nwhich itself was modeled on the mid -cycle adjustment of 1995?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s more —I would put it more in the context of what I said in our —\nin my opening remarks that the risks are really two -sided here . We—we’re in a situation where ,\nyou know, if we ease —if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if\nwe ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people ’s working lives. And\nso, you know, we do see the risks as two -sided, so it is consequential . We want to be careful .\nAnd, fortunately , with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation\ncoming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that. That’s\nreally what I was thinking.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. How much of that inflation that we ’ve seen so far this year do you\nchalk up to one -off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some\nchange in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I want to start by being —saying I always try to be careful about\ndismissing data that we don ’t like. So you need to check yourself on that , and I ’ll do that . But—\nso I would say the January number, which was very high —the January CPI and PCE numbers\nwere quite high . There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there. But,\nnonetheless, we don ’t want to be completely dismissive of it. The February number was high,\nhigher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which\nis not terribly high. So it’s not like the January number. But I take the two of them together , and\nI think they haven ’t really changed the overall story , which is that of inflation moving down\ngradually on a sometimes -bumpy road toward 2 percent. I don ’t think that story has changed. I\n\nalso don ’t think that those readings added to anyone ’s confidence that we ’re moving closer to , to\nthat point . But, you know, we didn ’t—the last thing I ’ll say is we didn ’t excessively celebrate\nthe good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year. We didn ’t take too much\nsignal out of that . What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could , you\nknow —we wanted to be careful about that decision , and we ’re not going to overreact , as well , to\nthese two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Ann.\nANN SAPHIR. Hi, yes , Chair Powell. Could you speak a little bit more about the\ntiming? Is there enough data between now and , say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence\nthat you say you still need ? Or, by June , is there enough data for you? Just give us a sense of\nyour thinking there. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . So we make decisions meeting by meeting . And we didn ’t\nmake any decisions about future meetings today. Those are going to depend on our ongoing\nassessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. So I really don ’t\nhave anything for you on any specific meeting , looking forward.\nANN SAPHIR. I mean just a question of —I mean , is there even enough data for you to\nbe able to —\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll take —you know, things can happen during an inter meeting\nperiod , if you look back —unexpected things. So I don ’t want to —I wouldn ’t want to dismiss\nanything. So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher\nconfidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent. I also mentioned —and\nwe don ’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,\nparticularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of\n\nreducing rates . Again, I don ’t—there ’s nothing in the data pointing at that , but those are the\nthings that we ’ll be looking at , at coming meetings and —without trying to refer to any specific\nmeeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press. Thank you. In\nthe projections , there is an increase in the neutral rate , as you know, and higher rates —¼ point\nhigher rates projected in 2025, 2026. Can you speak about why, [ what ] might be behind that? Is\nthere a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will\nbe needed in the future? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you ’re right. They ’re pretty modes t changes , but you ’re right .\nThere was an uptick in the longer -run rate, and also there ’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and\n’26. In terms of , are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that ’s really your question, I\ndon’t think we know that. I think it ’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the\npre-pandemic post –Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly , you know, important,\nslow -moving , large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing —things that\ndon’t move quickly. But I don ’t think we know. I mean , my instinct would be that rates will not\ngo back down to the very low levels that we saw , where , all around the world , there were long -\nrun [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases. I don ’t see rates going back\ndown to that level . But I think there ’s tremendous uncertainty around that.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow [-up]. On the projections , you also\nhave 2. 6 percent core inflation for the end of this year. It’s already at —or you mentioned it\nbeing 2.8 in February . I mean , that doesn ’t sound like much disinflation at all. So are you really ,\nare you still confident or —at the last press conference , you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you\n\nwould get more confidence at the end of this year. Is it right to say that this suggests you ’re not\nseeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we ’ve seen 2023 and so forth?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think that that higher year -end number reflects the data we ’ve seen\nso far this year because you ’re now —you’re now in this year . So I think that —sorry, say your\nlast part of your question again.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Are you still optimistic that you ’ll get the confidence you need this\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know , I think , if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is\nstill likely in most people ’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate\ncuts. But that ’s really going to depend on the incoming data . It is. The other thing is, in the\nsecond half of the year , you have some pretty low readings , so it might be harder to make\nprogress as you move that 12 -month window forward. Nonetheless, we ’re looking for data that\nconfirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence\nthat what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent —toward 2 percent.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times. Thank you for taking our\nquestions. Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to\npotentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in\nthe labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts ? And just in general, if labor supply\ncontinued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly\nstronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . So, so, if what we ’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of\ndemand , and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they ’re\nspending and that ’s, you know —what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last\n\nyear, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing. In fact, they\nwere decreasing . So you can have that if you have a continued supply -side activity that we had\nlast year with —both with supply ch ains and also with , with growth in the size of the labor force.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to\nhold off on rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, not all by itself . No . I mean , we saw —you saw last year very\nstrong hiring and inflation coming down quickly. We now have a better sense that a big part of\nthat was supply -side healing, particularly with , with growth in the labor force. So, in and of\nitself, strong job growth is not a reason , you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell . Neil Irwin with Axios. How do you assess the state of\nfinancial conditions right now , and particularly —in particular , do you view the kind of easing in\nfinancial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you ’re trying to\nachieve on the inflation mandate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we think —there are many different financial conditions\nindicators , and you can kind of , you know, see different answers to that question. But,\nultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity , and we think\nyou see that in —a great place to see it is in the labor market , where you ’ve seen demand cooling\noff a little bit from the extremely high levels . And there I would point to job openings, quits,\nsurveys, the hiring rate . Things like that are really demand. There are also supply -side things\nhappening, but I think those are demand -side things happening. You know, w e saw—that’s been\na question for a while . We did see progress on inflation last year —significant progress , despite\nfinancial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you\ngive us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now? What\nwe’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one -off increases that will fade , or is there\nmore of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky ? And also\nhousing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle , in that you keep expecting them to go\ndown , and they don ’t. How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you ’ve\nraised your inflation forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking\nthe same question you ’re asking and saying we ’re just going to have to see what the data show.\nAs I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can —and I think\nmany people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there . But, again, you don ’t\nwant to —you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don ’t like. So\nthen February wasn ’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher. So the question is, what are we going to\nsee? You know, w e tend to see a little bit stronger —this is in the data —a little bit stronger\ninflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year. We’re going to —\nwe’re going to let the data show. I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the\nroad or something more. We’ll have to find out. In the meantime, the economy is strong , the\nlabor market is strong , inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach\nthis question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at\n2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well , you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that\ninflation is continually moving down. Have the recent numbers we ’ve gotten for inflation data\ndented that confidence at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. It certainly hasn ’t improved our confidence —it hasn’t raised\nanyone ’s confidence . But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of\ninflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes -bumpy path, as I mentioned.\nI think that ’s what you still see. We’ve got nine months of 2 ½ percent inflation now , and we ’ve\nhad two months of kind of bumpy inflation. We were saying that we ’ll—it’s going to be a\nbumpy ride. We consistently said that. Now here are some bumps , and the question is , are they\nmore than bumps? And we just don ’t—we can ’t know that. That’s why we are approaching this\nquestion carefully . It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation\nsustainably down . And I think the historical record, it ’s—every situation is different , but the\nhistorical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the\nfirst time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately —\nprematurely.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with FOX\nBusiness. I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from —well, the Federal Reserve is an\nindependent body , understanding Congress has oversight over that. You received a letter from\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said —calling on you to lower interest\nrates —to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too\nlong, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant\nclimate and economic benefits from these projects. ” So has higher interest rates caused that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Have they —well, first of all, I respect our —you know, in our system\nof government , it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed. We place a\ntremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them\nwith great respect. In this case, I would say, those are , you know —our mandate is for maximum\nemployment and price stability and the other things that we do , and that ’s what we ’re trying to\naccomplish. We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we ’re seeing, the\nstrong labor market we ’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation. That’s\nhow we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly\nimportant, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for\nthose.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying\nthat the higher rates are squeezing the working people. How do these letters affect what you\nguys are doing , policy -wise?\nCHAIR POWELL. We receive these letters with respect , and we write careful responses\nand address concerns . We listen, again, because we ’re talking to the people who , in our system\nof government , have oversight over our activity. So that ’s—but at the end of the day, we take\nthat on board , but we have to make our judgments , and we have to “stick to our knitting ”—\nwhich is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the\npayment system : the things that we do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Thank you. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thanks a lot for the\nopportunity to ask a question. As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the\n\nCommittee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting\nrates? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re a very consensus -oriented organization , and we do try to\nachieve consensus and , ideally , unanimity . People do dissent . It’s something that happens. Life\ngoes on , and it ’s not a problem. We’ve always had dissent s. But—and so I —you know, you\nrespect thoughtful dissents very much. It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but\nyou really want to understand them . So you may read a book that takes a position that you have\nlong opposed , just to understand [the position of] that book. So I treat dissents with real respect\nas well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Can you hear me?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Okay . Great. Obviously , inflation is some ways away from\ntarget . Unemployment , though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in\nFebruary , we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection. Are you\nconcerned at all that —notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth —that in fact there may be\nsome cracks appearing in the employment market? You talked about a significant deterioration\nin the labor market being a condition for easing rates. What would constitute that in your books?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , of course , monitor —it’s one of our two goal variables . We all\nmonitor the labor market very, very carefully. And I don ’t see those cracks today. And I, you\nknow —we follow all the possible stories that are out there about , about there being cracks , but\nthe overall picture really is a strong labor market . The extreme imbalances that we saw in the\n\nearly parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved. You’re seeing high job growth .\nYou’re seeing big increases in supply . You’re seeing strong wage growth , but wage growth is\ngradually moderating down to more sustainable levels . In many, many respects , the things are\nreturning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose . That’s\njob openings and quits . And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this :\nYou know, h ow tight is the —how easy is it to find a job ? How hard is it —how easy it is to find\na worker ? Those have both —those surveys have both come down.\nSo the labor market is —it’s in good shape . You know, y ou do see things like the low —\nthe low hiring rate , and people have made the argument that if , if layoffs were to increase, that\nwould —that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment. So\nthat’s something we ’re watching, but we ’re not seeing it. Of course , initial claims are very, very\nlow and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit. So—watching it carefully . Don’t see it.\nAnd when I say something —I, I use the term “unexpected ” weakening of the labor market. So,\nyou know, we do expect the unemployment rate to —the forecast is that it would move up, I\nthink , closer to what we see as the longer -run sustainable level . That’s just—that’s just people ’s\nforecast, individual forecasts. But we ’re talking about something that ’s unexpected. That’s\nwhere I ’ll leave it , though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. You mentioned at the\nbeginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the\npace of asset runoff fairly soon. I’m wondering is —when you say fairly soon, does that mean\nthat the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that\nsoon? And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is\n\ndiscussing here. You’re at $95 billion of caps right now . Would that be cut about in half or\nsomething in that nature? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that is what we ’re discussing essentially is —and we ’re not\ndiscussing all the other many other balance sheet issues. We will discuss those in due course .\nBut what we ’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff. There isn't much runoff among\nMBS—in MBS right now , but there is in Treasuries . And w e’re talking about going to a lower\npace. I don ’t want to give you a specific number because we haven ’t made a —haven ’t had an\nagreement or decision, but that ’s the idea. And that ’s what we ’re looking at.\nIn terms of the timing, I said fairly soon. I wouldn ’t want to try to be more specific than\nthat, but you get the idea. The idea is —and this is in our longer -run plans —that we may actually\nbe able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.\nLiquidity is not evenly distributed in a system . And there can be times when , in the aggregate,\nreserves are ample or even abundant , but not in every part . And those parts where they ’re not\nample, there can be stress , and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the\nstress . And then it would be very hard to restart , we think . So something like that happened in\n’19 perhaps . So that ’s what we ’re doing . We’re looking at what would be a good time and what\nwould be a good structure , and “fairly soon ” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. And will there be a discussion about returning to an all -\nTreasuries balance sheet at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that —our, our longer -run goal is to return to a balance sheet that\nis mostly Treasuries. I do expect that , once we ’re through this , we’ll come back to the other\nissues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it ’s, you know, not\n\nurgent right now. We want to get this , this decision made first and then we can, when the time is\nright, come back to the other issues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. Also on the balance sheet, you\nknow, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your\nbalance sheet plans? Do you worry that , as deposits start to shrink , that we could see more\nturbulence?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, w e’ll be watching carefully . But one of the reasons\nwe’re slowing down —we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down —is that we\nwant to avoid any , any kind of that turbulence. I wasn ’t think ing particularly about the banking -\nsector turbulence, but we —and we had some indicators the last time. This is our second time in\ndoing this, and I think we ’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to\nhappen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle\nwhere we wound up in a short [-of-]reserves situation. And w e don’t want to do that again. And\nI think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators. It isn ’t—it wasn ’t so much in the\nbanking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the\nadministered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates. Those sorts of\nthings. We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs , though.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Well, is it also because you ’re not sure exactly how the reserve\nsupply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near —at zero?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I think we broadly think that , once [take -up at] the overnight\n[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that , as the balance sheet\n\nshrinks , we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar -for-dollar with that.\nThat’s what we think.\nMICHELLE SMI TH. Let’s go to Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi Chair Powell . Jean Yung with MNI Market News. I wanted to ask\nalso about the balance sheet. Will you —you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a\nsmaller balance sheet size. Does that mean you don ’t have to make a decision on when to end\nQT at this point ? And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner , or will you\nwait until we ’re close to the end?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s sort of ironic that , by going slower , you can get farther . But\nthat’s the idea. The idea is that , with a smoother transition, you won ’t—you’ll run much less risk\nof kind of liquidity problems , which can grow into shocks , and which can cause you to stop the\nprocess prematurely. So that ’s—in terms of how it ends, we ’re going to be monitoring carefully\nmoney market conditions and asking ourselves whether they —what they ’re telling us about\nreserves. Are they —right now , we would characterize them as “abundant, ” and what we ’re\naiming for is “ample ” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant. So there isn ’t a—\nyou know, there ’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think\nwe have a really pretty clear understanding of that. We’re going to be looking at what these —\nwhat ’s happening in money markets , in particular —a bunch of different indicators, including the\nones I mentioned, to tell us when we ’re getting close. Then , though, you reach a point ultimately\nwhere you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you —but then, from that point, there ’s\nanother period in which nonreserves —nonreserve liabilities grow organically , like currency, and\nthat also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace. So you have a , you know, a slower pace of\nrunoff, which we ’ll have fairly soon . Then you have another time where you effectively hold the\n\nbalance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand . And then that ultimately\nbrings you, ideally, in for —brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above —you know,\nabove what we think the lowest possible ample number would be. We’re not trying for that . We\nwant to have a cushion, a b uffer , because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile .\nAnd we don ’t want to, again , find ourselves in a situation where there aren ’t reserves , and w e\nhave to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did\nin 2019 and ’20.\nMICHELLE SMITH: Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, you said you ’re waiting to become more confident that inflation ’s getting to your\n2 percent goal before you cut rates. Can you just sum up more specifically what data you ’re\nlooking at that would give you that confidence?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we ’re—most importantly , we’re looking at the incoming\ninflation data and the contents of it and what they ’re telling us , so that ’ll be—and also the\nvarious components —so obviously that ’s what we want . We want more confidence that\ninflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent. And, I mean , of course we ’ll also be\nlooking at all the other things that are happening in the economy . We’ll look at the totality of the\ndata, including everything essentially as we make that assessment . But the most important thing\nwill be the inflation data coming in.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Well, are there things that you would give more\nweight to , like wages?\nCHAIR POWELL. Wages is one thing. We don ’t—our target is not wages . It’s really\ninflation. But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong . But, but\n\nthey’ve been —wage increases , that’s to say —wage increases have been quite strong, but they ’re,\nthey’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time. And that ’s what\nwe want. We don ’t think that —the inflation was not originally caused —we think, I don ’t think,\nby mostly by wages. That wasn ’t really the story. But we do think that , to get inflation back\ndown to 2 percent sustainably, we ’d like to see , you know, continuing gradual movement of\nwage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you . Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, could you say\nat this meeting whether there were more officials who want ed to be careful and go slower than —\nabout rates —than there were at the last meeting? Was there —was there that sense of maybe it ’s\nsmart to wait? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I guess I ’d put it this way : The—if you look at the incoming\ninflation data that we ’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we\nwere right to wait until we ’re more confident. So I think , I think —I didn ’t hear anyone\ndismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that. So I think , generally\nspeaking , it does go in the direction of saying , yes, it ’s appropriate for us to be careful as we\napproach this question.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brendan.\nBRENDAN PEDERSEN. Thanks Chair Powell. Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl\nNews. I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff. We’ve been hearing a lot\nfrom Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn ’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know\nyou have said to Congress that you ’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything —\nlaunches anything . But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is\n\neither actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC. Can you\ngive us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I think we ’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will —\nI’ll try harder. So we are not getting ready to —we haven ’t proposed —we haven ’t come to a\nconclusion that we should propose , or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to\nauthorize a digital dollar. And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to\ngive us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the\npublic. So we ’re just a long, long way from that. What we are doing , and I think what every\nmajor central bank is doing, is we ’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what ’s going on in digital\nfinance , and it has many, many different areas . It has applications in wholesale finance, in the\npayment system, and so we need —to serve the public —these issues have become very front\nburner in the last five or six years —we need to be knowledgeable about all that. So we actually\ndo have people trying to understand things that are —but it ’s wrong to say that we ’re working on\na CBDC and that we ’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one , and we ’re just going to\nspring it on Congress at the right moment. We don ’t. I haven ’t at all , in my own mind , made a\ndecision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing. I just think it ’s something we\nneed to be —we need to understand. We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of\nthe broader payments landscape. That’s, that’s how I would characterize it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mark.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Mr. Chairman,\nApril 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news\nconferences. How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper\n\nfunctioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission ? And is there more that\nyou and your colleagues can do on the transparency front ? And what might that look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. I generally think —I mean , this movement actually started 30 years\nago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the\npublic understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you . They’ll react\nto the data. And so it all happens that way and so there ’s been a march toward greater and\ngreater transparency. And that —certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman\nGreenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I . You know, s o we went from four press conferences a\nyear to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now. I think that ’s a good innovation . I\nwouldn ’t want to turn it back.\nWe also have done a bunch of other things . You know, w e have an annual supervision\nreport, Financial Stability R eport . I mean , there ’s a long list of things that we ’ve done. I think\nyou—I mean , nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment .\nWe’re very transparent . We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public\nthrough the media. And so that channel is full , I would say. So I think it ’s generally broadly\nhelped and made things better . But not every day and in every way.\nMARK HAMRICK. Well , to follow up : Has there ever been a day where you wanted to\nput that genie back in the bottle somewhat?\nCHAIR POWELL. Of course not. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jennifer , for the last question.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you , Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation , but you did say earlier\nin this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn ’t raised anyone ’s confidence. But\n\nwhen you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not\nfar from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates. ” So are you still of\nthat belief or not? What are we to take by those words, “not far? ”\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say my main message at that —in those two days of\nhearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that\ninflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal , and we don ’t expect that it will\nbe appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we ’re more confident that that is the case. I said that\nany number of times , so those were kind of the main part of the message. We repeated that\ntoday in our statement. I also —to the language you mentioned, I , I really pointed out that we\nhad made significant progress over the past year, and what we ’re looking for now is confirmation\nthat that progress will continue. We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last\nyear that were really much lower . We didn ’t overreact , as I mentioned . But that ’s what I had in\nmind.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But given that you said that PCE for February,\n2.8 percent the estimate , and that we have been seeing PCE —core PCE coming down by a tenth\nof a percent every month, I mean , wouldn ’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June , July,\nto a point where you could cut then?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we ’ll just have to see how the data come in. We would , of\ncourse , love to get great inflation data. We got really good inflation data on the second —in the\nsecond part of last year . Again, we didn ’t overreact to it . We said we needed to see more , and\nwe said it would be bumpy . And now we have January and February, which I ’ve talked about a\ncouple of times. So, you know, we’re looking for more good data , and we would certainly\nwelcome it. Thank you."
