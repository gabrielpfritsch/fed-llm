  "text": "April 28 , 2021\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our\nsizable ass et purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on\nour balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\nWidespread vaccinations, alo ng with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also\nproviding strong support to the recovery. Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Household spending on goods has risen\nrobustly. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business\ninvestment and manufacturing production have also increased . Spending on services has also\npicked up, including at restaurants and bars . More generally, the sectors of the economy m ost\nadversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have show n improvement. While the\nrecovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from\ncomplete.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and\nthe measures undertaken to control its spread. Since March, progress on vaccinations ha s limited\nthe number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. While the lev el of new cases remain s\nconcerning, especially as it reflect s the spread of more infectious strains of the virus , continued\nvaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year. In the\n\nmeantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal\nas soon as possible.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove . Employment rose 916,000 in March , as the leisure and hospitality sector poste d a\nnotable gain for the second consecutive month. Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still\nmore than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a whole,\npayroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre -pandemic level. The unemployment rate\nremain ed elevated at 6 percent in March , and this figure understates the shortfall in employment,\nparticularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans\nand Hispanics. T he economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty\nabout the future.\nReadin gs on i nflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before\nmoderating. In the near term, 12- month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above\n2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past\nincreases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices . Beyond these effects, we are also\nlikely to see upward pressure o n prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues\nto reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one -time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on\ninflation.\n\nThe Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. As we say in our Stat ement on Longer -Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad- based and inclusive\ngoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and lo nger-term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range\nfor the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in\ninflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.\nIn addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least\n$80 bill ion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per\nmonth until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and\nprice -stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has mater ially eased\nfinancial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.\n\nOur guidance for interest rates and asset p urchases ties the path of the federal funds rate\nand the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals. This outcome -based\nguidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the\nrecovery progresses.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to c omplete the recovery .\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First we ’ll go Paul K iernan.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for doing this. I guess , since I ’m first,\nI’ll go ahead and re -up Howard ’s question from the last press conference : Is it time to start\ntalking about talking about tapering yet? Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to\nthis effect? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, no, i t is not time yet. We ’ve said that we would let\nthe public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we ’d do that well in\nadvance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so. In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progr ess toward our goals. We first articulated this “substantial further\nprogress ” test at our December meeting. Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked\nup after slowing over the winter. And it will take some time before we see substantial fu rther\nprogress.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jonnelle at Reuters.\n\nJONNELLE MARTE. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much. My question is about what ’s\ngoing on with the virus , and what if we don’ t reach a level of herd immunity, per se . So, in your\nscenario , thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you\nmight start to still normalize policy even if there ’s like a baseline of infection still going on? Or\nhow can you, you know, talk about how you’ re weighing those things?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s, so w e have to leave questions about herd immunity and what\nthat looks like to the health experts, but , but I would certainly say that what matters the most to\nthe economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus. The economy can’ t fully recover\nuntil people are confident that it ’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people. There\nmay be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’ t come back in unless they\nfeel really comfortable going bac k to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of\nthe economy that will —that just won ’t be able to , to really fully reengage until the pandemic is\ndecisively behind us.\nBut, you know, we ’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and\nfor lifting off and raising interest rates. So for , for asset purchases, we’ ve said that we w ould\ncontinue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward\nour goals. So —and that is , that is what it is, substantial further progress. For interest rates, as\nI—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum\nemployment , we want to see inflation at 2 percent , and we want to see it on track to exceed\n2 percent . So those are our tests. We don’ t have an independent test to do with the virus. I will\nsay, though, as I —as I started with, you know, the , the path of the virus is going to have an effect\non our ability to achieve both of those tests.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. Jeanna .\n\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if\nyou could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated. You ’ve\nobviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real\ndata and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move . But I guess I wonder\nwhat happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employmen t. You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the\nfact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how , how your reaction would\nbe—sort of how your reaction to that is , is—how you’ re thinking about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation\nmoving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market. I won ’t say that it ’s impossible, but it , it seems— it\nseems unlikely. It ’s much more likely that we would —having achieved maximum -employment\nconditions —we ’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving\nabove 2 percent . They tend to move together. So that ’s not to say inflation won’ t—might not\nmove up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that , that really starts to move inflation\nexpectations up, that would have to —that would take some time . And you would think that , that\nit would be quite likely that , that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening.\nIf it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a —there’s a paragraph in the —in\nthe Statement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy which says that when the two\ngoals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the , the time it would take to\nget back and [so] forth. So we do —it doesn’ t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we\nwill weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Lie sman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle ’s\nquestion, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID\ninfection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy. As you recall, we had a major\nresurgence in the virus last fall . And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there\nwasn ’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term —thinking\nabout thinking about tapering? And what kind of comfort level would you need? Would it be\nsomething that would be declared from the CDC or the , or the World Health Organization —for\nexample, downgrading the virus from a pandemic —before you have the comfort level to reverse\ncourse on policy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. W e, we really have —just articulated the goals that I’ve —that\nI’ve just mentioned a couple of times , which is substantial further progress toward our goals\nbefore we taper. Now, that ’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it ’s very likely going to be the\ncase that we ’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination\nand, and other —it, it—y ou know, those two things should more or less coexist.\nWe haven ’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we ’d like to achieve\nbecause we’ re not —you know, we ’re not experts in that area. We’ re, we’re really focused on the\neconomic outcomes, and, again, my , my guess is that we— it’s very likely, it seems to me, that\nfor us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates. W e\nwould also have to have made very substanti al progress in getting the virus under control —not ,\nnot necessarily fully under control. There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will , will have\nongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter\n\nas well. But we ’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal —substantial further\nprogress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SM ITH. Thank you. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you ’ve talked a lot during this\ncrisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there ’s not long- term scar ring in the economy . And I was just wondering, you know, given\nall of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long- term\nscarring? A nd, if so, you know, what are you most worried about? Where are you most worried\nabout that showing up?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say that we were very worried about scar ring, both in the\nlabor market from people being out of —out of the labor market for an extended period of time.\nThe evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you ’re out for a long time to get\nback in and get back to the life that you had. Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations. Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?\nThat was a big concern.\nI would say that , so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021. We haven ’t\nexperienced that level of scar ring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses. So\nwe’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago.\nNotwithstanding that, we ’re a long way from full employment. We’ re—you know, payroll jobs\nare 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020. We’ve got a long ways to go. A nd\nalso, it ’s going to be a different economy.\n\nSo we ’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are —they ’ve been looking at\ndeploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service\nindustries that have been employing a lot of people. You know, it , it may well be —it seems\nquite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service -sector jobs will struggle to\nfind the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had. These were people who were working in February of 2020. They clearly want to work. So those people are going to need —they’ re going to need help.\nAnd so, while I would say we haven ’t seen really highly elevated levels of\nunemployment for —you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended\nperiod of time, we ’ve still got a lot of people who are out to —out of work. We want to get them\nback to work as quickly as possible, and that ’s really one of the things we ’re trying to achieve\nwith our policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Sieg el.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell , for taking our\nquestions. The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars,\nand all -cash offers well above asking price. A nd this is happening at the same time that housing\nis becoming much more expensive for lower -income Americans and people who are still\nstruggling from the pandemic. Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles\nor that there ’s the potential f or that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course . And\nI would say that , before the pandemic, it ’s a very different housing market than it was before the\nGlobal F inancial C risis. And one of the main differences was that households were in very good\n\nshape financially compared to where they were. In addition, most people who got mortgages\nwere people with pretty high credit scores. There wasn ’t the subprime —you know, low -doc,\nno-doc lending practices were not there. So we don’ t have that kind of thing where we have a\nhousing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.\nThere ’s no q uestion, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we ’re watching that\ncarefully. It’s, it’s partly because there’ s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there ’s just not a lot\nof supply right now. So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up wi th the demand, clearly.\nInventories are tremendously low. We’re, we’re all hearing those stories. A nd if you’ re—if\nyou’re an entry level housing buyer, this is —this is a problem , because it just is going to be that\nmuch harder for people to get that first house , and that ’s a problem. I mean, we —it’ s part of a\nstrong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing. So, in\nthat sense, it ’s good. It ’s clearly the strongest housing market that we ’ve seen since the G lobal\nFinancial C risis. And, you know, my hope would be that , over time, housing builders can react\nto this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry.\nSo, you know, it is —it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and\nwe’re watching it very carefully. I don ’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns,\nthough, that really do reside around the housing sector. So ma ny of the financial crackups in all\ncountries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing. We don’ t—we really don’ t see that here. We don’ t see bad loans and unsustainable\nprices and that kind of thing.\nMICHEL LE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.\n\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the labor\nmarket. Do you—do you see things, such as in the Beige Book—you saw in the Beige Book\nanecdotes about businesses not able to find workers , [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear\nof getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth. Do you see these as also just sort of temporary\nbottlenecks that won’ t have much effect on the long- term health of the la bor market? Or how are\nyou thinking about these kinds of issues?\nCHAIR POWELL. Chris , you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your\nquestion. So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there : the tension\nbetween a hi gh level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’ t find —\nan elevated number of companies saying that they can’ t find workers. So, what ’s really going on\nthere?\nIt, it should be a number of different things. There are workers who don’ t actually have\nthe specific skills that the employers are looking for. There may be geographical differences. It,\nit may also be that, for example, there —one big factor would be , schools aren ’t open yet, so\nthere are still people who are at home taking c are of their children and would like to be back in\nthe workforce but can ’t be yet. There are people afraid of —there are virus fears that are\nweighing on people , so some —some people don’ t want to go back to work. There are also a\nsignificant number of peo ple who say they’ ve retired —a large number of people that say that\nthey’ re retired. Now, it ’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market\nstrengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books,\nif you will.\nSo—but clearly there ’s something going, going on out there, as , as many companies are\nreporting labor shortages. We don’ t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see\n\nthat in a real —you know, in a really tight labor market. And we may well start to see that. I do\nthink—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, an d it may be a different\nexpansion, we don’ t know, but , but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up. In\nother words, if you were worried about there —about running out of workers, it seemed like we\nnever did. You know, labor force participati on held up. People came in the labor force. They\nstayed in the labor force longer than expected.\nSo my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and\nthese jobs will be —the labor market will reach equilibrium. Maybe pay wi ll go up. B ut I do\nthink that —and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September,\nso to the extent that ’s a factor, which is not clear , it will no longer be a factor fairly soon. So my\nguess is, it will come back to this e conomy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor\nsupply and labor demand. It may take some months, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Heather Scott.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Could I do a q uick follow -up?\nMICHELLE SMITH. I’m sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Well [extended pause]\nMICHELLE SMITH. We, we lost you, Chris. Let ’s go on to Heather.\nHEATHER SCOTT. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you,\nyou know , you’ ve been hearing, of course, these concerns r aised by Larry Summers and others\nabout inflation and the fact that they think the Fed might be —might let things get out of hand\nwith the new policy stance. So my question is , can you tell us , what is different this time versus\nprevious periods like in the ’60s when inflation got out of control ? Why are you confident with,\n\nwith the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and make sure it\ndoesn’ t go too far above the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks for your question. S o I actually have a couple things I ’d like\nto say about inflation, including addressing your question. So let me start with just saying that\nwe’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability. Our , our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe\nthat having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long- term inflation\nexpectations at 2 percent . With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time ,\nthe Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times —above 2 percent for\nsome time.\nSo, with a , a little bit of context, we ’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented\nseries of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to\nwidespread reopening of economies in many places around the world. In the United States,\nfiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support : Vaccinations are now\nwidespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum. During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I ’ll discuss why.\nBut those pres sures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.\nIn an episode of one -time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing\nas, and is not likely to lead to , persistently higher year -over-year inflation into the future —\ninflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time. Indeed, it\nis the Fed ’s job to make sure that that does not happen. If, if , contrary to expectations, inflation\nwere to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move\nlonger -term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent , we would use our tools to bring\n\ninflation and expectations down to mandate -consistent levels. And I would say, if I may, that is\na principal difference from—we ’re all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and\n’70s, of course. And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time. We’ re\ncommitted to that, and we will use our tools to do that. So that ’s a very different situation than\nyou had back in the 1960s —or many, many differences , actually.\nSo let me talk quickly about the two reasons —two , or you could say three, but really two\nmain reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term. Th e first is the base effect s.\nTwelve -month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few\nmonths as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of\nthe calculation. That process has alr eady started to show up. You saw it in the March CPI\nreading, and you’ ll see it later this week in the PCE price data. These base effects will contribute\nabout 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in\nApril and May. So, significant increases, and they ’ll disappear over the following months. And\nthey’ ll be transitory. They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods. So that ’s\nbase effects.\nThe other big one I would talk about is bottleneck s. So this is what we ’re seeing in\nsupply chains in various industries, and we ’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries.\nYou know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits\nfor that matter, too. So what do we mean by a bottleneck? A bottleneck really is a temporary\nblockage or restriction in the supply chain for , for a particular good or goods, something that\nslows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market. We think of\nbottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt , and\nwe think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’ re temporary and\n\nexpected to resolve themselves. We know that the base e ffects will disappear in a few months.\nIt’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the\nbottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the\nmeantime.\nSo, you know, I ’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job. We will do our job. A nd\nwe are, we are focused —as you’ ve seen, for many years, we ’ve been focused on inflation\ndeviating below 2 percent , and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent . If,\nif we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation\nexpectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent . No one should doubt that we will do that. This is not what we expect . But no one\nshould doubt that , in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi.\nJAMES POLITI. Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that it would —thank you,\nChair Powell. You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal. Can you define what your , what your\ndefinition of “ a string of months ” is more specifically? And , on inflation, the FOMC said the\nrise in inflation we ’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described .\nBut why use the word “ largely, ” and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be\ntransitory , based on the initial data that you ’re seeing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what is “ a string ”? What do I mean by “ a string ”? Well, I would\nsay, what we have right now is one really good —I can tell you what it ’s not. It ’s not one really\ngood employment reading, which is w hat we got in March. We got close to a million jobs in\nMarch and a very strong labor market reading. And I was just suggesting that we ’d want to see\n\nmore like that. We’re 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that\ndoesn’ t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on.\nSo we have —we ’re a long way from our , our goals . And we don’ t have to get all the way to our\ngoals to taper asset purchases, w e just need to make substantial further progress. It ’s going to\ntake some time.\nOn, on “ largely, ” there are a bunch of factors. I was really thinking —we were thinking\nof the base effects and also the energy effects. I wasn ’t meaning to say there are some real\neffects. I mean, there are alway s—there are always relative prices going up and down within\ninflation. You know, there ’s a basket for CPI or PCE. There are, you know, many, many, many\nfactors that go into it. Relative prices are always moving up and down. This , this —we think it ’s,\nit’s very fair to say that the increases we see and , frankly , are about to see later this week are\nlargely due to base effects. It would have been more contentious to say “ entirely due to base\neffects ” because there are some things that are always going up , and so we just said “ largely. ”\nMICHELLE SMITH. [Inaudible]\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Over the\npast decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large- scale bank supervision —has\ncompletely overhauled that approach. And it ’s even created a special committee that looks\nhorizontally across the largest banks to find common risks. Did the Fed not see that multiple\nbanks ha d large exposures to Archegos? If not, why not? And then, what regulatory changes\nwould you like to see implemented to change that going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk -\nmanagement systems in place so that they can spot these things. We don’ t manage their\ncompanies for them or , or try to manage individual risks. In the gra nd scheme of these large\n\ninstitutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they\nwould have really created trouble for any of those institutions.\nWhat was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of\nfirms that is thought to be —to carry relatively well understood risks. The prime brokerage\nbusiness is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a num ber of them would\nhave had this . And it was essentially , I believe , the fact that, that they had the same big risk\nposition on with a number of firms, and they weren’ t—some of the firms were not aware that\nthere were other firms that had those things. I , I wouldn’ t say it’ s in any way an indictment of\nour supervision of these firms. It, it—i n some cases, it may be they were —it seems as though\nthere were risk -management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them. And that ’s what\nwe’re looking into.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall -Genzer.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. I —I’m wondering, are you\nplanning to visit the homeless encampm ent that’s near the Fed in Washington that you drive by?\nHave you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, frankly, yes. I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I ’ve\nbeen very busy, but I will visit. I don ’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention ,\nbecause I don ’t want that to be part of the story. But I will— I will go visit when, when it’ s no\nlonger a , a news story . And I—you know, I —I’ve met with homeless people many times, a\nnumber of times, anyway, let ’s say. And I , I think it’ s always good to talk to people and hear\nwhat ’s going on in their lives. What you find out is , they ’re you. They ’re just us. I mean,\nthey’ re, they’re —these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives,\nand they’ ve just , they’ve just found themselves in this place. It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem,\n\nthough. You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I ’m well aware th at this is not\nsomething that the F ed has all the tools for or anything like that. But I , I will do that when , when\nthe need arises and when , when it’ s not so much, you know, in the public eye.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. And is there anything specifically th at you would be\nlooking to learn there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not really. I mean, I , I think I know what I ’ll find there. I, I think\nyou, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is , they ’re like you.\nThat could be you. I mean, that could be your sister. That could be, you know, your kid. You ,\nyou always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and , you know, it just is a—it’s a —it’ s an\nimportant thing to engage in, I think. A nd I think, you know, we bring that understanding into\nour lives and , frankly , into our work—the work that we do as well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about digital currency. You previously said a\nfew times that you think it’ s important for th e U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right\nrather than be first. But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of , of moving too slow on, on digital currency.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I t hink the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to\nunderstand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well. Central bank digital\ncurrencies are now possible, and we’ re going to see some of them around the world. And we\nneed to understand whether that ’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we\nserve. How would it work in our system? And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we —and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the\ntechnology and the policy issues.\n\nI am—I would say this : We’re the world ’s reserve currency, and that means that the\ndollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency. And that ’s\nbecause of our rule of law ; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world ; our\neconomy; our industrious people ; all the things that make the United States the United States.\nThat’s why we ’re the , the reserve currency. And , of course, we have open capital accounts,\nwhich is essential if you ’re going to be the reserve currency. So those are the factors that make\nus the reserve currency.\nI am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital\ncurrency f irst. You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that , if you were a company\nthat’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use\nyour—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dol lars, where , where —\nwhich is what everyone does? And I ’m not so concerned about , about that. I am really\nconcerned about getting it right.\nIt is—it is a —it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we\nalready have, remember, a highly evolved payment system. We have F edNow and other\nimmediately available funds. Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in\nother parts of the world , which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments\nall the time. It’ll be normal. A nd what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in\nthat kind of an environment? Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that\nwe need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.\nI mean, that—what the China —the currency that ’s being used in China is not one that\nwould—that would work here. It ’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every\npayment that ’s used —for which it is used in real time. It’s much more to do with things that are\n\nhappening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global —you\nknow, sor t of global competition.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you another\nquestion about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations. A n umber of different\nsurveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation\nexpectations ratings. So I wonder ed, you know, if , if that was something that you saw consistent\nwith your inflation outlook. Is that something that worries you, or do you see that as, maybe,\nyou know, the success of the F ed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the , to\nthe broader public?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit —and here we\nthink of survey, market based —survey being eith er households or , or economists and , and\nmarket based. You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what\nwould have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation\ntarget, which calls f or 2 percent average inflation. So they’ re at the low end. Inflation\nexpectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ ve just\nmoved back up to levels broadly— that, that are where they were in 2018 , or in some cases 2014 ,\nand, I would say, more consistent with our mandate.\nAnd we want them to be —we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent\nbasis. We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been ru nning for the last quarter of a\ncentury. We want it to average 2 percent , not 1.7 percent . And for that, we need to see inflation\nexpectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent . We don’ t really see\nthat yet, but I would sa y that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way. Breakevens\n\nare based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re now at levels that are— that are pretty close to\nmandate consistent , whereas before, they were below. We monitor inflation expectation s very,\nvery carefully, as you would obviously know. So that’s where —that ’s where I would say it is.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Just o ne small follow -up. Do you have any redlines on inflation\nreadings where if, you know, you hit , like, a certain number on, say, you know, core PC E, that\nwould be, you know, a trigger response from the F ed?\nCHAIR POWELL. It doesn ’t work that way. You know, we ’re, we’re —inflation\nmeasures are always going to be a bit volatile. We expect —as I mentioned, we expect core and ,\nand head line PCE to move up because of base effects, and —you know, I —and we expect that to\ngo away. We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in. We don’ t know how\npersistent they ’ll be. We , we think they’ ll—you know, it ’s a matter of , of when they will pass\nthrough, not whether they will pass through. But we can ’t be confident about the exact timing of\nthat or the size of them. They don’ t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we , we\ndon’t know.\nI mean, you know, this is —this is all about the reopening of the economy. That ’s what ’s\nhappening. We had it —we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help\nfrom fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy , and, you know, a great deal of\nhelp from vaccination, we ’re seeing a strong rebound in activity. And what ’s happening is , it’s,\nit’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and —the saved -up fiscal transfers and , and\npeople going back to work and thin gs like that. The supply side will take a little bit of time to\nadapt. New restaurants will have to be opened. The supply of various inputs into the goods part\nof the economy will have to be brought back up to speed. And you—you’ re seeing some of that.\n\nThat’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters. You’ll see some of the bottlenecks\nresolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Brian Ch eung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Brian Ch eung with —hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Ch eung with\nYahoo Finance. I wanted to ask about financial stability , which is a part of the F ed’s reaction\nfunction here. It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they’ re\npaying attent ion to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin. And it seems like there ’s interesting\nreach for yield in this market— to some extent , also Archegos. So does the F ed see a relationship\nbetween low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the F ed’s perspective at this time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we look at —financial stability for us is really —we have a\nbroad framework, s o we don’ t just jump from one thing to another. I know many people just\nlook at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the —in the equity\nmarkets, which , which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets. But really , it—really, we try\nto stick to a framework for financial stability so we can —so we can talk about it the same way\neach time and so we can be held accountable for it.\nSo one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high. You\nare seeing , seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy. That ’s a fact.\nI won ’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to\ndo with vaccination and reopening of the economy. That ’s really what has been moving markets\na lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a f ast—a\nmuch faster vaccination process and a faster reopening. So that’s, that’s part of what’ s going on.\n\nThe othe r—the other things, though —you know, leverage in the financial system , is it —\nis, is not a problem. That ’s a— that’s a —that was one of the four pillars. Asset prices was one.\nLeverage in the financial system is, is not an issue ; we have very well capitalized large banks.\nWe have funding risks for , for our largest financial institutions that are also very low. We do\nhave some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’ re not systemic\nright now.\nAnd, and th e household sector is actually in pretty good shape. It was in —it was in a\nvery good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit.\nThere were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all\nof that , that the —that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically. That\nhasn’t happened. So, with the fiscal transfers, money that ’s on household balance sheets, they ’re\nin good shape. You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.\nSo the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it ’s—you know, it ’s\nmanageable, I would say . And it’s—by the way, I think it ’s appropriate and important for\nfinancial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity. Again, 8½ million\npeople who had jobs in February don’ t have them now, and, you know, there ’s a long way to go\nuntil we reach our goal. So that ’s what I would say.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. As a follow -up, you mentioned money market pressures . The Fed\ndidn’ t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves. What was the logic behind that?\nIt seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero. So just hoping for clarification on that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So the federal funds rate has been well within target and —at\ntarget range, and money market funds —money market conditions are , are fine. We have the\nability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case. We do expect\n\nfurther downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the —in the\nTreasury G eneral A ccount. But , at this point, we didn’ t see a need for —to, to deploy our tools\nto, to support rate s. And , of course, we will do so if , if the need does arise.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a , a similar question. We are seeing\nelevated market valuations , and some economists are concerned that the economy might\noverheat, at least for a period of time. So should the F ed and other regulators be thinking about\ntightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risk s stay as low as they have been? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me —went up\ntremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic. And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed\nthree , three of our —two of our stress tests, and that is another one that ’s pending. So capital is,\nis in a good place , as far as I ’m concerned, in the banking system.\nBut, to your point , what we saw was—so what , what kind of happened during the\npandemic crisis that , that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and\ncorporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to —we ’re, we’re looking\nat that. So we ’re looking at ways , and people around the world are looking at ways , to make\nthose vehicles resilient so that they don ’t have to be, you know, supported by the government\nwhenever there’ s, you know, severely stressed market conditions. It’ s a private business. They ,\nthey need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the F ed and others\nto—around the world to come in. So that was that.\n\nThe other one is T reasur y market structure. Dealers are committing less capital to that\nactivity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there ’s\nso much more supply of Treasuries. And so there are some questions about T reasur y market\nstructure, and there ’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there ’s something we\ncan do about this , because we—you know, the U.S. T reasury market is probably the most single\nimportant —single most important market in , in the economy and the world. It needs to be\nliquid. It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.\nSo it’s not clear what , what —where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful\nlook—and the T reasury Department is , is really going to be leading this —at, at Treasury market\nstructure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong\nTreasury market that can work even in difficult times. As , as you know, at the very beginning of\nthe financial —of the —of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling T reasuries,\nincluding by foreign central banks, that , really , the dealers couldn ’t handle the volume. And so\nwhat was happening was , the ma rket was really starting to lose function, and that’s —that was a\nreally serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases. And, you\nknow, so we ’d like to , we’d like to see if there isn ’t something we can do to—is —do we need to\nbuild against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, F ed Chairman , for the question. So I’m interested\nin your thoughts. There ’s so much fiscal he lp and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.\nYou said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or , or lead to more\nnormal economic conditions later this year. When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak ? And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the\n\naccommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be\ninjected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation —nature of the inflation?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. When will the economy be , be able to stand on its own feet? I’m not\nsure if —I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. What , what I’m saying is, is, you know, when will the —when\nwill you need to lower the , the amount of T reasuries you ’re buying to sort of taper off a little bit?\nWhen can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side? And then—and then, further, the transitory.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. Sorry. So we have —you know, we ’ve articulated our test for\nthat, as you know, and that is just , we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see\nsubstantial further progress. And we ’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any\ndecision. W e’re going to let, you know, the , the public know that that ’s what we’ re thinking.\nAnd, and so there ’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing. But it’ s about substantial further\nprogress toward our goals. That ’s, that’s really all it is. It doesn ’t have any , any external, virus -\nrelated specific requirement , although, again, I do think it ’ll—you know, the , the virus will need\nto continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals. But it’ s really the\neconomic goals.\nNow, your second question. Sorry , just say again. I didn’ t quite get th at question.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes, sure. With all the fiscal spending that’ s happened and\nthe accommodation and —does , does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side\nor accommodation , or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put\nthose upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s really up to Congress. We—we ’re not an advis er to\nCongress. You know, we don’ t, we don’t weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals. That ’s\nreally between elected parties. You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who\nstand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions , and\nthey get to be accountable to the voters. We didn ’t do any of that, and we don’ t have a seat at\nthat table. We don’ t seek a seat at that table. So that ’s really something for Congress and the\nAdministration to , to deal with.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Thank you—thank you so much for\nthe—for the opportunity. I wanted to circle back to the housing market. I t’s just kind of\nconfusing that the question and your answer —you know, the housing market is strong, prices are\nup. And yet the F ed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage -related assets. Why is that,\nand are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. I, I mean, we ’re—we started buying MBS becaus e the\nmortgage -backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we ’ve\nsort of , sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that. It ’s not meant to provide\ndirect assistance to , to the housing market. That was never the intent. It was really just to keep\nthat as —it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.\nAnd so that ’s, that’s why we , we bought as we did during the Global F inancial C risis; we bought\nMBS too. Again, not , not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was , which was\nreally not , not a problem this time at all. So —and, you know, it ’s, it’s a situation where we will,\nwe will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those , those purchases will\ncome to zero over time. And that time is not yet.\n\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. A nd for the last question, we ’ll go to Mike McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I a m last, let me go back to\nPaul’s question, the first question, and ask him —ask you whether —not whether you ’re thinking\nabout thinking of tapering , but why you’ re not. We’re seeing bank lending fall. The markets\nseem to be operating well. Are you afraid of a taper tantrum? O r is it, as one money manager\nput it, “If you get out of the markets, there aren ’t enough buyers for all of the T reasury debt , and\nso rates would have to go way up”? The b ottom -line question is , what do we get for $ 120 billion\na month that we couldn’ t get for less?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s really not more complicated than this. We, we articulated the\n“substantial further progress ” test at our December meeting . And, really , for the next couple of\nmonths, we made relatively little progress toward our goals. And, remember, substantial further\nprogress from December —from our December meeting. And then vaccination started to get\nmore widespread. The economy reopened. We got a really nice job report for March. It doesn ’t\nconstitute substantial further progress. It’s not close to substantial further progress.\nWe’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal . And we believe we\nwill; it just is a question of when. And so, when that time —when the time comes for us to talk\nabout talking about it, we ’ll do that. And—but that time is not now. It’ s—we ’re just not —we ’re\nnot that f ar. We’ ve had one great jobs report. It ’s not enough. You know, we ’re going to act on\nactual data, not on our forecast . And we ’re just going to need to see more data. That’s —it’s no,\nno more complicated than that.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, i f you leave rates where they are, it doesn’ t change anything.\nBut does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit ? If you spent less , would you still get\nthe same effect on the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. If we bought less? You ’re, you’re very faint. So if someone has the\nvolume, they can turn it up. But if we bought less, you know, no. I mean, I think the effect is\nproportional to the amount we buy. It ’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial\nconditions. We, we have tri ed to create accommodative financial conditions to support\neconomic activity, and we did that.\nAnd we articulated the —you know, the , the tests for withdrawing that accommodation.\nAnd we think, you know —so we ’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled b oth for asset\npurchases and for liftoff of rates. And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we ’ll, we’ll go\nahead . As we—you know, we ’ve done this before. We did it in , in the last —after the last crisis,\nand, you know, we ’ll do it in , in maybe —we ’ll do i t—as those tests are satisfied , we’ll do it.\nAnd the —and the only thing that will guide us is , are the tests met? You know, that, that ’s what\nwe focused on: I s—have , have the macroeconomic conditions that we’ ve articulated, have they\nbeen realized? That will be the test for , for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. Take care.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you."
