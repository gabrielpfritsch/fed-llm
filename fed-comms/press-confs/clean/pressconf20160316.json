  "text": "March 16, 2016\n\nCHAIR YELLEN . Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided\nto maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. Our decision to keep\nthis accommodative policy stance reflects both our assessment of the economic outlook and the risks associated with that outlook. The Committee ’s baseline expectations for economic activity,\nthe labor market, and inflation have not changed much since December: With appropriate monetary policy , we continue to expect moderate economic growth, further labor market\nimprovement, and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective in two to three years. However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks. Against this backdrop, the\nCommittee judged it prudent to maintain the current policy stance at today ’s meeting. I will\ncome back to our policy decision momentarily, but first let me review recent economic\ndevelopments and the outlook.\nThe labor market continues to strengthen. Over the most recent three months, job gains\naveraged nearly 230,000 per month, similar to the pace experienced over the past year. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in the f irst two months of the year, about in line with the\nmedian of FOMC participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level. A broader measure of\nunemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recent ly and people who are working part time but would rather work full time\nhas continued to improve. Of note, the labor force participation rate has turned up noticeably since the fall, with more people working or actively looking for work as the prospects f or finding\njobs have improved. But there is still room for improvement: Involuntary part -time employment\nremains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup.\n\nThe improvement in employment conditions so far this year has occurred as economic\ngrowth appears to have picked up from the modest pace seen in the fourth quarter of last year.\nHousehold spending is expanding at a moderate rate, supported by continued job gains and increases in inflation -adjusted incomes . In contrast, bus iness investment has been weak, in part\nreflecting further reductions in oil drilling as a result of low oil prices. Net exports also remain soft as a consequence of subdued foreign growth and the earlier appreciation of the dollar. Looking ahead, the Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\nOngoing economic growth and additional strengthening in l abor market conditions are\nimportant factors underpinning the inflation outlook. Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures —stepped up to 1¼ percent\nover the 12 months ending in January, as the sh arp decline in energy prices around the end of\n2014 dropped out of the year -over-year figures. Core inflation , which excludes energy and food\nprices , has also picked up, although it remains to be seen if this firming will be sustained. In\nparticular, the earlier declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar could well continue\nto weigh on overall consumer prices. But once these transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years.\nThe Committee ’s inflation outlook rests importantly on its judgment that longer -run\ninflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. However, the stability of longer -run\ninflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. Survey -based measures of longer -run\ninflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months , although some remain\n\nnear historically low levels. Market -based measures of inflation compensation also remain low.\nMovements in these indicators reflect many factors and therefore may not provide an accurate\nreading on changes in the inflation expectations that are most relevant for wage and price setting. Nonetheless, our statement continues to emphasize that, in considering fut ure policy decisions,\nwe will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.\nThis general assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections\nsubmitted for this meeting by FOMC participants. As always, each participant ’s projections are\nconditioned on his or own —his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn,\ndepends on each person’ s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook.\nParticipants ’ projections for growth of inflation- adjusted gross domestic product or GDP are just\na touch lower than the projections made in conjunction with the December FOMC meeting. The median growth projection edges down from 2.2 percent this year to 2 percent in 2018, in line\nwith its estimated longer -run rate. The median projection for the unemployment rate falls from\n4.7 at the end of this year to 4.5 percent at the end of 2018, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer -run normal unemployment rate. T he median path of the unemployment\nrate is a little lower than in December, in part reflecting a slightly lower median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate. Finally, with the transitory factors holding down\ninflation expected to abate and l abor market conditions anticipated to strengthen further, the\nmedian inflation projection rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018. The median inflation projection for this year is a little lower than in December, but thereafter the median projections are unchanged.\nSince the turn of the year, concerns about global economic prospects have led to\nincreased financial market volatility and somewhat tighter financial conditions in the United\n\nStates, although financial con ditions have improved notably more recently. In addition,\neconomic growth abroad appears to be running at a somewhat softer pace than previously\nexpected. These unanticipated developments, however, have not resulted in material changes to the Committee ’s baseline outlook. One reason for this is that market expectations for the path of\npolicy interest rates have moved down, and the accompanying decline in longer -term interest\nrates should help cushion any possible adverse effects on domestic economic acti vity. Indeed,\nwhile stock prices have fallen slightly since the December meeting and spreads of investment -\ngrade corporate bond yields over those on comparable -maturity Treasury securities have risen,\nmortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs have move d lower. Of course, the Committee will\ncontinue to monitor these developments closely and will adjust the stance of monetary policy as needed to foster our goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\nReturning to monetary policy, as I noted earli er, the Committee decided to maintain its\ntarget range for the federal funds rate. This decision partly reflects the implications for the U.S. economy of the global economic and financial developments I just mentioned. In addition, proceeding cautiously in removing policy accommodation at this time will allow us to verify that\nthe labor market is continuing to strengthen despite the risks from abroad. Such caution is appropriate given that short -term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary\npolicy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook.\nAs we indicated in our statement, “ the Committee expects that economic conditions will\nevolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate ; the federal\nfunds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds\nrate—defined as the value of the fed eral funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor\n\ncontractionary if the economy was operating near potential —is currently low by historical\nstandards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral federal\nfunds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that weigh on aggregate demand, including developments abroad, a subdued pace of household formation, and meager productivity growth. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the evolution of the neutral funds rate over time. However, if these headwinds abate, as we expect, the neutral federal funds rate should gradually move higher as well.\nThis view is implicitly reflected in participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary\npolicy. The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 0.9 percent late\nthis year and 1.9 percent next year. As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by t he end of 2018, close to its longer -\nrun normal level. Compared with the projections made in December, the median path is about\n½ percentage point lower this year and next; the median longer -run normal federal funds rate has\nbeen revised down as well. In other words, most Committee participants now expect that achieving economic outcomes similar to those anticipated in December will likely require a somewhat lower path for policy interest rates than foreseen at that time.\nI would like to underscore, howe ver, that the participants ’ projections for the federal\nfunds rate, including the median path, are not a “plan” for future policy. Policy is not on a preset course. These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of what appropriate policy\nwould be given each person’ s own current projections of the most likely outcomes for economic\ngrowth, employment, inflation, and other factors. However, considerable uncertainty attaches to each participant ’s forecasts of economic outcomes. Hence, their assessments of appropriate\n\npolicy are also uncertain and will change in response to adjustments to the economic outlook and\nassociated risks, as was the case between December and now.\nAlso, it is important to note that the Committee makes its decisions on a meeting -by-\nmeeting basis and does not and need not decide on a likely future path for the federal funds rate. Indeed, the future path of policy is necessarily uncertain because the economy will surely evolve in unexpected ways. As we note in our state ment, “ the actual path of the federal funds rate will\ndepend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.”\nFinally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments from agen cy debt and mortgage -backed securities.\nAs highlighted in our policy statement, we anticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization\nof the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.” Maintaining our sizable holdings of\nlonger -term securitie s should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should\nreduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock.\nThank you, and I ’ll be happy to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMA N. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Madam Chair, as you know, inflation has\ngone up the last two months. We had another strong jobs report, the tracking forecast s for GDP\nhave returned to 2 percent, and yet the Fed stands pat while it ’s in a process of what it said it\nlaunched in December was a “ process of normalization.” So I have two questions about this :\nDoes the F ed have a credibility problem , in the sense that it says it will do some —one thing\nunder certain conditions but doesn’ t end up doing it ? And then, frankly, if the current conditions\nare no t sufficient for the F ed to raise rates, well, what would those conditions ever look like?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, let me start—let me start with the question of the F ed’s\ncredibility , and you used the word “ promises ” in connection with that. And , as I tried to\nemphasize in my opening statement, the paths that the participants project for the federal funds\nrate and how it will evolve are not a preset plan or commitment or promise of the C ommittee.\nIndeed, they are not even —the median should not be interpreted as a C ommittee -endorsed\nforecast , and there ’s a lot of uncertainty around each participant ’s projection. And they will\nevolve —those assessments of appropriate policy are completely contingent on each participant ’s\nforecast of the economy and how economic events will unfold. And they are, of course, uncertain , and you should fully expect that forecast s for the appropriate path of policy on the part\nof all participants will evolve over time as shocks, positive or negative, hit the economy that alter those forecasts. So you have seen a shift this time in most participants ’ assessments of the\nappropriate path for policy , and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat\nslower projected path for global growth —for growth in the global economy outside the United\nStates —and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads. And\nthose changes in financial conditions and in the path of the global economy have induced changes in the assessment of individual participants in what path is appropriate to achieve our objectives. So that ’s what you see. That ’s what you see.\nNow, I guess you asked me also what would we need to see to continue raising rates , and\nI think it ’s worth pointing out here that the Committee —most participants do continue to\nenvision that if economic developments unfold as they expect , that further increases i n the\nfederal funds rate will prove appropriate over time . Most participants anticipate that, a nd that the\npace will be gradual. As I emphasized, most empirical work attempting to assess what the equilibrium level of the fed funds rate is , a level that w ould be neither expansionary nor\n\ncontractionary is—those assessments are quite low at this time. So there is accommodation in\nthe stance of policy , and we do expect , over time , that neutral rate to move up, but, you know,\nwe’re not positive what rate —what the pace of change of that will be over time. But , given that\nthe economy is now close to our maximum employment objective, you know, hopefully inflation\nis moving up— I mentioned, as you mentioned, recent readings on inflation have moved up.\nThere may be some— you know, I want to warn that there may be some transitory factors that are\ninfluencing that. But , certainly, our projections are for a gradual increase in inflation, a nd the\nCommittee —at least , most participants continue to expect that if we follow along this course ,\nthat some further adjustments in the federal funds rate will be a ppropriate but gradual.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . Can I just follow up on this\ninflation point ? Because the numbers have been t icking up, as you said —somewhat , at least.\nAnd we ’re also , as you said , also at a point where we have quite close to full employment. Is\nthere a risk that we’ re heading for an overshoot in inflation, and is there, given the greater\nsymmetry the F ed has been flaggi ng up , in terms of its inflation target, a greater tolerance for a\nmodest overshoot , especially given the long period of undershoots that we ’ve been through?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I want to make clear th at our inflation objective is 2 percent , and\nwe are proj ecting a move back to 2 percent . And we are not trying to engineer an overshoot of\ninflation, not to compensate for past undershoots, so 2 percent is our objective. But it is a symmetric objective , and we certainly don ’t seek to overshoot our objective. But some\nundershoots and overshoots are part of how the economy operates , and our tolerance for those is\nsymmetric with respect to under - and overshoots. We did take note in the statement of the fact\nthat inflation ha s picked up in recent months. I see some of that a s having to do with unusually\nhigh inflation readings in categories that tend to be quite volatile without very much significance\n\nfor inflation over time. So I ’m wary and haven ’t yet concluded that we have seen any significant\nuptick t hat will be lasting in , for example, in co re inflation. But we note —the C ommittee notes ,\nas it did in December , that we continue to monitor development trends and developments\nclosely , and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high\nside, and, as I mentioned , on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation\nand some survey measures have been on the low side. So , in that sense, there are risks around\nthe inflation forecast in both—in both dire ctions.\nLINDSAY DUNSMUIR. Hi , Lindsay Dunsmuir with Reuters. Your statement did note\nthat, as you ’re saying , that inflation has picked up in recent months , and you do still see it going\nback to 2 percent over the medium term. Y et policymakers have downgraded GDP growth\nforecast s for this year and one of the inflation measures. So that to me would indicate a\nweakening economic environment , and I’m wondering how , in that environment , you justify the\npossibility of two rate hikes this year.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So there has been a slight downgrading of the assessment of\neconomic growth for this year. But, nevertheless, growth is expected to run in—somewhat i n\nexcess of potential, so that the labor market is expected to continue to tighten, a nd by the end of\nthe year, even edge below levels that —of the unemployment rate —that are estimated to be\nlonger in the normal run, and inflation is expec ted to gradually move back to 2 percent over time.\nWe still have, weighing on inflation, the influence of earlier declines in energy prices and a\nprolonged effect from the appreciation of the dollar , but we do expect those transitory influences\nto fade. And with a continuing —continuing improvement in the labor market, I think we ’ll see\nupward pressure on infla tion. And , in that context, the C ommittee sees it ap propriate to—if\nthings unfold in that way , to have some further incr eases in the federal funds rate. It remains\n\naccommodative. A s I indicated in December —the C ommittee indicated in December, we want\ninflation to go ba ck to 2 percent . But we also want to be careful not to see some significant\novershoots , so that we would get behind the curve and potentially be faced with a need to tighten\nin a very rapid fashion later in a way that could undermine the sustainability of the employment\ngains we have had. But we do see some continued tightening in monetary policy to be\nappropriate in that event.\nPETER BARNES. Chair Yellen, over here. Hi, Peter Barnes with F ox Business. Could\nyou get a little bit more specific about the global and economic financial developments that\ncontinue to pose risks to the U .S. economy? You did mention a strong dollar there just a second\nago and slowing global growth. But are you specifically concerned about , for example, China,\nthe emerging markets , and the E .U.? Could you expand on the risks?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So there has been , by many forecasters , a slight downgrading of\nforecast s of global growth in—over the coming several years. The IMF has slightly downgraded\ntheir forecast s, and other international agencies have as well. Chinese growth has n’t proven a\ngreat surprise. We ’ve anticipated that it would slow over time , and it seems to be slowing as\nwell. Japanese growth in the fourth quarter was negative , and that was something of a surprise.\nAnd with respect to the euro area, recent indicators suggest perhaps slightly weaker growth. So\nthere’ s been a number of emerging markets —as you know, we ’re suffering under the weight of\ndeclines in oil prices that a re affecting their economic activity. Our neighbors both to the north\nand south, Canada and Mexico, are feeling the impacts of lower oil prices on their growth. So\nour projection for global growth, for those reasons , is slightly lower —not dramatically lo wer, but\nenough lower to make some difference to our forecast . And , as I indicated, I think that ’s part of\nthe reason, along with the associated increase we have seen in some spreads that are involved\n\nin—enter into corporate borrowing rates, and can affect investment decisions . It’s a reason to\nthink that a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate will be appropriate to achieve our\nobjectives. And so what you see here is a virtually unchanged path of economic projections and\na slightly more ac commodative path that most participants are writing down for what’ s necessary\nto achieve that.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Thank you. Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal . Madam\nChair, you ’ve emphasized repeatedly that every meeting of the FOMC is a live meeting. You\nhave a meeting next month. Is it possible that you could get enough information between now\nand then to, you know, get you comfortable with raising rates again in April , and w hat would\nyou need to see?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I will say again that every meeting is a live meeting. April\nremains a live meeting , and we will be tracking incoming data. It’s a slightly shorter period. We\nhave six weeks , but there will be additional data on the labor market and on various factors that\npertain to inflation . So that ’s, you know, that ’s—that is certainly a l ive possibility.\nSTEVEN MUFSON. Two questi ons. The oil —lower oil prices . I think a lot of people\nexpect it to lead to more consumer spending. What do you—how do you see and how do you\nexplain that that hasn ’t worked out as well —the way a lot of people expect ed? And also, if oil\nprices were to pop back up to, say , $50, not that high by some standards, what impact would that\nhave on inflation? And w ould you be paying more attention to the overall inflation rate? Or\nwould you then look to the cor e rate to —to—to determine what the Fed ’s policies would be?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer s pending. I\nhave to say , it’s very difficult when you look a t patterns of consumer spending to—t here are\nmany factors that influence it , and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted\n\nconsumer spending, I ’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any —in any rigorous\nway. The typical —the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are\nnow is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year. And some very detailed microdata that I ’ve\nseen on household spending patte rns suggest that there may be a link , as you would expect , from\nreduced bill s—you know, reduced amounts that people pay at the pump to other spending , like\neating out at—for restaurant meals and other things. But the aggregate data, I—you know, is not\nas strong as it —and spending is not as strong as it could be, given the decline. And , of cour se,\non the other side, we are —and , you know, it may be that it will take a while , and it ’s something\nthat w ill slowly strengthen ove r time if oil prices stay low . On the other side , of course, we have\nseen a marked decline in drilling activity , which ha s depressed investment spending , and, of\ncourse , very substantial layoffs in the energy sector.\nWith respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up,\nthe C ommittee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices , whether they were\non the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence.\nAnd w hen I say that, what I mean is that if o il prices move up during the time that it’ s moving\nup, it raises inflation. But they don’ t need to move down again to their previous levels for that\ninfluence to disappear , they only need to stabilize at a higher level. And , similarly, oil prices\nhave obviously moved down a great deal over the last year , and we ’re not expecting them to\nmove back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level. They ’re obviously volatile , but,\nas they stabilize, the influence w ill move out of both headline —of headline inflation. And that ’s\nwhat you see in the forecasts of participants. So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly\n\nwe would move back to 2 percent , but I wouldn’ t think that that would be something alone that\nwould have great policy significance.\nMART IN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger , Associated Press. You said in—t he policy\nstatement in December said that the risk s to the outlook were “ balanced ,” and you raised rates.\nThat phrasing disappeared then in January and March. Co uld you talk a little bit about—but in\nyour comments today, you seem to be indicating that not that much has changed. Could you\nhelp us understand what needs to happen to get bac k to “ balanced ,” and is that the language we\nneed to look for to see the next rate hike?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me say that, in recent weeks, I think the C ommittee certainly\nthinks that risks to the outlook have diminished. Nevertheless, we continue to see risks , which\nwe highlighted. Now, I would point out that we decided not to describe the balance of risks as\nweighted to the downside. So the C ommittee did not reach that judgment, and there is no\ncollective judgment in this statement on whether the r isks are balanced or not. My —we declined\nto make a collective assessment. You know, my guess is that some participants see them as balanced , and some see them as weighted somewhat to the downside.\nBut I think it is important to note a couple of things. First of all, the U .S. economy has\nbeen very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks , and we highlighted that right at the\nbeginning of our statement , where we said that “ economic activity has been expanding at a\nmoderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months .” And\nthat—that is important, that the U .S. economy continues to do well. Second, I would say that\nwhile global developments do pose some downside risks, the risks are not all one sided . A\nnumber of countries —including China, the e uro area , the Bank of Japan —have taken measures\nto stimulate the economy , so there is also upside risk to the economic outlook. And , in addition,\n\noil prices have rebounded from their lows , and that eases concerns about the fi nancial condition\nof some energy firms and the stresses facing some oil -producing economies. And , at the same\ntime, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power. So there are risks . We’re\nattentive to them. We have not described them as unbalanced to the out —to the downside , and\nthey are two sided . One can identify both upside and downside risks t here.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times . Wage growth thus far\nhas been disappointing. It’s been very uneven. It was disappointing , figures in last month ’s jobs\nreport. Why do you think that is , and how important is sustained wage growth to removing your\nwariness on inflation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I must say I ’m—I do see broad -based improvement in the labor\nmarket , and I’m somewhat surprised that we ’re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth. But\nat least —and I have to say , in anecdotal reports, we do hear quite a number of reports of firms\nfacing wage pressures and even broad -based, slightly faster increases in wages —wage increases\nthat they ’re granting. But in the aggregate data, one doesn ’t yet see any convincing evidence of\na pickup in wage growth. It’s mainly isolated to certain sectors and occupations. So I do think,\nconsistent with the 2 percent inflation objec tive, that there is certainly scope for further increases\nin wages. The fact that we have not seen any broad -based pickup is one of the factors that\nsuggest s to me that there is continued slack in the labor market , but I would expect wage growth\nto move up some.\nPATRICK GILLESPIE. Patrick Gillespie with CNNMoney. Chair Yellen, numerous\npolls show —by CNN and others —show that the U .S. economy is American voters ’ number one\nconcern right now . There’ s a lot of negative sentiment about the economy , yet unem ployment is\nlow, job gains have been pretty good for the past year, a nd consumer confidence has picked up.\n\nWhy do you think there is such disparity between the progress —between the economy and its\nprogress and how voters feel? And my second question is , how does a ny negative sentiment\nabout the economy factor into your economic outlook and the decisions you make on monetary\npolicy? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Let me start with your second question, if I might. So in trying to\njudge the outlook for the economy, we do look at measures pe rtaining to consumer sentiment,\nand they a re in solid territory. Household balance sheets are much improved. Gains in inflation -\nadjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace. As I mentioned, households have bene fited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do\nreflect —do reflect that. So they are not at low level s. And , really , the labor market, I think, has\nimproved a great deal . And every demographic group that, you know , we track regularly has\nseen improvement in their labor market situation —perhaps not all equally , but almost all\ndemographic groups have seen improvement. So I —I think it ’s right to say the economy is\nimproving , and most groups are seeing benefits.\nThat said, we know that inequality has been rising in the United States over many years,\nnot just the last several but going back to the mid- ’80s. There has been downwa rd pressure on\nreal wage groups —on real wage gains for groups , particularly those that are l ess skilled and\neducated, and those longer -term trends that may be assoc iated with a number of factors —\ntechnol ogical change and globalization —have been a concern for many, many years, a nd that\nmay be part of what you’ re—we ’re seein g expressed.\nCHRIS TOPHER CONDON. Thank you, right here . Chair Yellen, there seems to be\nsome growing sentiment that even if the direct economic tie s between the U .S. and other\neconomies i s still relatively modest, that the impact through financial markets and exchange rates\n\nhas become more robust. And because of that, it ’s becoming more difficult or will become more\ndifficult for the F ed to diverge from other major central banks with its benchmark interest rate.\nWould you generally agree with that sentiment? Why or why no t?\nAnd, very briefly, second , if I may —in your mind, does it undermine in any way the\nstanding of the Federal Reserve as a nonpartisan institution when one of its sitting G overnors\ncontributes to the campaign of a national political figure? Thank you.\nCHAIR YE LLEN. So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates. We\nhave global capital markets. In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary\npolicy actions in any country have e ffects —spillovers to other countries. T hat’s true of our\nmonetary policy, and it ’s true of other countries ’ monetary policies. In part, that shows up\nthrough movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs\nto take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stanc e of monetary policy. So the fact\nthat there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.\nBut it does not mean that monetary —U.S. monetary policy is somehow constrained in a\nway that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad. There are\nmany periods when monetary policies in different countries have moved in different directions ,\nand, you know, the United States has been growing more strongly and had better success in the\nlabor market than many other advanced countries. And , at this point, it’ s natural that there\nshould be some divergence in our monetary policies. Movements in exchange rates partly reflect\nthat.\nSo I wouldn’ t want to endorse the notion if, you know —that you ’re suggesting , that our\npolicy is in some way crippled by the fact that there are these interlinkages . That’s simply how\nthe glo bal financial system works. We —this is one reason we meet —meet frequently with other\n\neconomic policymakers in other countries, exchange notes about how we see economic\ndevelopments evolve, and try to keep one another apprised of economic developments and likely\npolicy responses.\nYour second question concerned the political contributions. So I want to start by saying\nthat I ’ve been involved for many years in the Federal Reserve System, and we are a non partisan ,\nindependent institution devoted to pursuing our congr essionally mandated objectives, and I have\nnever seen political views in any way influence the policy judgments th at are made inside the\nFederal Reserve. I want to say that emphatically.\nThe political activities of G overnors, participants, government employees are governed\nby the Hatch Act. We are all subject to that, and the Hatch Act does allow campaign contribut ions to be made. It outlaws other forms of partisan activity. And I would say, w ithin\nthat, so it is each —it’ s up to each individual to decide what is appropriate , in their point of view.\nBut the Federal Reserve is not —is not a partisan political organization.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . The policy, the\nprojections —the new economic projections appear to reflect an increase in your estimate of the\nextent of labor market slack. You talked about one possible reason for that , which is the softness\nof wage growth. Are there other considerations that have led you to increase your estimate of how much slack there is in the labor market?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I should point out that I think what you ’re talking about is the\nslight decline in the median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate. Is that —is\nthat what you ’re—\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. That, and the slope of the path of rate increases combined\nwith projections of relatively low inflation.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest\ndecline in estimates of the longer -run normal unemployment rate. That, I would say , reflects, for\nthose who brought it down, an estimate of greater slack in the labor market. The f ed funds r ate\nprojection is not just that . It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in other views about , for\nexample, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve\nour objectives. But the slow pace of wage growth, the fact that part -time employment for\neconomic reasons and voluntary part -time employment remains high —we have seen an upward\nmove in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the la bor market. My guess is that those things influence d individuals\nwho wrote down a sligh tly lower number for the longer -run un employment rate.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace. We ’ve\nheard a lot of talk today about President Obama’ s pick for the Supreme Court , but there are a\nnumber of vacancies on the Fed Board of Governors , and there ’s a new position, the V ice\nChair[man] for S upervision, that the P resident hasn ’t even nominated anyone for. Would you\nlike the P resident to nom inate someone for that position, a nd what effect are those vacancies\nhaving on the F ed?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think Congress intended for the Federal Reserve Board to\nhave seven members, a nd that tends to bring on board people with a wide spectrum of views and\nexperience and perspectives. I think that ’s valuable, and I would like to see the Senate move\nforward and consider these nominees so that we could operate with a full complement .\nWith respect to the nomination for V ice C hair[man] [for] Supervision, t hat’s a question\nthat I think you need to pose to the White House. I, you know, would say that we are doing a\n\nvery good job on supervision, and, you know, we are very focused on and devote a great deal of\ntime to that issue. So , real ly, it’s—the nomi nation question is one for the White House.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Thank you, Madam Chair. John Helt man with American Banker .\nThe P resident last week expressed concern about what he termed “cynicism” on both sides of the\naisle concerning progress made since the crisis to reform the banking sector and the financial\nsector more generally. Do you share that concern about , kind of , public attitudes that either not\nenough has been done or what has been done has not been effective in changing the regulatory landscape in banking ? Just what are your thoughts?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I feel a great deal has been done. We have been working at this\nfor a number of years , and I believe we have made very substantial progress. We have a—much\nmore capital, higher -quality capital, liquidity in the bankin g system. Our supervision has —we\nhave mad e very meaningful changes for —in our supervision, for example. The stress tests—the\nstress- test methodology that we use routinely to evaluate the robustness of the capital positions\nand plans of the largest institutions constitutes a quantum leap in terms of, I think, the quality of the supervision we are providing , especially of the largest firms. So we have finished writing\nmost of the Dodd- Frank rules . We are working very hard on “ too big to f ail,” which is of grave\nconcern to the American people.\nIn addition to having a financial system that is more robust and less likely to experience a\nfailure, we ha ve also worked very hard, continue to work on making sure we have the ability to\nresolve a firm i f it were to fail in spite —in spite of having more capital and liquidity. And there,\ntoo, I think, we have made very substantial progress.\nA month or so ago, we came out with a r ule—so -called TLAC rule—that would require\nthe largest firms to hold a substantia l buffer of long -term debt that, in the event that they were to\n\nfail, could be bailed in to protect the taxpayer from having to bear any burden in terms of\ninjecting capital into the firms —it would provide loss absorption in that event. And working\njointly, closely with the FDIC, firms have made a great deal of p rogress with their living wills.\nWe’re in the process of evaluating the most recent submissions. And working with the FDIC, I\nthink, potential techniques that could be used in the event of a failure of a significant financial institution, we have also made a lot of progress there.\nI think I was at the meeting of financial regulators with the P resid ent when he made t hose\ncomments, and I understood that what he was trying to tell the American people , that they should\nunderstand there really has been very substantial progress, and that ’s something they should be\naware of.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Can I follow up, just real quick? Sorry . But do you think that ,\ndespite all that progress , that there—why hasn ’t that message —why hasn ’t—why haven ’t these\nimprovements made its way to the public? And perhaps, like, do you find that that is an obstacle either among people that you meet, people in the public , or the representatives in Congress that\nmaybe have this pervasive view that nothing has changed? Is that an obstacle? Is that a problem?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think —I think it ’s our job as we make these improvements to\nexplain wha t we’re doing and to try to educate t he public about what ’s happened, a nd they may\nnot understand how much has changed. It’s certainly part of my own responsibility to try to\nexplain that to the American people.\nKAREN MRACEK. Karen Mracek with Market News International . In the SEP today,\nthe unemployment rate forecast for future years —for 2017, 2018—was marked dow n without\nchanges to inflation, a nd there seems to be a growing debate about the relationship between\n\nhigher —lower unemployment and higher i nflation. What is your view about the strength of this\nrelationship, the Phillips curve , and how does that view weigh in to just how much actual\ninflation versus anticipation —anticipated inflation you ’ll need to see?\nCHAIR YELLEN. O kay, so t hat was a com plicated question, and there —let me start\nwith the Phillips curve. So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the\ndegree of slack in the labor market and inflation, a nd it is an empirical relationship that, while\nnot absolutely tigh t, has been a con sistent relationship over time, a nd I believe that relationship\nstill holds. But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be\noverstated. The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on i nflation , so we shouldn’ t\noverblow how large that is.\nIn addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an\nimportant driver of actual wage- and pri ce-setting decisions and inflation behavior, a nd I believe\nthere’ s also solid empirical evidence for that. And it ’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my\nstatement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement , that we are tracking indicators\nof the inflation expectation s that matter to wage and price setting .\nNow, unfortunately, we don’ t have perfect measures of these things. We have survey\nmeasures. We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer -\nterm inflation —at longer -term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in\nprices that they see every day . In part icular, when gas prices go down, which is very noticeable\nto most households, you tend to see a view —you tend to see responses about long -term inflation\nmarked d own. So that ’s kind of an over response to something that ’s transitory. So it ’s difficult\nto get a clear read from those survey measures.\n\nInflation compensation a s measured in financial markets also embo dies a variety of risk\npremia and liquidity premia. And so, it ’s also —we monitor those closely and discuss them in the\nstatement in paragra ph one , but, again, there ’s not a straight read on what ’s happening to the\nexpectation s that influence wage and pric e setting. But this model continues to at least influence\nmy own thinking , and it certainly is a factor that I and at least some of my colleagues are\nincorporating in these projections.\nERIK SCHATZKER. Eri k Schatzker, Bloomberg Television. Madam Chair, thank y ou.\nNotwithstanding what the dot s tell us about rate expectations, has there been any d iscussion\namong members of the C ommittee about the potential need for further stimulus? And even if\nthere hasn ’t been such a discussion yet, could you share wit h us what you have learned from the\nreevaluation of negative interest rates, whether you consider negative interest rates effective,\nhow effective relative to quanti tative easing, and whether the C ommittee would hyp othetically\nuse them instead of or in conju nction with quantitative easing in the event that the economy\nshould warrant further stimulus?\nCHAIR YELLEN. O kay. So what I would like to make clear is that this is not actively a\nsubject that we are considering or discussing. The C ommittee continues to feel that we are on a\ncourse where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up. And, as I indicated, if events continue to unfold in that way, we are likely to gradually raise rates over time. Again, that’s not fixed in stone. We’ll watch how the economy behaves. We ’re prepared to respond if\nthings transpire differently , but we are not spending time actively debating and considering\nthings we could do for additional accommodation and certainly not actively considering negative rates. We are looking at th e experience in other countries, and I guess I would judge they seem\nto have mixed effects, you know, some positive and some negative things.\n\nBut, look, if we found ourselves in the unlikely situation where we needed to add\naccommodation , we have a range of tools . And we know from the things we did in the past that\nwe have a number of options with respect to the maturity, for example, of our portfolio, with\nrespect to asset purchases or forward guida nce that remain available to us , that are tools we could\nturn to in the unlikely event that we need to add accommodation. S o negative rates is not\nsomething that we ’re actively considering."
