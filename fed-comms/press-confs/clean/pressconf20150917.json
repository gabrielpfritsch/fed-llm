  "text": "September 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nSeptember 17, 2015\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. As you know from our policy statement released a\nshort time ago, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed the current 0 to ¼ percent target\nrange for the federal funds rate. Since the Committee met in July, the pace of job gains has been\nsolid, the unemployment rate has declined, and overall labor market conditions have continued to\nimprove. I nflation , however, has continued to run below our longer -run objective , partly\nreflecting declines in energy and import prices. While we still expect that the downward\npressure on inflation from these factors will fade over time , recent global economic and financial\ndevelopments are like ly to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. These\ndevelopments may also restrain U.S. activity somewhat but have not led at this point to a\nsignificant change in the Committee ’s outlook for the U.S. economy.\nThe Committee continues to anticipate that the first increase in the federal funds rate will\nbe appropriate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably\nconfident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term . It\nremains the case that the Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase based on its\nassessment of the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook . I will note\nthat the importance of the initial increase should not be overstated : The stance of monetary\npolicy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the initial increase in\nthe federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum\nemployment and 2 percent inf lation. I will come back to today ’s policy decision in a few\nmoments, but first I would like to review recent economic developments and the outlook.\nSmoothing through the quarterly volatility, U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated\nto have expanded at a 2 ¼ percent pace in the first half of the year, a notably stronger outcome\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nthan expected in June, when Committee participants had submitted economic projections.\nContinued job gains and increases in real disposable income have supported household spe nding.\nGrowth in business fixed investment was moderate, held down in part by a significant\ncontraction in oil drilling activity as a result of the large drop in oil prices over the past year.\nMoreover, net exports were a substantial drag on GDP growth d uring the first half of the year,\nreflecting the earlier appreciation of the dollar and weaker foreign demand. T he Committee\ncontinues to expect a moderate pace of overall GDP growth even though the restraint from net\nexports is likely to persist for a ti me.\nThe labor market has shown further progress so far this year toward our objective of\nmaximum employment. Over the past three months, job gains averaged 220,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate, at 5.1 percent in August, was down 0.4 percent from the latest reading\navailable at the time of our June meeting , although that decline was accompanied by some\nreduction in the labor force participation rate over the same period. A broader measure of\nunemployment that includes individuals who want and are avai lable to work but have not\nactively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time\nhas continued to improve . That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains: While the\nunemployment rate is close to most FOMC parti cipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal\nlevel, the participation rate is still below estimates of its underlying trend , involuntary part -time\nemployment remains elevated, and wage growth remains subdued .\nInflation has continued to run below our 2 perce nt objective, partly reflecting declines in\nenergy and import prices. My colleagues and I continue to expect that the effects of these factors\non inflation will be transitory. However, the recent additional decline in oil prices and further\nappreciation of the dollar mean that it will take a bit more time for these effects to fully dissipate.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nAccordingly, the Committee anticipates that inflation will remain quite low in the coming\nmonths. As these temporary effects fade and, importantly, as the labor ma rket improves further,\nwe expect inflation to move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective . Survey -based\nmeasures of longer -term inflation exp ectations have remained stable. However, the Committee\nhas taken note of recent declines in m arket -based m easures of inflation compensation and will\ncontinue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\nThis assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections\nsubmitted for this meeting by FOMC participants , which now extend through 20 18. As\nannounced in the minutes from our July meeting, we are also introducing a modest enhancement\nto the Summary of Economic Projections by publishing the median projection across FOMC\nparticipants. These medians provide a concise summary statistic of participants ’ perspectives.\nThey should not, however, be interpreted as a collective view or a Committee forecast. As\nalways, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate\nmonetary policy.\nReflecting upward revision s for the first half of the year, participants increased their\nprojections for economic growth this year, compared with the projections made in conjunction\nwith the June FOMC meeting. T he median growth projection is 2.1 percent for this year and\nrises to 2.3 percent in 2016, somewhat above the median estimate of the longer -run normal\ngrowth rate. Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer -run rate. The\nunemployment rate projections are a bit lower than in June. At the end of thi s year, the median\nunemployment rate projection stands at 5 percent , down 0.3 percent from June and close to the\nmedian estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate . Committee participants generally\nsee the unemployment rate declining a little furt her next year and then leveling out . Finally,\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nFOMC participants project inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and\nnon-energy import prices . As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor\nmarket conditions c ontinue to firm, the median inflation projection rises from just 0.4 percent\nthis year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2018 . The path of the median inflation\nprojections is a bit lower than in June.\nThe outlook abroad appears to have bec ome more uncertain of late, and heightened\nconcerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies have led to notable\nvolatility in financial markets. Developments since our July meeting —including the drop in\nequity prices, the further appreci ation of the dollar, and a widening in risk spreads —have\ntightened overall financial conditions to some extent. These developments may restrain U.S.\neconomic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the\nnear term. Given the significant economic and financial interconnections between the United\nStates and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.\nReturning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on\ntoday ’s policy decision. The recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far\nand domestic spending appears sufficiently robust that an argument can be made for a rise in\ninterest rates at this time. We discussed this possibility at our meeting. However, in light of the\nheightened uncertainties abroad and a slightly softer expected path for inflation, the Committee\njudged it appropriate to wait for more evidence, including some further improvement in the labor\nmarket, to bolster its confidence th at inflation will rise to 2 percent in the medium term. Now, I\ndo not want to overplay the implications of these recent developments, which have not\nfundamentally altered our outlook. The economy has been performing well, and we expect it to\ncontinue to do so.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nAs I noted earlier, i t remains the case that the timing of the initial increase in the federal\nfunds rate will depend on the Committee ’s assessment of the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook . To be clear, our decision wil l not hinge on any particular\ndata release or on day -to-day movements in financial markets. Instead, the decision will depend\non a wide range of economic and financial indicators and our assessment of their cumulative\nimplications for actual and expected progress toward our objectives.\nLet me again emphasize that the specific timing of the initial increase in the target range\nfor the federal funds rate is far less important for the economy than the entire expected path of\ninterest rates . And o nce we begin to remove policy accommodation, we continue to expect that\neconomic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the\ntarget federal funds rate.\nCompared with the projections made in June, many FOMC participants lowered\nsomewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, including estimates of the longer -run normal\nlevel. Most participants continue to expect that economic conditions will make it appropriate to\nraise the target range for the federal funds rate later this yea r, although four participants now\nexpect that such con ditions will not be seen until next year or later . The median projection for\nthe federal funds rate rises to about 1 ½ percent in late 2016, 2 ½ percent in late 2017, and\n3½ percent in 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the medians are about ¼ percentage point below those\nprojected in June. The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the rate that most\nparticipants expect to prevail in the longer run despite the fact that the media n projection has the\nunemployment rate slightly below its longer -run normal level and inflation close to our 2 percent\nobjective . Participants provide d a number of explanations for their low federal funds rate\nprojections. These included, in particular, the residual effects of the financial crisis, which are\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nlikely to continue to constrain spending for some time , as well as headwinds from abroad . But\nthe restraining influence of these factors on real activity —as the restraining influence of these\nfactors on real activity dissipate s further, most participants expect the federal funds rate to move\nto its longer -run normal level by the end of 2018.\nI’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate,\nas usual, are cond itional on participants ’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for\neconomic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors. But our actual policy actions over\ntime will depend on how economic conditions evolve, which is quite uncertain. If the expansion\nproves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected,\nthen the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory . Conversely, if\nconditions were to prove weaker, then the appropri ate trajectory would be lower and less steep.\nFinally, the Committee will continue its policy of rei nvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities .\nThe Committee ’s sizable holding s of longer -term securities should help maintain accommodative\nfinancial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives.\nThank you . Let me stop there. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman, CNBC. Madam Chair, this notion of uncertainty in\neconomic and global developments —is it fair to say that it could be many months before those\nglobal developments work their way t hrough the U .S. economic data, and that you would not\nhave the certainty that you ’re looking for to raise interest rates for many months and perhaps\nwell into next year?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, Steve, I think you can see from the SEP projections that most\nparticipants continue d to think that economic conditions wil l call for or make appropr iate a n\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nincrease in the federal funds rate by the end of this year. Four participants moved their\nprojections into 2016 or later, but the great majority of participants continued to hold that view .\nAnd, of course, there will always be uncertainty. We ca n’t expect that uncertainty to be fully\nresolved. But, in light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial\nmarkets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States.\nAnd, as I mentioned, t he inflation outlook has softened slightly. We’ve had some further\ndevelopments —namely , lower oil prices and a further appreciation of the dollar —that have put\nsome downward pressure in the near term on inflation. Now, we fully expect those further\neffec ts, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices , to be transitory . But there is a little\nbit of downward pressure on inflation , and we would like to see some further developments .\nAnd this , importantly , could include —is likely to include —further improvements in the labor\nmarket that would bolster our confidence tha t inflation will move back to 2 percent over the\nmedium term.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Could I ask about the next\nmeeting, which is in October ? Do you view that as a live meeting even though there isn ’t going\nto be a scheduled press conference at that time ? And what kind of developments would you\nneed to see to be confident in moving in the near term ? Is it more important , the developments\nin the fin ancial market s, or is it more to do with the upcoming data? Thanks very much.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, as I ’ve said before, every meeting is a live meeting where the\nCommittee can make a decision to move to change our target for the federal funds rate. That\ncertainly includes October. As you know , and I ’ve stressed previously, were we to decide to do\nthat, we would call a press briefing , and you ’ve participated in an exercise to make sure that you\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nwould know how to participate in that press briefing should it happen. So, yes, October remains\na possibility.\nAnd we will be looking at incoming developments , both financial an d economic , to try to\nmake sure w e feel , really , that the U .S. economy is doing well. You know, I want to emphasize ,\ndomestic developments have been strong. We see domestic demand growing at a solid pace, the\nlabor market continuing to improve. Of course, we will watch incoming data to confirm our\nexpectation that that will continue. And we , of course , will watch glo bal financial and economic\ndevelopment s. I can ’t give you a recipe for exactly what we ’re looking to see , but, as we say, we\nwant to see continued improvement in the labor market , and we would like to bolster our\nconfidence tha t inflation will move back t o 2 percent . And, of course, a further improv ement in\nthe labor market does serve that purpose. There could be other things we would see that could\nbolster that confidence , but further improvement in the labor market will serve to do that.\nJIM PUZZANGHER A. Hi. Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times. There were a group\nof protesters out here before your meeting. There was a similar group at Jackson Hole . They\nand others have warned the F ed not to raise the rate because —out of concern that the labor\nmarket is not fully healed, wages haven ’t risen fast enough . What impact, if any, has that had on\nyou and your colleagues in your decision today?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, we have been receiving advice from a large number of\neconomists and interested groups , and that ’s of course appropriate , and we value hearing the\nopinions of many —you know, many different groups and individuals with different perspectives.\nBut, look, at the end of the day, it ’s the Committee ’s job to come together to analyze the data that\nwe have on the economy , to decide how it affects the outlook , and to try to deliberate and arrive\nat a Committee judgment about the appropriate path of policy, and that ’s what we did today. As\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nI said, although we are close to many participant ’s [estimates] and the median estimate of the\nlonger -run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment —and this has been true for a\nlong time —is that there are additional margins of slack , particularly relating to very high levels\nof part -time involuntary employme nt and labor force participation , that suggest that , at least to\nsome extent , the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market.\nBut we are getting closer. The labor market has improved. And, as I’ve said in the past, we\ndon’t want to wait until we ’ve fully met both of our objectives to begin the process of tightening\npolicy give n the lags in the operation of monetary policy.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Thank you. Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal. Madam\nChair, do you thin k, over the past two months since your last meeting , that you ’ve gotten clos er\nto or further away from the F ed’s inflation goals ? And then , separately, you ’ve received a\ncongressional subpoena relating to the disc losure of information from the F ed’s Septe mber 2012\npolicy meeting. Are you any closer to complyin g with that ? Have you turned over any new\ninformation to Congress?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, your first question was, have we come closer or move d further\naway from our inflation goal. So we ’ve used the same language , which is that we expect to\nachieve our 2 present goal over the medium term , and I would say , although we —as we say in\nour statement, recent developments seem likely to put some downward pressure . We’re, after\nall, way below our inflation target. But an important reason for that is that declines in import\nprices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and decline s in energy prices are holding down\ninflation well below our target and well below core inflation. We expect those effects to be\ntransitory , and with well -anchored inflation expectations, we expect inflation to move back to\n2 percent . Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nand some further downward pressure on energy prices , and that creates a bit of further drag on\ninflation that I would view as transitory —is very likely to be transitory. So I continue and the\nCommittee continues to expect tha t inflation will move back to 2 percent , so this should be a\nsmal l thing. And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor\nmarket, a labor market moving toward full employment , is one t hat historically has generated\nupward pressure on inflation. So that bolsters my confidence in infl ation. On the other hand,\nwe’ve had a long period in which inflation has been running below our objective. I consider it ,\nand the Committee does , very important that we —we achieve our inflation objective and defend\nagainst inflation that is persistently above our inflation objective and also persistently below our\ninflation objective. And we want to have not only an expectation , but a good degree of\nconfidence that that will occur. We did take note in the statement of a decline in inflation\ncompensation , and it ’s hard to get a direct read on inflation expectations out of these measures.\nThey can be pushed down by factors pertaining to liquidit y in the T reasury —in the TIPs market\nand other issues pertaining to risk premia, but we have taken note of that , and I would say that\nthat’s something that has caught our attention and is a factor that we ’re watching. So we ’d like\nto have a little bit more confidence , but I would not interpret developments during the\nintermeeting period as significantly undermining confidence. And the labor market is really\nimportant that as it continues to improve —it has , and we want to see it improve further —that\nserves to bolster c onfidence.\nOh, I’m sorry , you asked about the September 2012 leak. We are working very closely\nwith House Financial Services C ommittee that ’s requested information to satisfy their request.\nWe’re working very closely with them.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. The economic\nprojections that you all released today show that Committee members expect roughly a three -\nyear period in which the unemployment rate will be at its lowest sustainable level and yet\ninflation will not rise abov e 2 percent. That seems extraordinary . Could you talk about why , as\na moment ago you said we would expect inflationary pressures when unemployment is at a low\nlevel? Why is inflation going to be so weak for so long under those circumstances , and does it\nindicate —when you are projecting that basically much of a decade will have passed without the\nFed reaching its inflation target —does it indicate that you have failed to do enough to revive this\neconomy in recent years?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can\nto revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective. And after we took\nthe funds rate down to zero, as you know, we put in place a number of other extraordinary\nmeasures —including forward guidance and large -scale asset purchases —in order to speed the\nrecovery and attain both our inflation objective and our maximum employment objective. And, I\nmean , when you look at the projection, you see , as you mentioned , that we see s ufficient growth\nto push the unemployment rate. It’s already very close to participants ’ estimates of its longer -run\nnormal level. We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly —or, at least , participants project\nthat it will fall slightly below that l evel. As that occurs, we would expect labor force\nparticipation, the cyclical component of that , to diminish over time , and we would hope to see\nsome decline in the portion of slack that ’s reflected in high levels of part -time involuntary\nemployment.\nNow, inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent . It takes to 2018 to get there.\nIt’s awfully close in 2017 , and it ’s not terribly far away even next year. We have very large\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\ndrags from import prices and energy prices , and over the next year or so, those things should\ndissipate . And the behavior of inflation should mainly —if we —if our understanding of the\ninflationary process is correct and if inflation exp ectations are well anchored at 2 , which I\nbelieve they are , as the labor market heals and a s that healing progresses, we will see further\nupward pressure on inflation. That’s what we expect. Now, it ’s a slow process, it ’s\ncharacterized by lags , and that ’s why it takes a few years as the inflation —as the unemployment\nrate falls and even overshoots its longer -run normal level, it just takes some time for inflation to\nget back to 2 percent. But the overshooting helps it get back faster than it otherwise would . And\nit’s certainly important for us , and I think our credibility hinges on defe nding our inflat ion target\nnot only from threats that it rises above , but also that we not have —that over the medium term ,\nthat we want to see inflation get back to 2 percent . And we believe the policies we ’re following\nare des igned to accomplish that and will do so.\nYLAN MUI. Hi, thanks. Ylan from the Washington Post. I want to kind of piggybac k\non Binya ’s question a little bit and brin g up the old thresholds of 6.5 percent unemployment and\n2.5 percent inflation as the period during which the F ed promi sed to ke ep interest rates low.\nThat had sort of assumed —I guess sort of suggested that the F ed was comfortabl e with inflation\nrising above 2 percent . But you just said moments ago that you don ’t want to wait until inflation\nactually hit s your target before you are ready to lift off. So I wonder if you could explain that a\nlittle bit. Is there a shift in how much inflation the Fed is actually willing to accept?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me be clear —2 percent is our objective. We wan t to see\ninflation go back to 2 percent ; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation. So we ’re not trying to push\nthe inflation rate above 2. It’s always our ob jective to get back to 2, but 2 percent is not a\nceiling. And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that , on average ,\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nwould hold the inflation rate below 2 percent . That is not our policy. We want to see t he\ninflation rate get back to 2 percent as rapidly as we can. But there are lags in the impact of\nmonetary policy on the economy . And if we waited until inflation is back to 2 —and that would\nprobably mean that unemployment had declined well below our estimates of the natural rate —\nand only then did we start to —begin to —and, you know, the word “tighten” monetary policy I\ndon’t think is really right because we have an immensely accommodative monetary policy in\nplace. So, let me say, just to begin to diminish the extraordinary degree of accommodation for\nmonetary policy, we would be overshoot —we would likel y overshoot substantially our 2 percent\nobject ive, and we might be faced with then having to tighten policy in a way that could be\ndisruptive to the real economy. And I don’t —I don ’t think that ’s a desirable way to conduct\npolicy.\nJEANNA SMIALEK . Jeanna S mialek , Bloomberg News. You mentioned earlier that,\nyou know, there is always going to be some uncertainty in the global economy, yet it seems that\nuncertainties are what kept you from hiking this month. You know, ho w do you communicate to\nmarkets w hat is the kind of uncertainty that keeps you from lifting rates and what is the kind of\nuncertainty you can overlook and, you know, move in spite of?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, that ’s a very hard question , and, you know, it ’s why we come\ntogether and have very careful evaluations of a wide ra nge of factors. But, at the end of the day,\nwhat we ’re focused on are two things : the path for employment and whether or not we feel\nconfident that we ’re on a road that will take us to our maximum employment objective and\nwhether or not we see the risks around obtaining that as balanced. Of course , there will be\nuncertainty around it and whether or not we have reasonable confidence that inflation, will, ove r\nthe medium term, go back to 2 percent . And it ’s really through that filter that we ’re trying to\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nlook at uncertainty. Of course , there are ma ny uncertainties in the global economy , but we ’re\nasking ourselves how economic and financial developments in the global economy affect the risk\nto our outlook for our two goals and whether or not they create un balanced risks that we want to\nwait to resolve , to some extent.\nPETER BARNES. Hi, Chair Yellen. Peter Barnes, F ox Business. Could you talk\nabout —a little bit more specifically about what foreign developments you discussed in the\nmeeting today, what you ’re concerned about? We all assume it might be China —that was in the\nJuly minutes. Are you concerned about the Chinese economy slowing , the markets there? Do\nyou have any concerns about the European economy? And then , related to stock markets, could\nI ask you how you feel about U .S. equity markets right now ? Because you did talk about your\nconcerns about them back in May. You saw they were generally quite high and were worried\nabout potential dangers in U .S. equity market valuations , but now equity pri ces have pulled back.\nThank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, with respect to global developments, we reviewed developments\nin all important areas of the world , but we ’re focused particularly on China and emerging\nmarkets. Now, we ’ve long expected, as most analyst s have , to see some slowing in Chinese\ngrowth over time as they rebalance their economy. And they have planned that , and I think there\nare no surprises there. The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt\nslowdown than most analys ts expect. And I think developments that we saw in financial markets\nin August in part reflected concerns that Chinese —there was downside risk to Chinese economic\nperformance and perhaps concerns about the de ftness with which policymakers were addressing\nthose concerns.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nIn addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity\nmarkets , and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market\neconomies that are important producers of commodities as well as more advanced countries ,\nincluding Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected\nby declining commodity prices, declining energy prices.\nNow, there are a lot of countries that are net importers of energy that are pos itively\naffected by those developments , but emerging markets —important emerging markets —have\nbeen negatively affected by those developments. And we ’ve seen significant outflows of capital\nfrom those countries, pressures on their exchange rates , and concerns about their performance\ngoing forward. So a lot of our focus has been on risks around China , but not just China —\nemerging markets , more generally , and how they may spill over to the United States. In terms of\nthinking about financial develop ments and our reaction to them, I think a lot of the financial\ndevelopments were really —so, we don ’t want to respond to market turbulence. The F ed should\nnot be responding to the ups and downs of the markets , and it is certainly not our policy to do so.\nBut when there are significant financial developments, it ’s incumbent on us to ask ourselves\nwhat is causing them. And, of course , while we can ’t know for sure, it seem ed to us as though\nconcerns about the global economic outlook were drivers of those fin ancial development s. And\nso they have concerned us in part because they take us to the global outlook and how that will\naffect us. And, to some extent, look, we have seen a tightening of financial conditions during —\nas I mentioned, during the intermeeting period. So the stock market adjustment , combined with\na somewhat stronger dollar and higher risk spreads , does represent some tightening of financial\nconditions.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nNow, in and of itself, it ’s not the end of story in terms of our policy because we have to\nput a lot of different pieces together. We are looking at, as I emphasized, a U .S. economy that\nhas been performing well and impressing us by the pace at which it ’s creating jobs and the\nstrength of domestic demand. So we have that. We have some concerns about negative impacts\nfrom global developments and some tightening of financial conditions. We’re trying to put all of\nthat together in a picture. I think, importantly , we say in our statem ent that in spite of all of this ,\nwe continue to view the risks to economic activity and labor markets as balanced. So it’s a lot of\ndifferent pieces, different cross currents, some strengthening the outlook, some creating\nconcerns, but overall, no significant change in the economic out look.\nANN SAPHIR. Ann Saphir with Reuters. Just to piggyback on the global\nconsiderations —as you say, the U .S. economy has been growing . Are you worried that , given\nthe global interconnect ednes s, the low inflation globally, all of the other concerns tha t you just\nspoke about , that you may never escape from this zero lower bound situation ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would be very —I would be very surprised if that ’s the case.\nThat is not the way I see the outlook or the way the Committee sees the outlook. Can I\ncompletely rule it out? I can ’t completely rule it out. But, really , that’s an ex treme downside\nrisk that in no way is near the center of my outlook.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and T elevision. If the\neconomy develops as the Summary of Economic Projection s suggests , you will see improvement\nin labor markets , but it won ’t push inflation up any faster. So I’m wondering what the argument\nis for raising rates this year as suggested by the dot plot, because even allowing for long a nd\nvariable lags, you ’re not forecasting an inflation problem that would seem to suggest the need for\na steeper and faster rate path for at least a couple of years.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a\nvery long ti me from here and the economy performs as we expect —namely , it’s strong and the\nrisks that are out there don ’t materialize —my concern will be that we will have much more\ntightening in labor markets than you see in these projections . And the lags will be pr obably\nslow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation\nobjective , and then we ’ll be forced into a kind of stop –go policy. We will have pushed the\neconomy so far it will have become overheated , and we will then hav e to tighten policy more\nabruptly than we ’d like. And instead of having slow , steady growth , improvement in the labor\nmarket , and continued improvement and good performance in the labor market, I don ’t think it ’s\ngood policy to have to then slam on the br akes and risk a downturn in the economy.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby with Dow Jones Newswires. One of your colleagues\nin the dot plots said they’d like to see negative interest rates —didn’t expect to see that. What do\nyou make of negative interest rates as a potential source of new stimulus if the F ed were to have\nto do something more, you know, as o pposed to maybe going to QE ? Does negative interest\nrates have any part —does it —is it—should it be part of the F ed’s toolkit , essentially?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, let me be clear that negative interest rates was not something that\nwe considered very seriously at all today. It’s—was not one of our main policy options. But one\nparticipant in the Committee would like to see additional accommodation , is concerned by the\ninflation outlook , and thin ks that we need additional stimulus, additional accommodation to\nprovide that , and propose d doing so by moving interest rates negative. That’s something we ’ve\nseen in several European countries. It’s not something we talked about today. Look , if—I don ’t\nexpect that we ’re going to be in a path of providing additional accommodation , but if the outlook\nwere to change in a way that most of my colleagues and I do not expect and we found ourselves\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nwith a weak economy that needed additional stimulus, we would look at all of our available\ntools , and that would be something that we would evaluate in that kind of context.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. In July, when you were\ntalking to us , you said that you yourself expected to see the first rate hike before the end of the\nyear. Is that still your expectation? And also, when you talked about the developments in\nfinancial markets and what caused the August turbulence —you mentioned China and other\nthings —you did mention the prospects of a Fed rate increase. Do you think that played a role as\nwell?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So you ask me about my own expectation , and I ’d say —I don ’t want\nto—I speak on behalf of the Committee and try to explain Committee decisions , and we don ’t\nidentify who ’s who in terms of our projections of the funds rate , and I don ’t want to change that\nand have the focus be on my personal views on the path. You know, I have characterized the\nCommittee view as , you know, a forecast that will likely, if it prevails, if that ’s how the economy\nevolves, call for a funds rate increase later this year. And I think that ’s a fair summary of the\nCommittee ’s assessment of things. You asked me, I think, also about uncertainty about our own\npolicies?\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Well, no, not uncertainty , just the fact that the market\nturbulence —a lot of people in August said part of that was a concern about the F ed was about to\nraise interest rates, and you did n’t mention that as one reason for the turbulence.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think the main drivers of the turbulence have been concerns\nabout the global outlook, that ’s how I read it . But I know that, of cour se, there is uncertainty\nabout F ed policy. As I mentio ned, we ’re well aware that there ’s been a huge focus on the\ndecision today. And, you know, I would ask you to appreciat e that there are a lot of cross -\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\ncurrents in economic and financial developments that we need to take into account in deciding\non what th e appropriate course of policy is.\nAnd we don ’t make continuous decisions every single day about our policy , we meet\nperiodically. We do our darndest to pull together the best analysis we can and to exchange views\nand to arrive at Committee decisions. I do understand that , during this intermeeting pe riod, that\nevery word that an FOM C member has said has been parsed for its potential implications for\nwhat our decision will be. I think it ’s, you know —that’s an unfortunate state of affairs, but I\nunderstand , and I think it ’s natural when you ’re at a point when conditions may be falling in\nplace for there to be a shift in policy. It’s natural that that should happen , and it does, to some\nextent , contribute to uncertainty in financial markets.\nMICHELLE FLEURY . Hi, Michelle Fleury, BBC News. You talked a lot about the\nstrong dollar. I wondered, do you see your policy actions affecting the dollar? Is it something\nyou consider when you are making your policy decisions?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, monetary policy —U.S. monetary policy is directed toward trying\nto achieve the goals the Congress has laid out for us. When we —when monetary policy tightens\nand interest rates rise, it commonly is the case , either when it happens or in expectation —the\nexpectation that that ’s coming —interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce capital flows\nthat have impacts on exchange rates .1 So monetary policy often has some effect on the exchange\nrate, and it ’s not , in my view , the main channel by which monetary policy works. It’s one of a\nnumber of different channels by which monetary policy works , but it does have some impact on\nexchange rates , and, of course, yes, we need to take that into account.\n\n1 Chair Yellen intended to say that “interest rate differentials globally do tend to induce capital flows that have\nimpacts on exchange rates.”\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I want to see if you would shift gears a\nlittle bit and talk about the housing market. You say in the statement , the housing market has\nimproved . How much are you counting on the housing market for growth going forward ,\nespecially since the Committee sees rates rising? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we are envisioning further improvements in the housing market.\nIt remains ver y depressed —housing starts bel ow levels that seem consistent with underlying\ndemographics, especially in an economy that ’s creating jobs , and we have lots of pe ople who are\nstill doubled up , and demand for housing should be there and should materialize as the job\nmarket improves and income growth improves. So, are we counting on it? Housing is now a\nvery small sector of the economy. It is not the driver of —it is not the key driver in my own\nforecast of ongoing improvements in the U .S. economy. It plays a supporting role , but consumer\nspending is the main driver , bolstered by, you know, a decent outlook for investment spending.\nBut I would continue to expect h ousing to improve. And, remember, we ’re envisioning , if things\ngo as we anticipate , a pretty gra dual path of increases in short -term interest rates over time. To\nsome extent , that’s already embodied in longer term rates. On the other hand , as time passe s and\nwe move beyond the window in which short rates are zero, it will be natural for long rates to rise\nsome. And, of course , we recognize that the housing market is sensitive to mortgage rate s. It’s\na—it is an important factor. But that ’s something that, of course , we are taking into account in\nthinking about what ’s the appropriate path of policy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. You\nmentioned you ’ve gotten a lot of unsolicited advice —the folks outside. But there is another side\nthat says the F ed should raise interest rates because keeping rates so long —so low for so long\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\nhas actually exacerbated th e wealth gap. Do you think the F ed has widened the wealth gap with\nits low interest rate policy? These people say low i nterest rates mainly benefit the wealthy.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I guess I really don ’t see it that way. It is true that interest rates\naffect asset prices , but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and\nassets. To me , the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to\nwork. And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by a high —having high unemployment\nand a weak job market that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulne rable\nindividuals, to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market\nthat has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population, that ’s not\nsomething that increases income inequality.\nThere have been a number of studies that have done —been done recently that have tried\nto take account of many different ways in which monetary policy , acting through different parts\nof the transmission mechanism , affect inequality. And there ’s a lot of guesswork inv olved , and\ndifferent analyse s can come up with different things. But a pretty recent paper that ’s quite\ncomprehensive concludes that Fed policy has not exacerbated income inequality.\nJON PRIOR. Thanks. What —I’m Jon Prior with Politico . What role did a possible\ngovernment shutdown this year play in your decision today to delay the rate hike , and what\nwould you say to lawmakers who are pursuing th is strategy yet again?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, it played absolutely no role in our decision. I believe it ’s the\nresponsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with a debt ceiling\nso that America pays its bills. We have a good recovery in place that ’s really making progress ,\nand to see Congress take actions that would en danger that progress —I think that would be more\nthan unfortunate. So, to me , that’s Congress ’s job. Congress charged us with forming an\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\neconomic outloo k that is focused on the medium term and taking appropriate policy actions\nbased on that outlook , and t hat’s what we have done in the past and will continue to do going\nforward.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of MNI. You said in y our opening\nstatement that the F ed’s policy of maintaining a large balance sheet —by not starting to shrink\nthat bala nce sheet by curtailing reinvestments and rollovers —that helps add to your\naccommodative monetary stance on top of the near -zero federal funds rate. By delaying rate\nhikes, logically , are you not also delaying reducing the balance sheet? A year ago, the FOMC\nsaid it would not start shrinking the balance sheet and still it ’s—until it started raising the funds\nrate. So is it a concern that you are delaying normalization of the balance sheet ? W as that an\nissue that you and your colleagues discussed? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. We have been —and this was reported in the minutes of our July\nmeeting —we have been discussing reinvestment policy. Our normalization principles indicated\nthat we would not begin to either reduce or eliminate reinvestments until after we have begun to\nraise the federal funds rate. Our principles said that the exact timing of that would depend on\neconomic and financial conditions and our evaluation of them, and that guidance continues to be\naccurate —we don ’t have anything further on it . But it is certainly true that we have committed\nto wait to begin running down our balance sheet until after we ’ve begun the process of\nnormalization. So, yes, if we defer, this is not a very large matter that we ’re talking about from a\nstimulus point of view . But it is , to some extent , true that if we delay raising the rate, it\nprobably —maybe delays the timing at which that process will begin. But there ’s no fixed —\nwe’ve not given some fixed amount of time at so many months after we start . And we ’re\n\nSeptember 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINA L\n\ncontinuing to discuss what the appropriate timing would be of that policy and haven ’t made any\nfurther decisions on that just yet."
