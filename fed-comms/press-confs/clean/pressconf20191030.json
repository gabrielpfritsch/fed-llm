  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , and welcome. My colleagues at the Federal\nReserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people. We do this by steadfastly pursuing\nthe goals that Congress has given us : maximum employment and stable prices. We ’re\ncommitted to making the best decisions we can based o n facts and objective analysis.\nToday we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year. We took this\nstep to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide\nsome insurance against ongoing risks. As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have\nmade since last year are providing —and will continue to provide —meaningful support to the\neconomy. We believe that mone tary policy is in a good place.\nThe U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains\nfavorable. The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate. Household spending continues to\nbe strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. In\ncontrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined\nover the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those\nsectors. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate,\nreflecting solid household spending and s upportive financial conditions.\nThe job market remains strong. The unemployment rate has been near h alf-century lows\nfor a year and a half. The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid ; we had\nexpected some slowing after last year’s strong pace. Participation in the labor force by people in\ntheir prime working years has been increas ing, a nd wages have been rising, particularly for\nlower -paying jobs. People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us\nthat many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better\n\nchapters to their liv es. This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that\nthe strong job market rea ches more of those left behind.\nInflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months\nthrough August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent. Inflation\npressures remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end\nof their historic ranges. We’re mindful that continued below -target inflation could lead to an\nunwelcome downward slide in long- term inflation expectations. However, against the backdrop\nof a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.\nOverall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor\nmarket, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely. While this has been\nour outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that wil l best achieve\nthese outcomes have changed significantly over the past year. As I mentioned, weakness in\nglobal growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.\nThese factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to lower our assessment\nof the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year. In both July and September,\nwe reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so\nagain today, bringi ng the range to 1½ to 1¾ percent.\nThe policy adjustments we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support\nfor the economy. Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments\non economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time. We see the current\nstance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about\nthe economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong\nlabor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. We believe monetary policy\n\nis in a good place to achieve these outcomes. Looking ahead, we ’ll be monitoring the effects of\nour policy actions, along with other information bearing on the out look, as we assess the\nappropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge\nthat cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Po licy is not\non a preset course.\nLet me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations. In January,\nwe made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves\nregime. In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our\nadmi nistered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves.\nIn the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the\ngradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July.\nIn response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid- September,\nwe concluded that it would be appropriate to maintain , over a time —over time , a level of reserve\nbalances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year. To achieve this\nample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the\nsecond quarter of next year as well as conti nue temporary open market opera tions at least\nthrough January.\nThese actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of\nmonetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves. They do not\nrepresent a change in the stance of monetary policy. In particular, our Treasury bill purchases\nshould not be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the\nfinancial crisis. In those programs, we purchased longer -term securities to put downward\npressure on longer -term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions. In contrast,\n\nincreasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short -term\nassets held by the public and should not materially a ffect demand and supply for longer -term\nsecurities or financial conditions more broadly.\nThank you. I will be happy to take your questions.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McK ee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. So I guess\nthe question is , is this it? Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve\nyour goal of sustaining the expansion? And as far as global Wall Street’ s primary question, what\nkind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess —some sort of sig nificant\ndeterioration in what?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we ’ve said, to repeat , is that we see the current stance of\npolicy as “ likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy\nremains broadly consistent with our outlook.” And we say that, really, becau se both of the\nperformance of the economy and the stance of policy. The performance of the economy has\nbeen —particularly the household sector —has been strong, has been resilient , with low\nunemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation\nmoving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending. The\nmanufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing , and also investment and exports have been\nweaker. But, overall, we ’ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.\nWe see the outlook a s for more of the same. We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps\nhaving moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some\nremain —some things remain to be seen. So that ’s the economy.\nTurning to policy, we ’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more\naccommodative stance, and , after the cuts a t the last three meetings, the federal funds r ate is now\n\nin a range between 1 ½ and 1¾ percent . We feel that policy is well positioned to support the\noutlook that I described. So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I\nmentioned, we ’re going to be watching all factors , And if developments emerge that c ause a\nmaterial reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. But that ’s what it would\ntake: a materi al reassessment of our outlook.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up—i f the markets decide that you need to cut\nrates again , will you be for ced to follow?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about\nthe risks to the outlook, and I ’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is. It’ s for moderate\ngrowth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective. If something happens\nto cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that ’s what would cause us to change our views\non the appropriate stance of policy.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post . You just said that the\nrisks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction. I’m wondering if you could specify—is\nthat on trade , or are there other matters? This morning we obviously learned that we ’ve now had\ntwo quarters of contracting business investment , which would seem to be moving the outlook in\nthe other direction.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there —the principal\nrisks that we ’ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth and trade policy\ndevelopments as well as muted inflat ion pressure. So I was really referring there to trade\ndevelopments. We have that phase -one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put\ninto effect , could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and re ducing uncertainty, and that\nwould bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time. So that has\n\nthe potential for being an improvement in the risk picture. Brexit , I would say, as well —it\nappears that the risk of a no -deal Brexit seems to have materially declined. I think on both\nsituations there ’s plenty of risk left, but I’ d have to say that t he risks seem to have subsided.\nYou asked about business investment, and that ’s right. Business investment has been\nweak , and t oday ’s reading was weak as well . And it was broad acro ss equipment and other parts\nof—all parts of business fixed investment were weak. That ’s consistent with what we ’ve seen,\nbut that ’s the economy we ’ve had this year. What we ’ve had is an economy where the consumer\nis really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost\n3 percent in this quarter —in this first reading for the quarter. So, overall, we see the economy as\nhaving been resilient to the —you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.\nHEATHER LONG. Can I just follow up quickly? I mean , there ’s this concern that I\nsometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn\naround and cut employment? You know, sort of , if they continue to be concerned. Can you give\na sense of how the C ommittee is thinking—thi nking through that possibility?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, so that is a risk. That ’s a risk that we’ ve been monitoring, but\nwe don’ t see it yet. We don’ t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that. But the\nrisk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing— in export investment , business\ninvestment , parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don ’t\nsee that.\nWhat we continue to see is good job creation. U nemployment has declined again, and\nthe household survey is now at a 50- year low —has been, you know, very close to 50- year low s\nfor 18 months now. So it ’s very positive. The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our\nvast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on,\n\nyou know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that ’s their principle focus. So that is the\nthing that ’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’ t seem to have been affected so far by\nweakness in the other areas.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. So you’ ve previously sort of compared this rate -cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in\nthe ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan F ed took those cuts back after a while.\nThey raised rates again fairly quickly. And I guess I ’m just curious what the onus is for doing\nthat in this cycle. Wh at would make you guys decide it ’s appropriate to raise interest rates\nagain?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the reason why we raised interest rates is because —generally is\nbecause we see inflation as moving up —or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really\ndon’t see that now. Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year. We thought that that\nwas due , to some extent , to idiosyncratic or transient factors. That turns out to have been the\ncase, so it ’s moved back up. But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent . So we really don’ t\nsee that risk .\nAnd inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways —both surveys\nand market based over the course of this —of, really , the recent mont hs. And, you know, we\nthink that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we ’re strongly\ncommitted to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis. We think it ’s\nessential that we do that.\nSo we ’re not thinking about raising rates right now. There obviously will be times in the\nfuture where that will be appropriate. What we ’re really thinking now is that our current stance\n\nof policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our\nexpectations.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. —Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I ’m—not to make\nlight of it, but I ’m a little bit— I wonder if you could help me out with the appropr iate\nunderstanding of the word “appropriate” here. S o the statement says that the Committee is going\n“to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the\nappropriate path of the target range. ” That tells me you could go either way. You came in , and\nyou used the word “ appropr iate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate ,” which\nmeans you’ re on hold. So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from\nthis believing what “ appropriate ” means? Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you\nshould rem ain on hold, or is it , really , you could go either way here? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain\nappropriate —likely to remain appropriate —as long as incoming information about the economy\nis broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth,\nstrong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent . That’s—so that ’s what we’ re\nsaying about that. We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a material\nreassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly. So that ’s really how we ’re\nthinking about it. I can ’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds. It\nreally —it would be a reassessment of —a material reassessment of our overall outlook, which is\nwhat I described.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I ’m sorry, just to—why isn’ t the phrase “likely to remain\nappropriate” in the statem ent if that’ s the sense of the C ommittee?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, there’s —there ’s a lot of, you know, pract ice and science and\nhistory , in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we\nsay in the press conference statement. It’ s a—you know, it ’s a judgment call. You know, I ’m\nsaying it now, so —\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thanks.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal . You\ndescribed the recent sl ide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome. ” You said that\ninflation expectations are “very important .” What, if anything, would the C ommittee be\nprepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are —\nthey’ re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflati on. We need\nthem to be anchored in a level —at a level that ’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent\ninflation goal. And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.\nThat’s what we ’re doing now.\nWe’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way\nwe think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us —that would be more\nsupportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent —on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.\nThat’s at the ve ry heart of what we ’re doing in the review. It ’s too early to be announcing\ndecisions. We haven ’t made them yet . But we ’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we\ncan make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric\n2 percent inflation. And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation,\nand that is the —that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area. So we ’re\ncommitte d to doing that.\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS. How soon do you think that review mi ght be announced to the\npublic?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re in the middle —we ’re really quite in the middle of it now,\nand my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year. These are—you know, these\nchanges to monetary policy frameworks happen —they don’ t happen really quickly, let ’s say.\nInflation targeting took many years to evolve. I don’ t think we ’ll take many years here. I think\nwe’ll wrap it up around the middle of ne xt year , would be my guess. I have some confidence\nin that.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence of Fox Business. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman, for taking this. So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if\nyou get some of that uncertainty cleared up —specifically , the phase -one China trade deal\nfinished and USMCA ratified? How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it\nstands here, and could we see rate cuts next year —or, rate hikes next year ? I’m sorry.\nCHAIR POWELL. Rate hikes for next year .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes , because I ’ve heard the argument that t rade’s causing the\nuncertainty. U ncertainty is keeping the prices low. I ’ve heard that argument from a F ed\npresident from one of the D istricts. So you remove that uncerta inty, prices, then, would naturally\nrise. So could there be a point, or how —I guess my question is , how big of an impact on\nmonetary policy would removing that uncertainty be?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained\nreduction in trade tensions —broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these\nuncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment , which is —trade uncertainty ’s been\nweighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many a nalysts. And,\n\nultimately, it could affect activity. I wouldn’ t expect that the effects on activity or confidence\nwould be immediate , or—wo uld there be immediate effects i n economic activity. I think it\nwould take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time.\nYou come back to the question of raising rates . So that ’s really about inflation . And you\nknow, we haven’ t yet—we just touched 2 percent core i nflation , to pick one measure —just\ntouched it for a few months, and then we ’ve fallen back. So I think we would need to see a\nreally significant move up in inflation that ’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to\naddress inflation concerns.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times . The other thing you ’ve\ntalked about in this review is the gains that a super high- pressure labor market have, particularly\nfor the communities that you’ re talking about. You mentioned it just now whe n you were\ntalking. If that ’s something that you’ re identifying , and that ’s something that the Fe d is learning\nmore about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are\nreentering the labor force?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we ’re doing that. I mean, I think we ’re keeping—I\nthink we ’ve made very substantial adjustments to polic y over the course of this year , if you think\nabout it. We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, w e went to “patient ,” now\nwe’ve done three rate cuts. It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.\nSo we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’ re talking about,\nwhich are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. So if you were to d escribe the shifts that you ’ve made so far, it\nwasn ’t just about trade uncertainty. It was about , specifically , these kinds of high- pressure labor\ngains that you’ ve talked about.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, no. It was —so we ’ve said it was about three things. It ’s been\nabout the slowing global economy. You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity\naround the globe. It ’s been building for just about 18 months now, and that ’s having an effect on\nU.S. activity. That ’s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export , and business investment.\nWe’ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and\ninvestment and sentiment. And we ’ve had inflation, which—we ’ve called out the risk of\ninflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address. So we ’ve been\ndoing it to address all of those things.\nI would say, the gains in the labor market have been great to see. It ’s particularly the fact\nthat people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage\ngains in the last couple of years. That ’s a great thing. You know from our Fed Listens events\nthat we ’ve been hearing from people who live and work in low - and moderate -income\ncommunities that this is the best labor market they ’ve seen in their lifetime , things like that .\nAnd, by the way, that there ’s also —there ’s still so many people who are, you know, still\nnot in the labor market yet, and that —there ’s just a lot more good that can be done there. At the\nsame time, we have to think about the whole economy, and—but , yes, those gains are very\npositive. We do call them out. They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and\nthat’s something we ’re committed to doing.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. On the Fed’s balance sheet —you all recently resumed purchases of\nTreasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue ? And, given\nthe fact that, you know, the repo operations —it seems like the F ed is having to increase the\namount of liquidity— temporary liquidity that it ’s injecting into the system. You know, do you\n\nstill feel like it’ s just —that there is not enough reserves in the system ? Do you feel like you have\na good sense of what ’s going on there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, on the “ how long,” what we ’ve said is that we expect bill\npurchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year. And we ’ve said that\ntemporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of\nJanuary, I believe. Yes , through January.\nIn terms of the causes, so there ’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market\nparticipants and all kinds of analysts. And, you know, one thing is that we t hink we need\nreserves to be back up to the level —the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the\nvarious fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher,\nand that ’s the level in early September. So we ’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that\nplace. That ’s one thing.\nThere are also —it may be —one thing that was surprising about the episode was that\nliquidity didn ’t seem to flow as one might have expected. We had surveyed the banks carefully\nabout what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above\nthat level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.\nThey just —they didn’ t do tha t, and so the question is why. A nd are there things that we can do\nthat would —adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in\nthe system without in any way sacrificing safety and so undness or financial stability? So we ’re\nlooking at those. Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the\nshort term, but those are a range of things that we ’re looking at as well.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions.\nI wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of , what the strongest or most\n\nimportant case is for feeling that you’ ve now taken out adequate insurance. Is it the response\nyou’re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far? Is it\nthe fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit? Or is it\nsomething different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted\nitself, et c etera?\nCHAIR POWELL. Honestly, it ’s really the—there isn ’t any one factor. It’s really the\nwhole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we\nbelieve is the appropriate stance. It ’s really both of those things. Again, if you look at the\nperformance of the economy thr ough this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient. Witness\ntoday’ s GDP report. And it ’s just —again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that\nsector continues to be strong. We know that the manufa cturing, investment , trade , export sector\nhas been weak. That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we ’ve got an economy that is showing\nmoderate growth, and we think that today’ s setting —we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent . That is,\nwe believe, an accommodative level and a level that wi ll support that outlook that we have.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But are you concerned—just to follow up , really . This is kind\nof a one -legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other things —exports,\ninvestment —tha t it’s going t o weaken further at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’ t see any evidence of that. What we see is— what\nwe see is that the consumer sector continues strong. Agai n, low initial claims. It’ s all—the data\nwe monit or, obviously, is a very broad range of data. We also see now, I think, more clearly the\neffects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity. You ’re\nseeing strong durable goods sales. You ’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the\nfirst time in a while —two-tenths, I think , this quarter. And you’ re seeing retail sales— the retail\n\nsales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today’ s release was 2.9 percent . So that ’s\ngood. A nd I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and\nhome buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers ’ incomes rising, and keeping\nconsumer confidence at high levels , where it currently is.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr . Chairman . You were just talking about how t he\nlower rates have affected consumer behavior . Is there a concern that there ’s just less potency on\nthe business investment side that you’ re, in effect, pushing on a string?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I think monetary policy works through the channels that we\nunderstand. I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest- rate-sensitive sectors,\nwhich are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned. I think it ’s—I think interest rates are a\nfactor in business investment, but I don’ t believe they ’re the main factor and main driver . And I\nthink, you know, what one would like to see for —to support greater manufacturing activity,\nbusiness investment, and exports would be a global recovery . And, you know, there ’s a lot of\nmonetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation , maybe , in the global economy\nnow. Not here, but perhaps elsewhere. And that should turn —that should support growth in the\nglobal economy. A nd, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time\nas well.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned\nFed Listens a couple of times, and what you’ ve heard from people there about how it ’s\nbenefited the disadvantaged or lower -income workers —the h ot job market we have. Has the F ed\nthought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens and maybe taking in some of this\ninput from people that you don’ t alw ays hear from —things like the Beige B ook focus on\n\nbusinesses ? Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from com munity groups more\nregularly? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us,\nand I ’m sure we will repeat it . In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review\nwill become institutionalized and be done every few years. I would say this : In the Beige B ook,\nwe talk to educational institutions, health -care institutions, community groups, labor groups —it’s\nnot just businesses. And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of\nour regional banks .\nWe al so meet quite regularly at the B oard with representatives of low - and moderate -\nincome communities . And so we’re —we ’re very conscious of —you know, that we represent all\nAmericans, and we need to hear all of their perspect ives. That ’s why we —you know, we talk\nabout how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about\ngroups that haven’ t experienced that yet . And so we’re —we try to remind ourselves that we\nserve everybody .\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg . You mentioned housing and\ntoday’ s GDP data . When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing\nor are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’ re moving to trend growth for the rest of the\nyear and next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that is —our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around\n2 percent , which is pretty close to trend . That ’s our outlook : could be better , could be worse .\nYou know, it ’s—you never say you’ ve achieved it . But that’ s our outlook. A nd we feel like our\ncurrent stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.\n\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Chair Powell, setting aside market\nexpectations for today’ s rate cut —obviously, 97 percent sort of expected that this would happen\ntoday—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular\nmeeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December , and if there was any\ndiscussion about that around the tab le? Thanks .\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I think this seems to be the right movement . You can see that\nwe had our usual range of perspectives, range of views . But, in the end, we had a strong vote in\nfavor of this action. I strongly believe it ’s the right acti on. I strongly believe that the actions\nwe’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and\nare supporting economic growth and will do so in the future . So—\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. C hairman Powell, it seems\nthat the differences all across the country —that different regions are reacting differently to the\nChina trade, and some regions are much weaker than others. There ’s this urban versus rural\ndivide , the coasts versus the middle of the country . How does that factor into your policy\ndecisions ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it ’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument . So\nwe can ’t—obviously, we can’ t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places. But\nwe’re very conscious . The first thing to know is to understand that , that—and we ’ve called that\nout, as you, I’m sure , know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Report s to Congress . The sort\nof rural –urban disparities in —you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in\nhealth outcomes. You know, i t’s a big and growing difference —set of differences. We don’ t\nreally have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our\neconomy that we may not be —that we might have —may not have the right tools to best address\n\nthem, but we call them out because, you know, we ’re spending all of our time with the economy,\nand those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by—at the\nnational level and at the state level .\nGREG ROBB. Oh, could I follow? Sorry, could I follow ? Could—s orry. Just , so—so\nare you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them to do something down the\nroad?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not asking Congress to do anything right now . I sometimes have\nnoted that it would be appropriate . Let me p ut it this way : We do what we do, which is , we’re\nassigned a job , which is maximum employment and stable prices. We do financial stability . We\ndo bank regulation. The U.S. economy faces significant longer -term challenges around potential\ngrowth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all\nkinds of things . And those are issues for Congress, and they’ re not issues for us. But if you\nreally w ant the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United\nStates, you need—you need proper monetary policy. But, really, it isn ’t monetary policy .\nReally , it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth.\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times . I think you said, Chair Powell, that the\nprimary positive development in risk s to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects\nfor a phase -one agreement with China . But, given the ups and downs of the trade dispute and\nthat, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about\ndeveloping monetary policy guidance, if you will, that ’s dependent a good part on the wins of the\ntrade negotiations ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, I know, t hat’s—I wouldn’ t—that ’s not how I would\ncharacterize it . I would just —I noted that it may be that there ’s been progress there toward —\n\naway from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there ’s the makings of\na possible settlement there. I didn’ t say we ’re baking that in or anything, but I ’m just noting that\nthat’s the case. As with Brexit— it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election\nand what the ultimate result will be . But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no- deal\nBrexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations\nwith China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution . That ’s all I’ m saying.\nDON LEE. If I could follow up, if the phase -one agreem ent, then , doesn’ t work out, then\nwould we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that—\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our\nassessment of the outlook . And if we see—if we have —if we —if things happen that cause us to\nmaterially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, t hen we\nwould act accordingly.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with the Agence France- Presse. T hank you.\nThe Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and\nhow that could be a factor behind sluggish growth. In light of the recent outcome of the strike at\nGeneral Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle\nincomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be .\nI will just say , on the General Motors strike, it’s —it’ s likely to have taken away a couple of\ntenths of growth this quarter. That ’s likely to come back , maybe , over the first half of next year .\nAnd I think it ’s good to see it settled . But I ’m not going to comment on what the appropriate\nlabor arrangements are. That ’s a little bit far afield fro m our task here. Thank you.\n\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires.\n[Inaudible ] Oh, I w as wondering what that was . Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires.\nThank you—t hank you, Chairman. Wondering if you would categorize the current s tance of\nmonetary policy as accommodative, or if it ’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we\nthought at this time last year. Secondly, you know, we ’re now two years removed from the T ax\nCuts and J obs A ct, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before —2 percent.\nSo, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long- term growth, you\nknow, is it fair to say that the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct worked the way it was supposed to?\nThanks .\nCHAIR POWELL. So rry, say again what your first question was ? I wrote it down , I\ncan’t—\nPAUL KIERNAN. Sorry —if policy is accommodative right now .\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah, y es. Okay . So if you look at where the federal funds rate is\ntrading , it should be in the middle of , or maybe the lower half of , the range of 150 to 175. So\nthat means the real rate is probably modestly below zero. I think my own sense would be that\nthat’s somewhat accommodative policy . I would say, though, that there ’s a range of plausible\nestimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such\nestimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process\ncontinues . But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of\npolicy, and an appropriate stance , given the situation we ’re in with continuing downside risks\nand—that I mentioned. So—\nJEAN YUNG. Hi . Jean Yung from Market News. I wanted to ask about financial\nstability risk s. Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing\n\nconcerns over the high level of risky corporate debt . So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around\nthe world, are you more worried about financial stability risk s and reach -for-yield?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time .\nIt’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I ’ve mentioned before . Currently, we don ’t see large\nimbalances. This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the\nones we ’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened .\nSo we have a four -part framework, I ’ll quickly mention . The first is leverage in the\nfinancial system , which is low by historical standards . The second is fundi ng risk, which is the\nrisk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the\nnonbanking financial sector . If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not\nbroadly across a range . We don’ t see bubbles and that kind of thing. And that leaves the fourth,\nwhich is leverage in the nonfinancial sector , and that ’s households and businesses . So with\nhouseholds, again, we don’ t see leverage. We see them actually getting in very good shape\nfinancially in the aggregate. Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially,\nbut in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place . That leaves businesses, which\nis where the issue has been . Leverage among corporations and other form s of business, private\nbusinesses, is historically high. We ’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps .\nSo that’s what I would say, but it ’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our\nframework, and it is something that we ’re pay ing quite a bit of attention to . And it’s been part of\nthe last couple of S hared National C redit exams, and we’ ve been monitoring it carefully and\ntaking appropriate action .\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Have\nthe pr oblems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital\nrequirements for banks are too hi gh? Is that something that the F ed mig ht review?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re—I think, again , I think the most important basic thing is to\nget the level of reserves back up so that —reserves move up and down with some volatility. We\ndon’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September , which is,\nagain, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion . That ’s the main thing, that ’s the first thing . And we ’re\non a path to do that , between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases .\nIn addition to that —in addition to that, we ’re looking at —there are—it ’s a big,\ncomplicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that\nbanks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here. They were well\nabove that, and yet they didn’ t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities\nto do that . That didn’ t happen. So why is that? And so, we ’re doing careful analysis of that .\nYou ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this ? I don ’t\nthink so. I don ’t think that’ s where this goes. I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for\nexample, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing. It used to be a common thing for\nbanks to ha ve intraday liquidity from the F ed, what are called “daylight overdrafts .” That ’s\nsomething we can look at . Also, there are just a few technical t hings that we can look at that\nwould perhaps make the liquidity that we have —which we think is ample in the financial\nsystem —move more freely and be more liquid, if you will . And those are things we would do,\nbut only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability .\nNAOATSU AOYAMA. Thank you very much, Chairman Powell . Naoatsu Aoyama\nfrom the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper . Given this sustained level of low inflation, even\n\nin—even in this country, do you think—so the re seems to be a higher possibility that lower\ninflation expectation s will remain going forward. So do you think a Japan -like situation , or\n“Japanification ” of chronically low inflation and interest rates —the U.S. is getting trapped by the\nJapanification of this situation ? Do you think so?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we —we , of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now\nthe situation in Europe, and we —we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures\naround the world. And we don’ t think we ’re exempt from those . But, of course, if you look at\nour current inflation performance, it hasn’ t been anything like what we ’ve seen in those other\nplaces. But we don’ t think —again, we don’ t think we ’re exempt from those pressures, and we\nare, therefore, st rongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is\nconsistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective . That’s what we ’re committed to, and\nwe’ll use our tools to achieve . So we take —we take the risk very seriously.\nIt’s not —the risk isn ’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent. The risk\nis that what we ’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very\nhard for them to get off . Once inflation expectations start slidin g down, inflation moves down.\nYou have less —interest rates move down as well , because there’ s an inflation component in\ninterest rates . And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to\nhold and really move inflation expectat ions up so that they’ re squarely and firmly anchored at a\nlevel that ’s consistent with 2 percent inflation .\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance . Another type of balance\nsheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch —there was a discussion before\nthat, that maybe we should move —or, rather, the F ed should move to a more neutral balance\nsheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage -backed securities that are on the balance\n\nsheet and maybe replace them with shorter -term T reasuries. Not any—I haven’ t really heard an\nupdate on the composure or the composition of the balance sheet for right now. I ’m just\nwondering if the F ed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect\nto hear something on that .\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s a —it’s an issue, but it ’s not an issue that we’ re\ncurrently working on and —or reaching a decision on or anything like that . The question of the\nlonger -run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a —is a big one, a nd it’s one we ’ll return\nto over time , but not —not imminently .\nVIVIENNE NUNIS. Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we ’re\nseeing the greatest economy in American h istory. I just wondered , as the C hair of America ’s\ncentral bank , what you made of that characterization .\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I ’m going to maintain my longtime practice of not —not\ncommenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you.\nVIVIENNE NUNIS. Okay, thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."
