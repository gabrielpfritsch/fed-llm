I w ant to begin by acknowledging the tremendous\nhardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’ s invasion. The human toll is\ntragic . The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S . economy\nare highly uncertain .\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy\ngoals that Congress has given us: maximum employment a nd price stability . Today, in support\nof these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point . The economy is\nvery strong, and against the backdrop of a n extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the\nCommittee anticipates th at ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be\nappropriate . In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming\nmeeting .\nEconomic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecti ng progress on\nvaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the\nhealthy financial positions of households and businesses . The rapid spread of the Omicron\nvariant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year . But cases hav e declined sharply\nsince mid -January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief. Although the invasion\nof Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue t o foresee solid growth. A s shown in our Summary of Economic\nProjections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year ,\n2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024.\nThe labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first two\nmonths of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs . In February, the\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nunemployment rate hit a post -pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee\nparticipants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level . The improvements in labor market\nconditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution\nas well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued. As a result,\nemployers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years . FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median\nprojection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and\nremaining near that level thereafter.\nInflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent . Aggregate demand is\nstrong, a nd bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond.\nThese supply disruptions have been larger , and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by\nwaves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods\nand services . Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation. The surge in\nprices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine will\nput additional upward pressure on near -term inflation here at home .\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that\nthe best thing we can do to support a s trong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and\nthat is only possible in an environment of price stability. As we emphasize in our policy statement, w ith appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to\nreturn to 2 percen t while the labor market remain s stron g. That said, inflation is likely to take\nlonger to return to our price -stability goal than previously expected. The median inflation\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nprojection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3\npercent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher tha n projected in December, and participants\ncontinue to see risks as weighted to the upside .\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employme nt and stable prices for the American people. Our policy has been adapting\nto the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. As I noted, the Committee\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that\nongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate . The median projection for the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this y ear—a full percentage\npoint higher than projected in December . Over the following two years, the median projection is\n2.8 percent —somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer -run value . Of course, these\nprojections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty\nwhere the economy will be a year or more from now.\nReducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the\nstance of monetary policy . At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good\nprogress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting . In making decisions about interest rates and the\nbalance sheet, we will be mindful o f the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we\nwill use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability .\nAs we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine for\nthe U.S . economy are highly uncertain. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil\nand commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains —which would create spillovers to the U.S . economy through trade\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nand ot her channels. The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to\ntighten credit conditions and affect the real economy .\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the\neconomy often evolves in unexpected ways . We will need to be nimble in responding to\nincoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what\nis already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment . We are attentive to the risks of\npotential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations . The Committee is\ndetermined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability . The American economy is\nvery strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary po licy.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals . Thank you. I\nlook forward to your questions .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions . I\nwonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’ re considering the , you know,\nthe risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’ re\nweighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting “ behind the curve.”\nCHAIR POWELL . So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of\na recession within the next year is not particularly elevated . And why do I say that? Aggregate\ndemand is currently st rong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so . If you look at the labor\nmarket, [you find that it is] also very strong. Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ncontinuing at very high levels . Household and business balance sheets are strong. And so all\nsigns are that this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish —not to say\nwithstand , but certainly flourish —as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy . So\nI guess that ’s how I would say I ’m looking at th at. Of course, the objective is to achieve price\nstability while also sustaining a strong labor market . And that is our overall objective . But we\ndo feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Howard at Reuters .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering, in the SEP s, you have\nquite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent . I’m wondering, how much of that do you feel\nis the result of the Fed’s stiffer -than-expected action here? You talk about monetary policy\noperating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?\nCHAIR POWELL . I don’ t think that’ s a big piece of it, actual ly. I think some of that is\njust an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will\nhit our economy through a number of channels . Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’ re looking\nat higher oil prices, higher commodity prices . It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to\nsome extent . So that ’s part of what moved th ose assessments down . I don’ t think —I mean, I\nthink, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there .\nBut remember, a s well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth . If we think that the\npotential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between , somewhere around 1.75 percent ,\n2.8 percent is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of\nthe last expansion. So , while it’ s lower than last year ’s 5.8 percent , it’s still quite strong growth .\nSo I would say it ’s quite a strong forecast .\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So , in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or\nslower on the rate hikes? “ Ongoing increases ” doesn ’t really tell us whether this is going to\ncome in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year .\nCHAIR POWELL . So, you know, the way we ’re think ing about this is that every\nmeeting is a live meeting . And we ’re going to be looking at evolving conditions . And if we do\nconclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then\nwe’ll do so. I can ’t be perfectly specifi c about it, but that ’s certainly a possibility as we go\nthrough the year .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Rachel at the Washington Post .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Thank you, Michelle . And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions . I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to\ncome down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the\neconomy, and supply chains getting better? And if you don’ t start to see that, how will you\nsignal it? What will you be looking for? And what will you be looking for over the course of\nthe year? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So I guess I would say that at the —before the invasion of Ukraine by\nRussia—so let ’s go back t o that . I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would\npeak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe\nstay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So\nnow we ’re, you know, we ’re getting —we ’re going—we ’re already seeing a little bit of short -\nterm upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not\nso much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices .\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nThe other thing is that you ’re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you\nknow, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods . So that ’s\ngoing to mean more tangled supply chains . So that could actually push out [in time] the relief\nwe were expecting on supply chains generally. So I guess I would say that the expectation i s still\nthat inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year. But if you look at where I\nread the SEP headline median , we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year,\nand then we expect —though, particularly with the effects of the war , but also the data we ’ve\nseen so far this year —we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to\ncome down, and then come down more sharply next year .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Let ’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, over the\nlast six months, the Fed has shifted its policy stance quite a bit. Six months ago, you were still\nbuying assets . Most officials weren ’t projecting any interest rate increases this year . And yet,\ndespite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then . So\nhow concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the\neconomy? Thanks .\nCHAIR POWELL . So that ’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that\nwe—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the\nbalance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to “ the economy is very strong,”\nas I mentioned . Tremendous momentum in the labor market . We expect growth to continue . As\nI—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin th e balance sheet shrinkage.\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nAnd I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’ s meeting, I saw a\nCommittee that’ s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is]\ndetermined to use our tools to do exactly that . You couched it in terms of real rates. I would\nsay, if you look at the SEP, you’ ve got people getting close to or even above , in many cases,\ntheir estimate of the longer- run neutral rate . So I understand that doesn’ t do it for real rates . But\nif you go out a year or two, many people are , in their forecasts , are having tight policy from a\nreal interest rate standpoint.\nSo that ’s something that we ’re focused on. Of course, it ’s a highly uncertain\nenvironment . And, you know, we don’ t know what ’s going to happen. B ut we do know that\nwe’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals —and that includes the price -stability goal.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Let ’s go to Victoria at Politico .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So , looking at the Summary of E conomic\nProjections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent . And\nthen you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be\nestimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that ’s a littl e bit uncertain . So I was just\nwondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the\nFed itself raising rates? And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin\nwithdrew her nomination, what do you e xpect to do with the regulatory portfolio? Do you\nexpect to assign a G overnor in charge of that?\nCHAIR POWELL . Okay , sorry. Tell me again your first question .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. My first question is , how much do you expect inflation to come\ndown as a dire ct result of the Fed ’s actions?\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL . Okay . So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is\nclearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include , potentially , the supply\nchain is getting a little bit better, certain ly base effects. You ’re lapping— as you know, when you\nlook at a 12 -month trailing window, you’ re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May,\nJune of last year . So there should be some effects from that in the 12-month picture . Really\nwhat we ’re looking for, though, is month- by-month inflation coming down. And so it ’s really ,\nit’s all the things we’ ve been talking about, you know, that really haven’ t helped much , including\nthe shift away from goods and back to services , including supply chains getting better , including\nlabor force participation —all those things that have been sticky and not happening. But a big\npart of it is, though, is the base effects I mentio ned as well .\nYou know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag,\nof course . And so you would see that more in ’23 and ’ 24. But also , remember we started\ntalking about rate increases last year. For some months now , financial conditions have already\nincorporated a significant number of rate increases . So it doesn’ t start today . The effect, the\nmoves are already priced into the market for a few months now . So the clock is running on that,\nand I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well .\nSo on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this . You know, we have an obligation to\ncarry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we ’re doing that . That ’s what we ’re\ndoing. The committ ee is not active . So what ’s happening is , things are coming to the full Board,\nand we ’re voting on them . We’ re getting our business done . You know, we got the stress test s\ndone . We’ ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that . So\nwe’re working ahead. Of course, we don’ t have a Vice C hair for Supervision, as you mentioned.\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nBut we ’re making do with the situation we have . And a good number of things have come\nstraight to the Board for approval .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Let ’s go to Neil Irwin at Axios . [Pause] Let ’s go to Neil Irwin .\nNEIL IRWIN . Hi, Chair Powell. It ’s Neil Irwin at Axios . Thanks for taking our\nquestions . In the s tatement of e conomic p rojections, we see a forecast of median 1.9 percent fed\nfunds rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year . Wonder ed whether that aligns with your\nown expectations , in particular on that point of overshooting the long- term neutral rate . And,\nalso, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced: front -loaded, back- loaded. H ow\nhigh is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I don’ t—Neil, I ’ve never talked about my own SEP projection.\nIt’s in there , but I , you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that , because we just\nhaven’ t done it . It’s because we’ re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the\nCommittee and present that consensus. So I wouldn’ t talk about my individual one .\nAnd in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is —there ’s seven\nremaining meetings this year . This isn ’t something we discuss or debate or agree on . But there ’s\nseven remaining meetings, and there ’s seven rate hikes. I would add there ’s also the shrinkage\nof the balance sheet , which , you people do the math different ways, but that might be the\nequivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet . So I don’ t—but I\ndon’t know . We haven ’t made any decisions on front -end loading or going steadily through the\nyear.\nAnd, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do\nsee more than seven or eight increases this year . And I can’ t give you, I ’m not going to try to\ngive you a really specific test for what it would take to do that . But I will say this, that we ’ll be\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nlooking at the data as they come in. We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected\nimprovement on inflation . We’ ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement .\nAnd we ’ll be going—each meeting is a li ve meeting . And if we conclude that it would be\nappropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ ll do so.\nMICHELLE SMITH . [Long pause] One second . Okay . We’ re going to try one more\ntime. Colby Smith at the FT. [Long pause] Okay . We’ ll come back to Colby. Let ’s go to\nEdward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Ye s. Thank you, Chair Powell . Thank you, Michelle, for the\nquestion. I have a more basic question . The last time the CPI inflation —I know you look at\nPCE, but CPI inflation— was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds\nrate was 19.2 percent . But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you\nbelieve the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I just would say a couple things . We have the tools that we need,\nand we ’re going to use them . And , as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to\nraise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet . We wi ll take the necessary steps\nto ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor\nmarket. And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we’ll do so. I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the\nrecord on this . What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible] —\nCHAIR POWELL . We l ost you in the middle of the question .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Edward, can you repea t that question?\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . —t he impact that —given you’ re not actually confirmed and\nGovernor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s\nability to handle inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL . None whatsoever .\nMICHE LLE SMITH . Okay, let ’s go to Colby Smith at the FT.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle . Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee\nabout the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self -correct? And\nto what extent does it alter both the Committee ’s confidence that long- term inflation expectations\nwill not de -anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to\nraise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Thank you. So , of course , that’s something we ’re watching report by\nreport . And we ’re certainly , we noticed it in the last meeting . And it ’s part of the overall\npicture . We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that ’s part of\nwhat ’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they\nwere before the crisis. In other cases, it ’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly\nacross services. And, yes, that is concerning . In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the\ngood side . But, really , in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is , admittedly , a\nlarge category . So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligati on to\nmove to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Steve Liesman at CNBC .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Thank you. Mr . Chairman , I wonder if you can help me understand\nthe kind o f logic , if there is one , in the SEP here . As I look at the median forecast, for example,\nfor unemployment, it runs for the three -year window below the long- run rate . I look at inflation\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nbeing above , over the three -year window , the long- run—or call it th e neutral —rate, so the\neconomy still runs hot . And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the\nfunds rate above the long- run rate .\nI guess my question is this: Are you not create —giving a forecast here that essentially\nsuggests you will be continuing to run further “ behind the curve ”—and never really get in front\nof inflation , because the economy will continue to run hot? And, kind of on a related issue : You\nsaid earlier [that] inflati on will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally\nexpected . Isn’t that a choice you ’re making? And, if so, why are you making that choice to let\ninflation run above price stability longer than you ’d like?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So o ur, if you look, our —first of all, there is no —you’ re\nlooking at medians . But understand that there ’s no, it’s not something we voted on. It’ s not a\nplan. But if you look, people do have their in —by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or\nclose to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer -run neutral interest rate . Okay . So\nthat should stop pushing —that should, in other words, that should be a removal of\naccommodation for monetary policy, basically . At the same time, we will have done significant\nbalance sheet runoff . And you can think of that as further .\nIn the next year , and just looking at the median, you’ re now above the , you know, above\nthe, what people estimate to be the longer -run median. A nd also, in many people ’s forecasts,\nthat actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under , in real rates as well . So why does\nunemployment remain at 3.5 percent ? You know, it—I mean, a couple points . One is the\nconnection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between\ninflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nBut this is —clearly , what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that , the idea\nthat wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the\nlong run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive,\nfull-economy kind of —full -employment kind of wages , but not to a point where they ’re pushing\nup inflation anymore . And , as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come\ndown. And, you know, the reality is , there are many, many moving pieces , and we don’ t know\nwhat will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a C ommittee that is determined to\nuse its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched . And so we are\ndetermined on that front, and we ’ll deal with what comes . This is a modal , or most likely ,\nexpectation. But we ’ll deal with what comes, whether it ’s better or worse .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Chris Rugaber at the AP .\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER . Hi. Thank you. Well, let me follow up a bit on that. I\nmean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you ’ve\npenciled in without raising the unemployment rate . And I ’m wondering, just what are the\nmechanisms you see in reducing demand? I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed\n[funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it ’s through higher unemploym ent? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, if you take a look at today’ s labor market, what you have is\n1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that ’s a very, very tight labor market —\ntight to an unhealthy level, I would say. So, in principle, if you were —let ’s say that our tools\nwork about as you described, and the idea is, we ’re trying to better align demand and supply,\nlet’s just say in the labor market. S o it would actually, if you were just moving down the number\nof job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nwages. You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the\neconomy.\nWe’re hearing from companies that they can ’t hire enough people . They ’re having a hard\ntime hiring . So that ’s really the thinking there , is, you know, these are fairly well -understood\nchannels, interest sensitive. And , basically , across the economy, we’ d like to slow demand so\nthat it’ s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a\nbetter, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand. And that , over time , should bring\ninflation down.\nAnd I ’ll say again, though, you know, we don’ t have a perfect crystal ball about the\nfuture, a nd we ’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability . You know, as I\nmentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there —you really can ’t have a\nsustained period of maximum employment . It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is\nto maintain and restore, in this case, price stability . So we ’re very committed to that . Of course,\nthe plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention , and we believe we can do that . But we have to restore price stability .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Let ’s go to Scott Horsley at NPR .\nSCOTT HORSLEY . Thanks . And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground\nyou just talked about, Mr . Chair . I think I missed some of your answer there . But I have a\nfollow -up question on the labor force . We have seen some gains in the prime- age workforce in\nthe last few months . I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers\nas the health outlook has changed. Are we goin g to see more recent retirees following Tom\nBrady back into the workforce? And what would that mean for wages and inflation?\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL . It’s hard to say . You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that,\nover the course of a long, steady expansion, l abor force participation outperformed expectations .\nAnd that was just a , you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn’ t—it was nowhere near as\ntight as this labor market . But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force\nlonger . It wasn ’t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement. That ’s not\nsomething that happens , in the aggregate , very much. But , so that ’s what was happening.\nAnd, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome . And, of\ncourse, our policy does not in any way preclude that . This is a situation where wages have\nmoved up at the highest rate in a very long time . And people are able to quit their jobs and move\nto better -paying jobs in the same industry or different indus tries. So it ’s a really attractive labor\nmarket for people . And once , you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an\neven more attractive one . So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply . That ’s a good\nthing for the country. It ’s a good thing for people .\nAnd it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation\nmore at risk . That last part is , we’ll have to see whether , empirically , it winds up, works out that\nway. But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well. It’s not the only thing we ’re\nlooking for, though, from inflation. We’re looking for help from a number of different places\nand, most importantly, from our own policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Let ’s go to Rich Miller at Bloomb erg.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you, Michelle . And thank you, Chair Powell . I’m sorry; I ’m\nhaving some communication problems . So I missed some of the stuff you ’ve said , and m y\napologies if this has been asked . Since the FOMC met last January, financial condi tions have\ntightened markedly, equity price s down, T reasury yield ’s up, bond spread ’s risen, yield curve has\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nflattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar ’s up. Is that welcome? And would you like to\nsee more in order to achieve your goals? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions . That ’s\nhow it reaches the real economy —by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that\nthe financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very\naggressive , and appropriately so, fiscal policy , but also highly accommodative monetary\npolicy— the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic . So\nit is very appropriate to move away from thos e.\nAnd, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher\ninterest rates and just the sorts of things —we ’re not targeting any one or more of those things,\nbut financial conditions generally should move to a more normal le vel so that —because we\nknow the economy no longer needs , or wants , these very highly accommodative, this stance,\nwhich , you know, so it ’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we\ndo that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels.\nRICH MILLER. When you say “ move to a more normal setting ” for financial\nconditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where\nwe are now . Am I drawing the right inference from that?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, yes. So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial\nconditions . And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust\nin sync over time with monetary policy. It’ s not any particular financial condition, but a broad\nrange of financial conditions . They will reflect to some extent —they reflect any number of\nthings . But, yes , we need our policy to transmit to the real economy. And it does so through\nfinancial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nit’s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less\naccommodative .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Just a little housekeeping note : Those of you in this\ncall may be having some tech issues. If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly\non . You might go there for the audio. And now we ’ll go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you\nhad at this meeting . Can you give us any more details? Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs\nor whether to increase those caps over what period , if there were any details?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes . Thank you for asking. So, at our meeting today and yesterday,\nwe made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance\nsheet . And I ’d say we ’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll\nactually begin a runoff at a coming meeting. And that could come as soon as our next meeting in\nMay. That ’s not a decision that we ’ve made . But I would say that that ’s how well our\ndiscussions went in the last two days .\nSo a couple things just to add. We’ ll be mindful of the bro ader financial and economic\ncontext when we make the decision on timing, a nd we always want to use our tools to support\nmacroeconomic and financial stability . We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what ’s a highly\nuncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this .\nIn terms of the —I would say this . I don ’t want to get too much into the details , because\nwe’re literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people\nwho are familiar with the last time we did this . But it ’ll be faster than the last time . And, of\ncourse, it ’s much sooner in a cycle than last time . But it will look familiar to you . And I would\nalso say that there ’ll be—I’m sure there’ ll be a more detailed discussion of our —in the minutes\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nto our meeting that come out in three weeks , where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty\nmuch the parameters of what we ’re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ ve been operating on\na monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down. That\nseems to be over . But I ’m wondering how you would de scribe your reaction function now .\nWhat is it that the F ed is trying to do other than bring inflation down? In other words, is it , we’re\ngoing to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?\nCHAIR POWELL . Ye s. So I want to clear one t hing up again. A nd that is that nothing\nin our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates . What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of\nwhat had happened for the prec eding couple of decades, actually . What we said was, if we see,\nyou know, low unemployment, high employment , but we don’ t see inflation, then we ’re not\ngoing to raise rates ’ til we actually see inflation . That’s what we said, and that was the sense of\nit. There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates. That ’s simply not in the framework . In fact, quite the contrary . The framework is all\nabout anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent .\nSo I d o hear this, you know, that the framework —really, we can ’t blame the framework .\nIt was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation. And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was . But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework. So , come to today.\nYou know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear . What we see is a\nstrong labor market . We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation . And we\nsee the underlying economy’s strong. Balance sheets are strong . Yes, there are threats to growth\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nfrom, you know, from what ’s going on in Eastern Europe . And, but, nonetheless, in the base\ncase, there ’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth.\nBut inflation is far above our target. And, you know, the help we ’ve been expecting and\nother forecasters have been expecting from supply -side improvement, labor force participation,\nbottlenecks, all those things getting better —it hasn ’t come . And so we ’re looking now to using\nour tools to restore price s tability, and we ’re committed to doing that . And you see that, I think,\nin the S ummary of E conomic P rojections . And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ ll\ncontinue to see it in the decisions we make , going forward.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’ d call it i s the\n“Paul Volcker ” question : You don’ t think unemployment is going to rise significantly , but, if it\ndoes, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?\nCHAIR POWELL . The goal, of course, is t o restore price stability while also sustaining\na strong labor market. We have a dual mandate, and they ’re sort of equal . But , as I said earlier,\nyou know, price stability is an essential goal . In fact, it ’s a precondition, really, for achieving the\nkind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market . We saw the\nbenefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market . It pulled people back in, and there were\nreally no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansi on. It, just , the pandemic\narrived ; it was just a completely exogenous event . So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it .\nWe, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market . But\nwe do understand also that, really, you can’ t have maximum employment for any sustained\nperiod without price stability . So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the\nlabor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle\ntighter monetary policy .\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chair Powell . Hopefully no tech issues here on this front .\nWanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the F ed’s\ndoing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or\nunderstanding what the SEP is . How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on\nfuture F ed policy going to address the inflation that they ’re feeling at the sto res on a daily basis?\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure . So I guess I ’d start by just assuring everyone that we ’re fully\ncommitted to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people ’s well -\nbeing. And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone . But it ’s really , especially , on people\nwho use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where —I\nmean, we ’ve all seen charts that show, if you’ re a middle -income person, you’ ve got room to\nabsorb some inflation. If you’ re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’ s very hard because\nyou’re spending most of your money already on necessities , and the price is going up .\nBut it’ s punishing for everyone . So it has been a difficult time for the economy . But we\ndo anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier . It may take longer than\nwe like, but I ’m confident that we ’ll use our tools to bring inflation down. You asked about\nrates. So the way that works , I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually\nslow down demand for the interest -sensitive parts of the economy . And so what we would see is\ndemand slowing down, but just enough so that it ’s better match ed with supply. And that\nbrings —that will bring inflation down over time . That’s our plan.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News .\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nJO LING KENT . Hi, Chair Powell . Thank you so much fo r taking my question during\nthis today . My question is a follow -up to what Brian just asked . What is your message to\nconsumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, that is —yes, indeed . I mean, as I just said, you know, I think\nwe do understand very much, and we very much take to heart , that it’ s our obligation to restore\nprice stability . And, you know, we ’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come\nto take it for granted . But now we see the pain . I’m old enough to remember what very high\ninflation was like . And, you know, we ’re strongly committed as a C ommittee to not allowing\nthis higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to\nmore nor mal levels, which —our target is 2 percent inflation . So we will do that .\nAnd I just would want people to understand that, and that ’s—but the way we do that is by\nraising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet . And so financial conditions will\nbecome, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity. That will slow the\neconomy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong . And, you know, the good\nnews is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong . And that means the economy, we\nthink, can handle interest rate increases.\nJO LING KENT . And as a quick follow -up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal\nReserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession. For the consumers\nout there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I , you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back\ndown to 2 percent , while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very\nstrong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that ’s strong within the\ncontext of U .S. potential economic output . So—and we expect that to continue . And to the\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nextent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt . But we do believe that\nour policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down\ninflation . We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market .\nThe labor market is —it’s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word. We have not seen\na labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every une mployed person or where there , if\nyou add job openings to those who are employed, that ’s actually substantially a larger number\nthan the size of the workforce , than the number of people who actually count themselves as in\nthe workforce . So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply. And when that\nhappens, prices go up. And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.\nAnd we don ’t think we need to do this alone . There will be other factors helping that happen.\nBut we cer tainly are prepared to use our tools —and we will .\nJO LING KENT . Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Simon at the Economist .\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Hi . Thank you, Michelle . Thank you, Chair Powell . Sorry\nto take you away from inflation for one minute . May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and ,\nspecifically , the freezing of the central bank assets ? Of course, that raises a similar risk for other\nsovereigns around the world and their biggest companies , potentially. Any conce rns about , in\nthe long term, how this might affect the dollar ’s status as the preeminent global reserve\ncurrency ? And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds of reassurance to\nother central bankers around the world?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally\nvery in favor of these sanctions . But let me say this: S anctions are really the business of the\nelected government, and that ’s true everywhere . So the A dministration and the Treasury\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nDepartment, in particular, and other agencies —they create these sanctions. We’ re there to\nprovide technical expertise, but they’ re not , it’s not our decisions . And so I ’m reluctant to\ncomment on sanctions really much because, again, they ’re not for us [to decide]. We have a very\nspecific mandate. And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned . So\nI’d have to leave it at that . Sorry .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL- GENZER. Hi, Chair Powel l. Thanks for taking the question.\nYou’ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great thing, but are we\npossibly seeing the beginning of a wage –price spiral?\nCHAIR POWELL . So the way I would say i t is this: We, first of all, I would agree with\nthe premise that wages moving up is a great thing. You know, that ’s how the standard of living\nrises over time. And , generally , it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what\nwe have now, if you look at these , the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we ’re blessed\nwith a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now, they’ re all\nshowing the same thing, which is that the increases —not the levels , but the i ncreases—are\nrunning at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal ,\nover time . And that may be —we don’ t know how persistent that phenomenon will be . It’s very\nhard to say.\nAnd that ’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage –price spiral; is that\nsomething that ’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system ? We don ’t see\nthat. You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those\nwage i ncreases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level . But it comes back to,\nyou know, what I ’m saying here —which is , there ’s a misalignment of demand and supply,\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nparticularly in the labor market. And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time . And so we need to use our tools to, you know,\nguide inflation back down to 2 percent . And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily\nstrong labor market . We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary\npolicy. And the overall economy can as well .\nBut, ye s, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it ’s\ngood to see that moving up. But it wouldn’ t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them\nmoving up that much higher . And that ’s because of this misalignment between supply and\ndemand. We expect to get more labor supply . We did last time . We got more than we expected\nduring the last cycle . This time, we ’ve gotten much less than expected . So it’s not easy to\npredict these things . But we do expect that we ’ll get people coming back in the labor market,\nparticularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’ s lives, something we\nall wish . But , so that ’s how we think about it .\nMICHELL E SMITH . Thank you. For the last question, we ’ll go to Don Lee at the L .A.\nTimes .\nDON LEE . Hi, Chair Powell. I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in\nhindsight, the F ed should have moved earlier . And it sounds like today that you don’ t think that\nthe F ed is late . And , just wanted to get your clarification on that . And if it is, if you still think\nthat the Fed is “behind the curve,” how much “ behind the curve ” is it?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So w e are not —we don’ t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight\nin actually implementing real -time decisions in the world . So, you know, so the question is —the\nright question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time? But\nthat’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now . So I think if we\n\nMarch 16, 20 22 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nknew now —of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages , really , and the inflation\nresulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we kne w that that was\nwhat was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes . It would have been appropriate to move\nearlier . Obviously, it would be . But, again, we don’ t have that luxury .\nAnd then, so , but that ’s a separate question from your other question, which is “ behind\nthe curve .” And, you know, I don’ t have the luxury of looking at it that way. You know, we are ,\nwe have our tools —powerful tools —and the Committee is very focused on using them . We’ re\nacutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market . And\nwhat I saw today was a C ommittee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in\nparticular, and prepared to use our tools to do that . We’ re not going to let high inflation become\nentrenched . The costs of that would be too high. And we ’re not going to wait so long that we\nhave to do that . No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get\ninflation back down.\nSo, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates b ack up to more neutral\nlevels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be\nappropriate . And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense t hat, [in] people ’s [contributions\nto the] SEPs , they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the\nlonger -run neutral rate . And there ’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at\nthe details of the SEP . But thanks for your question.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Thank you all . Thanks, Mr . Chair .\nCHAIR POWELL . Thank you."
