  "text": "Page \nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. The Federa l Open Market Committee concluded its\nmeeting earlier today and, as usual, released it s monetary policy statement. The Committee also\nreleased a document describing the approach the Committee intends to take when, at some point\nin the future, it becomes appropriate to be gin normalizing the stance of policy. Let me\nunderscore that our release of this information is not meant to convey any change in the stance of\npolicy. As you know, the FOMC’s views on policy are conveyed in the policy statement, which\nI will now discuss before coming back to our normalization plans.\nAs indicated in our policy statement, the FO MC decided to make another reduction in the\npace of its asset purchases. The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the\nfederal funds rate target and rea ffirmed its view that a highly ac commodative stance of monetary\npolicy remains appropriate. Let me discuss the economic conditions that underpin these actions.\nThe economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum\nsustainable employment. In the labor market , conditions have improved further in recent\nmonths. Although the pace of job growth has sl owed some recently, job gains have averaged\nmore than 200,000 per month over the past th ree months. The unemployment rate was\n6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at the time of the June FOMC\nmeeting. Broader measures of labor market u tilization, such as the U-6 measure, have shown\nsimilar improvement, and the labor force part icipation rate has flattened out. These\ndevelopments continue the trend of gradual progr ess toward our employment objective. But the\nlabor market has yet to fully recover. There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot\nfind them, too many who are working part time but would prefer full-ti me work, and too many\nwho are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market we re stronger. As noted in the\n\nPage FOMC statement, “a range of labor market indica tors suggests that there remains significant\nunderutilization of labor resources.”\nThe Committee continues to see sufficient und erlying strength in the economy to support\nongoing improvement in the labor market. Althou gh real GDP rose at an annual rate of only\nabout 1 percent in the first half of the year, that modest gain reflect ed, in part, transitory factors,\nincluding a dip in net exports . Indeed, private domestic demand—that is, spending by\ndomestic households and businesse s—grew about twice as fast as GDP. Indicators of spending\nand production for the third quarter suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate\npace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward.\nInflation has been running below the Committ ee’s 2 percent objective, but with longer-\nterm inflation expectations appearing to be we ll anchored and the economic recovery continuing,\nthe Committee expects inflation to move gradua lly back toward its ob jective. Moreover,\ninflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Co mmittee believes that the likelihood\nof inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished. As is always the case, the\nCommittee will continue to assess incoming data careful ly to ensure that policy is consistent with\nattaining the FOMC’s longer-run goals of maxi mum employment and inflation of 2 percent.\nThis outlook is reflected in the individua l economic projections submitted in conjunction\nwith this meeting by the FOMC participants , which, for the first time, go through 2017. As\nalways, each participant’s projections are cond itioned on his or her own view of appropriate\nmonetary policy. The central tendency of the une mployment rate projections is slightly lower\nthan in the June projections and now stands at 5.9 to 6.0 percent at th e end of this year.\nCommittee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level over the course of 2016 a nd edging a bit below that level in 2017. The central tendency of\n\nPage the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June\nprojections. Over the next three years, the proj ections for real GDP growth run somewhat above\nthe estimates of longer-run normal growth. Finally, FOMC participants con tinue to see inflation\nmoving gradually back toward 2 percent. The ce ntral tendency of the inflation projections is\n1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017.\nAs I noted earlier, the Committee decided today to make another reduction in the pace of\nasset purchases. Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and prog ress in lowering it was expected to be much\nslower than desired without a dditional policy accommodation. The intent of the program was to\nachieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation\nwas moving back toward the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent. In light of the\ncumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor\nmarket conditions since the inception of the progr am, and with the likelihood of inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset\npurchases again at this meeti ng. Starting next month, we w ill be purchasing $15 billion of\nsecurities per month, down $10 billion per month fr om our current rate. If incoming information\nbroadly supports the Committee’ s expectation of ongoing improveme nt in the labor market and\ninflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting.\nThe Committee will continue its policy of re investing proceeds fr om maturing Treasury\nsecurities and principal payments from holdings of agency debt and MBS. The Committee’s\nsizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial\n\nPage conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and\ninflation of 2 percent.\nRegarding interest rates, the Committee rea ffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely\nwill be appropriate to maintain the current ta rget range for the federal funds rate for a\nconsiderable time after the asset purchase prog ram ends, especially if projected inflation\ncontinues to run below the Committee’s 2 per cent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored.” This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of\nrealized and expected progress toward its obj ectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of\nlabor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and infl ation expectations, and readings\non financial developments. Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the\nCommittee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-\nconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for so me time, warrant keeping the target federal\nfunds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\nThis guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the\nparticipants’ projections. As I will explain in a moment, the FOMC now anticipates that it will\ncontinue to establish a target range, rather than a single point, for the federal funds rate when\nnormalization begins, and the dots in the chart I’ve distributed now show, for each participant,\nthe midpoint of this target range. Notably, al though the central tenden cy of the unemployment\nrate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimat ed longer-run value, and the central tendency for\ninflation is close to our 2 percen t objective, the median projection fo r the federal funds rate at the\nend of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a pe rcentage point below the longer-run value of\n3¾ percent or so projected by mo st participants. Although FOMC participants provide a number\n\nPage of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its longer-run normal level at that time,\nmany cite the residual effects of the financia l crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are\nlikely to continue to restrain household spe nding, constrain credit availability, and depress\nexpectations for future growth in output and inco mes. As these factors dissipate further, most\nparticipants expect the federal funds rate to m ove close to its longer-run normal level by the end\nof 2017.\nLet me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectations for the path of the federal\nfunds rate are contingent on the economic outlook. If the economy proves to be stronger than\nanticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and\ninflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate are likely to occur\nsooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged. Conversely, if economic performance\ndisappoints, increases in the federal funds rate are likely to take place later and to be more\ngradual.\nLet me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” This\nstatement is intended to provide information to the public about the eventual normalization\nprocess; it does not signal a change in the curr ent or future stance of monetary policy. As is\nalways the case in setting policy, the FOMC will determine the timing and pace of policy\nnormalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\nSince the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation\nusing nontraditional tools of monetary policy. The FOMC’s intention has always been to return\nto a more traditional approach, and throughout th is period, the Committee ha s been preparing for\nthe normalization process. In June 2011, the Co mmittee set out some broad principles and some\n\nPage more specific tactics for how it e nvisioned the normalization process to take place. In June 2013,\nwe noted that conditions had ch anged significantly in ways not anticipated in June of 2011,\nincluding the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet, a nd that some revision of those\nearlier plans was appropriate. The document released today reflects our updated plans, which,\nreaders of our minutes will know, have been unde r discussion for the last few FOMC meetings.\nThe new approach retains many broad objectives a nd principles from the original but also has\nsome new elements.\nAs was the case before the crisis, the Committ ee intends to adjust the stance of monetary\npolicy during normalization primarily through acti ons that influence the level of the federal\nfunds rate and other short-term interest rates, not through active management of the balance\nsheet. The federal funds rate will serve as the ke y rate to communicate the stance of policy. To\nbegin normalization, the Committee will raise its ta rget range for the federal funds rate. The\nCommittee expects that the effectiv e federal funds rate may vary within the targ et range, and\ncould even move outside of that range on occas ion, but such movements should have no material\neffect on financial conditions or the broader economy.\nThe primary tool for moving the federal funds rate into the target range will be the rate of\ninterest paid on excess reserves, or IOER. The Committee expects that the federal funds rate will\ntrade below the IOER rate while reserves are so plentiful, as is the case at present. The\nCommittee also intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreemen t facility, which, by\ntransacting with a broad set of c ounterparties, will help ensure that the federal funds rate remains\nin the target range. I would like to emphasize that the overnight RRP facility will only be used to\nthe extent necessary and will be phased out when no longer needed to help control the federal\nfunds rate. In addition, the Committee will adjust th e particular settings of these tools as needed,\n\nPage and could deploy other supplementary tools as well, to ensure that we achieve our desired stance\nof policy.\nTurning now to our plans regarding the Fed’ s balance sheet, the Committee intends to\nreduce securities holdings in a gradual and predic table manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest\nrepayments of principal on securi ties held in the System Open Market Account. Regarding the\ntiming for ceasing reinvestments, the Committee now expects this to occur after the initial\nincrease in the target range for the federa l funds rate. The Committee currently does not\nanticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process,\nalthough limited sales might be warranted in th e longer run to reduce or eliminate residual\nholdings. The timing and pace of such sales wo uld be communicated to the public in advance.\nIt’s the Committee’s intention th at the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more\nsecurities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these\nsecurities will primarily cons ist of Treasury securities.\nAs I stated earlier, today’ s release of the Committee’s upda ted normalization plans is in\nno way intended to signal a change in the stance of monetary policy. Rather, it is meant simply\nto provide information about how the Committee e nvisions the normalization process in light of\nthe changes in economic and financial circumstances that have occurred since we put forth our\noriginal plans more than three years ago. That said, conditions could change further, and we will\nlearn about our tools during norma lization. The Committee has agreed that it is prepared to\nmake additional adjustments to its normalizatio n plans if warranted by economic and financial\ndevelopments.\nThank you. Let me stop there. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n\nPage STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Chair Yellen, there was some debate going into this\nmeeting about the phrase “considerable time,” and whether it would remain in the statement. I\nwant to know if you could tell me just a couple things about it. First, was it debated at the\nFOMC as to whether or not it should be includ ed? And, I’m sorry, we’ve been over this before,\nbut what does it mean timewise? And that’s just two questions. I have ju st a couple more here.\nIs the statement a form of forward guidance? An d, finally, how do you square this idea of a date\nwhen you and others on the FOMC have continuous ly said that you’re data dependent to the\npoint where, if the data were to turn, would it not necessarily be a considerable time until you\nraise rates? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, of cour se, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today,\nand it discusses what the appropria te forward guidance is at every meeting. This is part of our\nassessment of economic conditions and the appropri ate stance of monetary policy. In terms of\nwhat the term “considerable time” means, th e Committee decided that, based on its assessment\nof economic conditions, that charac terization remains appropriate, a nd it was comfortable with it.\nI think if you look, for example, at the projections of individual participants that are revealed in\nthe SEP—well, that’s the view of each participant, and, again, I’d emphasize, not a Committee\ncollective view—there is relatively little cha nge in the assessment of the outlook by participants\nbetween this meeti ng and the assessment in June. So th e outlook is little changed—a slight\ndecline in the anticipated path of the unemploymen t rate and a very slight uptick in the inflation\nprojection, but really quite minimal. So, the ou tlook hasn’t changed that much from June, and\nthe Committee felt comfortable with this characterization.\nNow, you said, “Isn’t this calendar-based guida nce?” I want to emphasize that there is no\nmechanical interpretation of what the term “considerable time” means. And, as I’ve said\n\nPage repeatedly, the decisions that th e Committee makes about what is th e appropriate time to begin to\nraise its target for the federal funds rate will be data de pendent. And in my opening comments\njust now, I again emphasized something I’ve said prev iously, which is that if the pace of progress\nin achieving our goals were to quicken, if it we re to accelerate, it’s likely that the Committee\nwould begin raising its target fo r the federal funds rate sooner th an is now anticipated and might\nraise—might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace. And the opposite is also true, if\nthe projection were to change. So there is no fi xed mechanical interpreta tion of a time period.\nI think it would not be accura te to describe the Committee’ s guidance about the timing of\nthe federal funds rate and when it will move a bove zero as being calendar based. The Committee\nhas started with a broad general statement of wh at determines how long it will keep the federal\nfunds rate target at zero. It has said that it will be looking at the actual and projected pace at\nwhich the gaps between our employment and infl ation, and our goals for those variables, are\nclosing. And then what the Committee does at ea ch meeting is—after saying that the assessment\nwill take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and\nother things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the im plications of its view\nof the data at that time. And that assessmen t really hasn’t change d over the last several\nmeetings. The Committee, based on its assessmen t at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying\nthat, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to\nmaintain the current target range for a consider able time after the asset purchase program ends,\nespecially if inflation remains below the 2 percen t objective. So I wouldn’ t describe that as—I\nknow “considerable time” sounds like it’s a calendar concept, but it is highly conditional, and it’s\nlinked to the Committee’s assessment of the economy.\n\nPage HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Sc hneider with Reuters. Thank you. So\nif you would help us, I mean, square the circle a little bit—because havi ng kept the guidance the\nsame, having referred to signi ficant underutilization of labor, having actually pushed GDP\nprojections down a little b it, yet the rate path gets steeper and seems to be consolidating higher—\nso if it’s data dependent, what accounts for the fa ster projections on rate increases if the data\naren’t moving in that direction?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, the grow th projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the\nunemployment path is also marginally lower. So while the projected path of the labor market—\nunemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the\ngrowth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on th e growth outlook. And the Committee assesses\nthat the labor market is conti nuing to improve, and you see a sma ll reduction in the path of the\nunemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period.\nSo, if you ask me—you asked me, “Why has the projected funds rate path moved up?”\nWell, you know, each participant knows the reason th ey wrote down what they did. But, as a\nguess, I would hazard—first, I woul d say, there is relatively little upward movement in the path,\nand I would view it as broadly in line with what one would expect with a very small downward\nreduction in the path for unemployment and a very slight upward change in the projection for\ninflation. So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says,\nhow large is the gap between pe rformance of the labor market and that associated with our\nmaximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent\nobjective, how fast will those gaps change. And you see in the projections very modest\nreductions in the size of those gaps and modest—ve ry small change of a slightly faster pace at\nwhich those gaps would change. I would describe the change in the projections, both for the\n\nPage economy and the path of rates, as quite modest. But the fact that they move does illustrate the\ndata-dependence principle that I think is really so important for market participants to keep in\nmind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold. There is uncertainty about that. And\nas expectations and the actual performance of the economy change, you should expect to see\nmovements in the dots.\nI think it’s also notable that the further you go out in the projection period, the wider the\nset of dots. You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part , different forecasts by\ndifferent members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be. What you don’t see in\nthe dot—so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty that each individual, each participant, sees\naround their own projection. So things will de pend on how the economy evolves. That will\nchange over time, and there’s a good deal of uncertainty a ssociated with it.\nCHRIS CONDON. Thank you, Madam Chai r. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.\nMadam Chair, the economy has been growing now for five years, and some economists believe\nthe expansion will last another five years. W hy, in your view, is economic growth not creating\nmore inflation in wages and in PCE? Is this al l about remaining slack in the labor market, or are\nthere other forces at play?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, to my mi nd, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect\nslack in the labor market. We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the\naftermath of a very significant financial cr isis. We’ve faced headwinds in the economy\nrecovering, so the recovery has be en slow. Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five\nyears. But it’s nevertheless been slow relative to past recoveries that have not been associated\nwith financial crises. And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most\n\nPage FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent.\nSo there is significant underutilizat ion of labor resources. We continue to discuss whether or not\nthe unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor\nresources there really is. And, as I went into de tail in Jackson Hole and w on’t repeat all of that\nthere, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down\nonly very marginally of part-time employ ment for economic—or involuntary part-time\nemployment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of la bor force participation as a result of cyclical\nfactors. And so, I think there still is—and the statement says it—“significant underutilization of\nlabor resources” and a very modest pace of wage in creases that’s picked up very little, I see as\nessentially a reflection of that.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, I want\nto come back to the interest rate projections that the Fed put out today. The public, I think,\nwould be enlightened by knowing a bit more about where you stand in relation to these\nprojections. And with that in mind, and in th e name of transparenc y, I wonder if you could\ndescribe to us whether you’re at the low end of those projections, within the central tendency, or\nat the high end. I also want to ask you about a San Francisco Fed paper that came out recently,\nwhich suggested that market expectations have been running below the Fed’s own projections.\nSo I wanted to ask you if you see that as well, and whether it’s at all troubling that market\nexpectations might not be aligned with the central—with what the Fed put out today.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, with respect to id entifying myself, the Committee has had\ndiscussions during the years that we have been pr oviding these forecasts of the participants to the\npublic as to whether or not it’s desirable fr om the standpoint of Committee functioning to\nidentify who’s who in these pictures. And thus fa r, while occasionally an individual will indicate\n\nPage in a speech what their personal views are, we ha ve not yet decided that it would be a desirable\nthing for the point of view of our decisionmaki ng process to identify individuals. We have a\nsubcommittee on communications that’s now chaire d by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be\nconsidering the SEP and whether or not some cha nges are appropriate. Bu t until and unless there\nis some change in the Committee stance on this, I don’t want to identify myself.\nYou asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable\ndivergence between market views a nd the views of the Committee. I’d say that there have been\nany number of different analyses of this topic, there are many different survey measures and\ninterpretations of what the market thinks. And I don’t frankly think it’s completely clear that\nthere is a gap. There are different views on whether or not such a gap exists . To the extent that\nthere is a gap, one reason for it could be that ma rkets and participants ha ve different views on the\nevolution of economic conditions. For example, I think I’d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the fede ral funds rate, they are showing the funds rate\npath that they consider most likely. Their ec onomic forecasts are of the conditions that they\nthink are the most likely ones. You don’t see the full range of possibilities there. And the path\nfor the funds rate is the path that each individu al thinks is most likely. Market participants,\nunderstanding that there are a range of po ssible outcomes, with upside and downside\npossibilities, are doing something slightly differe nt, I think, when they’r e determining market\nprices. They are taking into account the po ssibility that there can be different economic\noutcomes, including—even if they’re not ve ry likely—ones in which outcomes will be\ncharacterized by low inflation or low growth a nd the appropriate path of rates will be low.\nSo, differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of that. We, you\nknow, want to learn, we—market participants may have different views on the economy than the\n\nPage Committee does, and that’s something we want to try to infer and learn ma rket views, in part\nfrom information of this type. What I can say is that it is important for market participants to\nunderstand what our likely response or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to\ncommunicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data,\nand I promise to try to do that.\nYLAN MUI. Hi, Ylan Mui, Washington Post . My question is about the new exit\nprinciples. You guys say that you don’t plan to e nd reinvestments until after the first rate hike.\nCan you give us a little bit of a sense of what are the condition s you’re going to be looking for\nwhen you eventually begin to end the reinvestments? It sounds like tapering the reinvestments is\nalso on the table. What might go into your deci sion on whether or not to end them altogether,\nwhether or not to taper them? And do you have a general timeline for how long you think it will\ntake to shrink the balance sheet once you actually start?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Okay. All good questions. So, I think the Committee would—will\nbe focused on—we intend to use the path of short- term interest rates as our key tool of policy.\nAnd, of course, market participan ts will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate\ntiming and pace of interest rate increases when that time comes. And I think the Committee\nwould like to feel that it ha s successfully begun the normalization process and that we’re\nsuccessfully communicating with ma rkets about how that process wi ll be playing out over time.\nAnd I think when the Committee is comfortable that that process is established, is working well,\nand we’re comfortable with the outlook, that they will begin the process of ceasing—or possibly\ntapering—but eventually ceasing reinvestments.\nSo, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make\nsure normalization is successfu lly under way. If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by\n\nPage ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take—to get back to levels of reserve balances that we\nhad before the crisis—I’m not sure we will go that low, but we’ve said that we will try to shrink\nour balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation\nof policy—it could take to the end of the decade to achieve those levels.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. You said a few mo ments ago that there is perhaps some\nremaining shortfall of labor for ce participation as a result of cy clical factors. This seems\nconsistent with a recent paper by some memb ers of your staff finding that labor force\nparticipation is unlikely to recove r. Is that now the “house” view that slack essentially consists\nof unemployment plus part-time workers who want full-time work, and that labor force participation is basically out of the equation?\nAnd the second question—in the statement of ex it principles, you said that the Committee\nwill act as soon as economic conditions warrant. Th ere had been an idea in circulation at some\npoint that you might stay lower for longer as a means of compensating for some of the damage\ndone during the recession. Is this an indication that that debate has been settled, and that that\nidea is off the table?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’m sorry. Ju st remind me, what was the first question? The first\nquestion—\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The first question was— CHAIR YELLEN. Please. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The first question wa s, has the labor force participation—\nCHAIR YELLEN. Ah, labor force participation—\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. —been removed from the slack equation?\n\nPage CHAIR YELLEN. So the recent Brookings paper by the Fed economists clearly\nindicates, and I said this at Jackson Hole, th at there are structural reasons, particularly\ndemographics but not only demographics, why la bor force participation should be expected to\ndecline over time. And I agree with that, and I be lieve that most of my colleagues would endorse\nthat as well. However, they did indicate that, in the paper, that they see some remaining cyclical\nshortfall. By one technique that they used, th ey placed the estimate at ¼ percent, but by another\ntechnique that they used it could be, I believe they said, as large as 1 percent. And so my own\npersonal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly—probably within that range. But nevertheless, it’s a meaningful cyclical shortfa ll. It’s not completely—so I’m\ngiving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment—that, you know, I see the flat—and\ngiven the underlying downward trend in labor force particip ation, we might interpret the\nflattening out of labor force par ticipation over the last year as showing that that cyclical\ncomponent has diminished somewhat. I think ther e is something that remains, but eventually I\nwould certainly agree with the authors, we should expect over time to see labor force\nparticipation declining. And then, let’s see, the s econd piece was—\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Is the debate about lower-for-longer essentially over?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, you know, we stayed low for a very long time. We have been\nat zero for a very long time and below the leve ls that some common policy rules would now be\nsuggesting, given the level of unemployment and infl ation. So the recovery has been very slow.\nWe’ve also been doing unconventional policies, of course, buying assets. And in a general\nsense, I think we have been lower for longe r than—if you complete that sentence—than many\nstandard policy rules would suggest. So, in a sens e, that is a policy that we have had. And once\nwe decide it’s appropriate to be gin to normalize policy and to rais e the level of our target for\n\nPage short-term interest rates, it would still take some time for rates to get back to levels—you can see\nin our projection that by the end of 2017, the partic ipants are, on average, projecting that rates\nwill reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run. And, similarly, we could make a\nsimilar statement with respect to where th e funds rate would stand relative to the\nrecommendations of rules. So that would take some time to return to those kinds of levels.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Thank you. Marty Crut singer with the Associated Press.\nMadam Chair, there were two dissents from toda y’s decision. I’d kind of like to get your\nthinking on how you treat dissents. I think in Chairman Bernanke ’s eight years, the largest\nnumber of dissents was three. Do you see two dissents as a yellow-warning flashing light that\npolicy may need to be moderated down the road ? How should market participants read the\ndissents?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think it’s very natu ral that the Committee should have a range\nof opinion about a decision as crucial as what is the right time to begin to normalize policy, and\nwe do have a range of views in the Committee. I don’t consider two dissents to be an\nabnormally large number. Presidents Plosser and Fisher have been quite clear in all of their\nspeeches recently in stating that they think the time has come to begin normalizing policy. I\nthink they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial\nstability concerns. But the Co mmittee adopted today’s statemen t by an overwhelming majority,\nand I don’t consider the level of dissent to be surprising or very abnormal.\nGREG IP. Greg Ip of The Economist . There’s been another downgrade in your near-\nterm growth forecast and a downgrade in your unemployment rate path forecast. Does it appear\n\nPage that potential is much lower than you thought, a nd therefore slack is closing more quickly than\nyou thought? This seems to be a pers istent pattern to your forecasts.\nSecondarily, how concerned are you about even ts in Europe and especially the recent\ndecline in inflation expectations there?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So there’s been a little bit of dow ngrading, I think, ev en this time in\nthe longer-run normal growth rates that Committ ee participants have written down. You are\ncertainly right in saying that over a number of y ears now, there’s been a pa ttern of forecast errors\nin which either we’ve been on track with resp ect to unemployment or unemployment has come\ndown in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been\nsurprising the Committee to the downside. And th at is a statement about productivity growth,\nwhich has been pretty disappointing. So we have had downward revisions in the level of\npotential output and to some exte nt, at least for a time, in the pr ojected pace of growth. So that\ntension has been there.\nThere are a range of views about long-run grow th. A lot of people are writing about this\ntopic. I think the Committee’s longer-run estimates are neither at the most pessimistic end nor\nthe most optimistic end.\nGREG IP. I had a question about Europe. CHAIR YELLEN. Oh, about Eu rope. Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have\ndiscussed the outlook for Europe—the very low leve l of inflation that they have seen recently\nand the decline that they saw in inflationary expectat ions, in the slow pace of growth. It is one of\na number of risks to the global economy, and we cer tainly hope that they will be successful in\nseeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global\neconomy and the United States.\n\nPage ROBIN HARDING. Robi n Harding from the Financial Times . Madam Chair, I want to\ncome back to the forward guidance. Quite a larg e part of the Committee has recently criticized\nthe guidance as being calendar based. But if I understood your comments earlier, that’s not\ncorrect. How should people understand it? And if it doesn’t have a defined meaning, what\npurpose is it actually serving? And do you expect to have to revisit it in the near future? Thank\nyou.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we are c onstantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about\nwhether it’s appropriate and how to revise it. And we did do a major overhaul of our forward\nguidance in March. I think the Committee part icipants who have spoken out on this topic\nrecently want to make sure that we have the fl exibility—that the Committee has the flexibility to\nrespond to unfolding developments. They want to ma ke sure that if progre ss really does turn out\nto be faster than we have—we would expect, th at the Committee will be in a position to start\nsooner tightening monetary policy. They do not wa nt to be locked into something that the\nmarkets see as a calendar-based and firm commitment. And so they want to emphasize data\ndependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibil ity. But I agree with\nthat. And, as I said earlier, I think we do not ha ve any mechanical interpretation that applies to\nthis. It, of course, gives an impression about wh at we think will be appropriate, but there is no\nmechanical interpretation. And I’ve said repeat edly, and I want to say again, that if events\nsurprise us, and we’re moving more quickly to ward our objectives, and the Committee sees a\nneed to move sooner or later depending on what th e data is, that we do f eel—I do feel we have\nthe flexibility to move. And it is important fo r markets to understand that there is uncertainty,\nand this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time.\n\nPage STEVEN BECKNER. Good afte rnoon, Chair Yellen. Getting b ack to the one aspect of\nthe forward guidance is the statement, which you’ ve reiterated about the funds rate probably\nneeding to stay below normal for some time after achieving mandate-consistent levels on\nunemployment, inflation, and so forth. The SEP assessments of appropriate funds rate levels\nshow the funds rate getting up to that 3.75 percen t normal level at the en d of 2017. If you look at\nthe SEP projections of unemployment, inflation, a nd so forth, they seem to get back to those\nmandate-consistent levels by the end of 2016, if not mu ch sooner. So what is the justification for\nwaiting that much longer to get back to normal, particularly when you have such a large balance\nsheet that you intend to reduce onl y gradually? Is there a danger of getting behind the curve?\nAnd, secondly, can I just ask, can you envision a time when, to reduce reserve pressures,\nyou may have to resort to asset sa les that you don’t anticipate doing now?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal\nlevels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are\nanticipating that rates will return to what they think ar e normal longer-ru n levels, but the\neconomy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and\nnear-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016. So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels.\nWe asked participants why they hold the view s that they do about appropriate policy, and\nthere are a number of different e xplanations that participants give . But a common view on this is\nthat there have been a variety of headwinds resulti ng from the crisis that have slowed growth, led\nto a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that\nthey are dissipating—an example wo uld be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point,\navailable really to those with pristine credit . Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.\n\nPage Another thing that we se e is that households’ exp ectations about their likely income paths remain\nquite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels . That’s something that may be holding back\nconsumer spending. So the view would be that those forces will dissipate over time, but only\nvery gradually. In addition, we have had slow productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential\noutput likely depresses the pace of investment sp ending. And so, those are some of the things\nthat participants mention as why it will take some time to get back.\nSo the story is, it’s not that the Fed is behind the curve in fa iling to return the funds rate\nto normal levels when the economy is recovered. It is rather th at, in order to achieve such a\nrecovery in 2016 or by the end, that it’s necessary and appropriate to have a somewhat more\naccommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes of Fox Busi ness, ma’am. I would like to follow up on\nGreg’s question about Europe, because to morrow Scotland is going to be voting on\nindependence from Great Britain, and there’s some concern that if it do es vote to break from\nGreat Britain, that this could cause some turmoil in global fi nancial markets and the global\neconomy. Are you concerned about that? Do you see any impact if Scotland does vote for independence on the European economy and poten tially on the American economy? And, if so,\nis the Fed doing anything in prepar ation for that possibility? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, Scottish voters are about to go to the polls tomorrow, and\nthey’ve had a good debate about this topic. And in light of that, I really don’t want to weigh in\non this today.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Thank you. Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires. My\nquestion is about your particular views about whether a gradual appr oach to tightening is better\nthan a more aggressive and less predictable one, because there was some discussion about—\n\nPage internally and externally, about whether it was the Fed’s predicta bility in the 2004-ish period that\nkind of created the conditions of complacency th at led to the housing bubble. So I wonder if\nyou’d be more inclined to be gradualist in your approach and more transp arent in outlining future\nmoves or whether you think keeping the market guessing—there’s some value to that. Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. You know, this is somethi ng the Committee is going to have to\ndiscuss when the time comes to normalize polic y. Looking back on the period, the run-up to the\nfinancial crisis, I don’t think, by any means, “m easured pace” and the very predictable pace of\n25 basis points per meeting explains why we had a financial crisis, but it may have diminished\nvolatility and been a small contributing factor, and the Committee will have to think about how\nto do this. I think many people in the aftermath of that episode think that somewhat less of a\nmechanical pace would perhaps be better, but this is a matter that we will, in due time, have to\ndiscuss."
