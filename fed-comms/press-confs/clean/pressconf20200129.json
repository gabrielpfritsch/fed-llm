  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone. Thanks for being here. At today’s\nmeeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged. As always, we base\nour decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us :\nmaximum employment and price stability. We believe monetary policy is well positioned to\nserve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a\nreturn of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal.\nThe expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Growth in household spending\nmoderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat\nconsumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid. In contrast,\nbusiness investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the\npast year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in\nthese sectors. However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and\nthere are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid -2018.\nNonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those pose d by the new\ncoronavirus. Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate\neconomic growth to continue.\nThe unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more than a year, and\nthe pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime\nworking years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade. And wages have been\nrising, particularly for lower- paying jobs. People who live and work in middle -income\ncommunities and low -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are\nnow finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and\n\nethnic groups and all levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance\nof sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.\nInflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months\nthrough November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and c ore inflation, which excludes\nvolatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent. Available data suggest similar inflation\nreadings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few\nmonths as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation. While low and\nstable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can\nlead longer -term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn ,\ninterest rates would be lower as well —closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, we\nwould have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the\ndetriment of American families and businesses. We have seen th is dynamic play out in other\neconomies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States.\nIn particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support\nsustained economic growth, a strong labor market , and inflation returning to our 2 percent —\nsymmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains\nbroadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain\nappropriate. We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with\nother information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for\nthe federal funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of\nour outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course.\nI will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to\nimplement monetary policy. The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase\n\nTreasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in\nproviding an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the\nfederal funds rate. In light of the resulting stability in the fed eral funds rate and money market\nconditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to\nadministered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range. This\naction reverses the small downward adj ustment made in September when money markets were\nvolatile.\nAs our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample\nconditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede. Over the first half of\nthis year, w e intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from\ntheir active use in supplying reserves. This process will take place gradually , and, as indicated in\ntoday’s FOMC directive to the Desk , we expect to continue offering r epos at least through April\nto ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves. Based on current projections, we expect that\nthe underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter\nof this year. As we get close to t hat point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition\nto a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves\nwithout the active use of repos. At that point, as in the pre -crisis period, our balance sheet will\nbe expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and\nother Federal Reserve liabilities.\nAll of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective\nimplementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chance—a change in the\nstance of monetary policy. We are committed to completing the transition to our longer -run\nample -reserves regime smoothly and predictably. Of course, we will continue to closely monitor\n\nconditions in money markets , and we will adjust these plans as conditions warrant. Thank you,\nand I ’ll be happy to take your questions.\nCHRIS TOPHER CONDON. Thank you. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr.\nChairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I’ve\nnoted in the statement. It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring—the Committee\nbelie ves—inflation back to the Committee ’s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective. That’s a\nslight change from the last time , when you w ere expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back\nnear the objective. And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last\npress conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had\nprojected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate mone tary policy. Should\nwe take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2 percent\noutcome for inflation is already baked in the cake , or that this is a signal that the Committee has\na stronger resolution to bring inflat ion at least to the 2 percent objective and put —bring into play\nan informal makeup strategy for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So, in making that change, our goal was , really —that was,\nchanging “ near” to “returning to ”—was to avoid possible misinterpretat ion. So you may\nremember , in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the\nlanguage that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be\nmisinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfor table with inflation running below\nthat level.\nSo we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be\nappropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with\ninflation rising persistently —running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective. So,\n\nyes, there is something in that. It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to\n2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around—symmetrically around 2 percent , and\nthat we ’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now\nwhere we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low\nunemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Than k you. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I want to ask\nabout the balance sheet. How many reserves are “ample ”? How many reserves does the Fed\nnow think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework? And can you walk me through\nhow you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, thanks for that question. Why don’t I say a few things\nabout repos , since I know that’ll be of interest. So , just to bring you back, after last September’s\nbrief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action , and a result —as a result, money markets have\nbeen operating smoothly since then. Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill\npurchases of at least —of $60 billion —sorry—at least in to the second quarter, and term and\novernight repo at least through April. And I will get to your specific question.\nThe purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly\nto the federal funds rate, which requires well -functioning money markets. It doesn’t mean we’re\ntrying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets. We know that some volatility is normal and\nexpected in well -functioning markets. And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been\nsuccessful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves. Money markets operated smoothly,\nincluding right through year -end, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range. So we\nknow —we will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at\n\na level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest\non reserves and reverse repo , without the need for frequent use of open market operations.\nBased on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the\nunderlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year. And\nwhen we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to\nthe level of the unde rlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities. As our bill purchases bring\nthe underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity\nof overnight and term repo will gradually decline. We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in\nthe quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions\npermit. At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate. Even after we reach an ample\nlevel of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support\neffective control of the federal funds rate. And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it\nunder our implementation framework.\nComing to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that\nreserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range\ndepending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account , or\nTGA. In particular, reserve levels will ne ed to be at a level high enough to remain ample even\nwhen the TGA peaks during the April tax season. Effectively, what that means is that we need\nreserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September —and, I would say, around\n$1½ trillion , subject to learning more. Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I\nmentioned, and we want to be clear , that will be the bottom end of the range. We want\n$1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range. So, most of the time , reser ves will\nbe moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1½ trillion .\n\nSo it’s not an —it’s not something that we’re aiming at all the time. We know that\nreserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time. We also want\ninterest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC’s target range.\nAnd we think that’ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment.\nLast points —we’re committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one. We’ll\nprovide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go , as we always have. And we’re\nprepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary\npolicy implementation.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.\nFollowing up on Nick’s question, I know you said it’s not QE , but it’s $390 billion over\nfive months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet. I guess I’d ask one more time on Nick’s\nquestion— is there a number that you have in mind?\nSecondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE , and\nthey’re trading that way. Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE\nprogram , and that the rise in the stoc k market is linked to it , and you may then experience\nsomething of a “ taper tantrum ” the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’ll just—I’ll repeat that —we think that the —we think we need to\ncontinue purchases until the —until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below\n$1½ trillion , roughly, during the course of the calendar year. And we know that the TGA will\nmove up and down there . So they’ll be much higher than that some of the time , but that’s kind\nof the number , and we think we’ll reach that sometime in the second quarter. That’s our\nestimate. But we will— we’ll know it when we get there. We’ll know it because we’ll be able to\n\nbe—to control the federal funds rate without use of —without active use, ongoing use of open\nmarket operations.\nYou know, our intention of these —for these adjustments is just to raise the level of\nreserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner. And\nthat’s —that is our sole intention. I pointed out on other occasions , more than once , the\ndifferences —the really specific differences between this and the large- scale asset purchase\nprograms. We’ve been over that.\nIn terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets. It’s very\nhard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets. What I can tell you is that\nyou know what our intention is. It is to return reserves to an ample level. We expect that to\nhappen during the second quarter. And our plan as we do that is , as those purchases get to that\nlevel, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce\nrepo as—as we reach an ample level, as we’re satisfying demand now more from underlying\nreserves from bill purchases rather than from repo.\nAnd, again, the last thing I’ll say is , we’re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as\nwe’ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell . Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. I\nwas hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market. We’ve recently seen wages\nmoderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others. As you\nmentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it see ms like we are seeing those wages\nclimb up a little bit, but it doesn’t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average. I was\nwondering if you’d talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks , or whether\nyou’re worried about tha t, or how you’re thinking about it.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. The l abor market continues to—to perform well. The labor market\ncontinues to be strong. We see strong job creation. We see low unemployment. Very\nimportantly, we see labor force participation continuin g to move up, really , against expectations.\nIf you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecast s suggesting that we could have\nbeen at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population\nthat we’re seeing n ow, let alone the unemployment level. So I think we’ve learned quite a lot of\ngood things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there’s been more room to run.\nThe performance of wages, I think , has to be seen in that context. We saw —if you go\nback four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at\naround 2 percent, and now they’re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about\nwhere th ey might be at full employment. It would consist of inflat ion plus —plus productivity\ngrowth. The —it’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment ,\nwe haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and\nother periods of low unemployment.\nSo you a sked, what can be explaining that ? You know, one thing can be that the natural\nrate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would\nappear just from the 3½ percent number. And the other can be , I think , that —as I mentioned, the\nsort of supply- side shock or surprise that we’re receiving from higher labor force participation.\nPeople are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply , and that is —that ’s a\ngreat thing. That’s a very healthy thing. We’re a country that has low labor force participation\ncompared to essentially all of our advanced -economy peers , and it’s a very good, positive thing.\nNonetheless , it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. In terms\nof the framework review and a little bit on Chris’s question earlier, there is a general feeling now\nin the markets and among analysts that you’re basically setting us up for some form of inflat ion-\ntarget averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to\nmake up for the time that it has spent below that. Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where\nyou think you’re going to end up? What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea\npersonally ? And, as long as I’m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect\nthe results of the review?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt ,\nand I felt , that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “ new normal ” into\nour policy framework. And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful\nglobal disinflationary trends, which have led to lower -than-target infla tion many places in the\nworld; s econdly, a flat Phillips curve , by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to\nresource utilization —for example , low unemployment; a nd, thirdly, a much lower neutral real\ninterest rate here and around the world. So those ar e challenging conditions for monetary policy\nto deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would\nsay that , under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it\nfor most of the tim e lately to achieve those goals , although we do struggle , as other central banks\ndo, with the inflation goal.\nSo this is about reviewing our strategy , tools , and communications to assure that they’re\nthe best that we can do to achieve those goals in this envi ronment on a sustained basis. And we\ncontinued our discussions at this meeting. I’m very, very pleased at the process so far. It’s\nincluded the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range\n\nof people and groups across American society. That was a very, very positive experience, and I\nthink we learned a lot. We ’ve now had a series of —a number of FOMC meetings at which\nwe’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy , tools , and\ncommunications. I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions\naround the middle of the year. Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all\nthat together.\nSo I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal pr eferences right\nnow. I’m trying to—a nd we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers. I\nfeel very positive about —that we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just\ngoing to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Going back to your outlook for global\ngrowth, we’ve seen some significant headwinds , as you mentioned earlie r, with the easing —with\nthe partial U.S. –China trade deal , but now that there’s some new concern fo llowing the outbreak\nof the coronavirus —that it might shake global growth. We’re already seeing reports from Ford\nand Toyota that they’re planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week. Apple is\nrerouting their supply chains. Starbucks is shutting down close to thousands of stores. Are you\nworried at all about what the impact would be on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a\nsignificant risk —excuse me—to the outlook at this point ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me talk about the coronavirus s pecifically, and then I’ll turn\nmore to global growth more generally. First, it’s a —it’s a very serious issue , and I want to start\nby acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already\ncausing. There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on\n\nthe spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already\nbeen imposed.\nOf course, the situation is really in its early stages , and it’s very unce rtain about how far\nit will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading\npartners and neighbors and around the world. So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to\nspeculate about it at this point. I w ill just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully\nmonitoring the situation.\nAnd, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is , what are the potent ial\nramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate ? More broadly,\nthough, if I can talk about the global economy for a second— and if you look at the backdrop,\nyou know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the\nmiddle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last\nyear. The fourth- quarter growth globally was quite weak last year , and a number of factors\nplayed into that. It wasn’t any one factor. There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but\nalso there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial\nexcesses. There was a turn —downturn in the global high -tech manufacturing cycle in global\nauto production. There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina ,\nTurkey. A nd then, later, in Hong Kong and Chile , you had social unrest. So, all of those things\nwere playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the cours e of 2019 and the last half\nof ’18.\nI would say, now there are grounds for what I would call “ cautious optimism ” about the\noutlook now for the global economy. Many analysts are predicting a pick up in growth this year,\nalthough still to relatively modest growth rates . And I would—people are pointing to , and we\n\nwould point to, support ive financial co nditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a\nhard Brexit. The high- tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia,\nincluding in China. The latest indicators —manufacturing PMIs , for example —suggest that\nmanufacturing may have bottomed out , that they’re still below 50 in many jurisdictions , but they\nhave moved up off of their lows.\nI would—I would just say, none of this is assured. As I mentioned, we saw the fourth\nquarter of last year came in quite weak —weak er than ex pected. We are not at all assured of a\nglobal rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it. And then comes the coronavirus ,\nwhich, again, it’s too early to say what the effects will be. Of course, we’re, as I mentioned,\nmonitoring it carefully. There will clearly be implications , at least in the near term , for Chinese\noutput and, I would guess , for some of their close -in neighbors , and we’ll just have to see what\nthe effect is globally.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times. As recently as\n2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate\nup. Over the course of the adjustments since last year , it’s moved steadily down, closer to the\nbottom of the band. So, if you’re moving it back up, how high do you want to get it? Are we\nlooking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves\nto the middle of the band? And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we’re\napproachi ng “ample ”?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well\nwithin the range. That’s it. W ell within the range. And that , clearly, you know —5 basis points\nfrom the bottom or from the top isn’t that. So that’s why we moved back up. You’re right. Last\nyear we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system. We saw\n\nthe—gradually moving up. And, in hindsight , we know what was happening. With ample\nreserves, we see—we see that it’s possible to bri ng the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis\npoints. So now we’re —now we are well within the range, I would say.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. We are. So you don’t think that , as the fed funds goes back up\ntowards the center of the range , that IOER is going to end up at the top?\nCHAIR POWELL. Don’t know that. We want it to be well within the range. I think\nwe’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate. Ultimately , what we’re trying to do is\ndeliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range . IOER is just a tool to do that. If we —if\nwe need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that . It just means —I mean ,\nthe thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate —which is the rate\nthat, of course , transmits into other money market rates , which ultimately transmit into all kinds\nof financial conditions —that’s what we care about. So, ultimately, we will —we will use that\ntool to keep it well within the range.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schnei der with Reuters. Just to sort of\nclose the loop on one thing, w here do discussions stand on a standing repo facility? Because\nwhat you’ve said so far sort of implies that there won’t be one or that it will be a limited one. So\nif you could just, you know, let us know where that discussion stands. And also—\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER. Can you turn mic over? Turn the mic over.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Sorry about that. Sorry about that . Did you get the question?\nDid you hear the question okay?\nCHAIR POWELL. I did. I don’t think —I’m not sure your colleagues did. [Laughter]\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Where do the discussions stand on standing repo? [Aside]\nThat was great.\n\nAnd the other thing is , on the, you know , on the standing repo facility and on the\npurchases— Treasury bill purchases, as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or\nlater in the year, w ill that be preannounced by amounts? Will the re be preset amounts like\nyou’re doing now , or will that just be something that people will have to sort of intuit and figure\nout as you go along?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’ll go in reverse order. When we —when we make decisions\nabout the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some\nlength, we’ll be making them as earl y as we can and as transparently as we can —and\nspecifically. But we’re not at that stage. It’s January , and we’re several months away from —\nfrom that.\nIn terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess , in my answer to an\nearlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample-\nreserves level. Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decided —we haven’t at\nall made a decision on a standing repo facility . We haven’t. We ’ve had a couple of discussions\nabout it , as you know , back in, I guess , June and October. And there’s a range of views . We’re\ngoing to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question.\nAnd I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that —\nwhat that world looks like. And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of , how useful will\nit be? What will be the costs and benefits? And my thinking is , we will return to that fairly\nsoon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other . Really , we haven’t made one ,\nbecause we haven’t had to . And I think you—when you delay, you get more information by\nwaiting. It’s good to wait. We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re\nstill trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample -reserves regime.\n\nHEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. I’m wondering, do you\nthink that there is a financial stability risk from climate change? Yo u’ve spoken several times\nthat you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring\nwhat that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that ’s sort of one institution.\nDo you think there’s a systemwide risk that may —that could develop from climate change?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s an interesting question—the question being, is there a\nsystemwide financial stability risk? I’d say , over —over the longer term , it’s certainly possible ,\nand I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an\ninstitution. So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue ,\nbut it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federa l government and state\ngovernments for leadership on that. And, importantly , society’s overall response to climate\nchange needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed.\nAll of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary polic y mandate and,\nmore immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets,\nutilities , and financial institutions , banks . And we haven’t —we share overall responsibility for\nfinancial stability with a number of agencies. And that latter part—I think the public has every\nright to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust\nagainst the risks from climate change.\nNow, I think that’s got to be right . We are in the very early stages, as are other central\nbanks , in understanding just what that means. And there’s quite a lot of work going on around\nthe world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through. But I do think it’s —in\nthat sense, it has to be part of our role , and—but not the overall response of society to climate\nchange. That’s not us.\n\nHEATHER LONG. And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn’t signed\non to the Network for Greening the Financial System like 40 other central banks have?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them , and\nwe’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that . We\nprobably will do that at some point. So that’s —that’s an ongoing question. B ut we’re very\nmuch attending those meetings and taking part in them .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness Network. So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today. M id-\nFebruary, the phase- one China dea l gets —goes into effect. Have you seen business investment\npick up at all? If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty\nis—is being cleared up?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a\nphase -one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[ C]A\nagreed —those are potentially positive things for the economy without question. W ithout\nquestion. And financial markets —the reaction of financial marke ts is very consistent with that\nperception. A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment ,\ninvestment, which would provide some additional support for the economy.\nIt’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things. First, trade policy uncertainty\nremains elevated. Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk. We still have two or\neven three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now. So it hasn’t\ngone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments —\nsorry, contacts in the business world. And I think, clearly , these are seen as positive\ndevelopments going forward, but there’s a bit of a wait -and-see attitude —is this going to be\n\nsustain ed? The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that’ll take quite some time. So, I\nwould say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy.\nThere’s also the global economy. You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I\nmentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced\neconomies and emerging market economies. We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible\nthat this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur\nfurther growth.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Hi, Mike Derby with Dow Jones . Do you have any greater sense\nof what —what was going wrong with the repo market starting in September? There seem ed to\nbe, you know —whether it was a one -off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and\ndebt settlement , or whether there’s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more\nstructural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector .\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. As for those forces, so , as we indicated , we would undertake a,\nyou know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory\npractices. A nd we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow\nmore easily in the system as long as it didn ’t undermine safety and soundness. And so we’ve\nundertaken that , and w e’ve done a ton of work, a ctually . We don’t have anything to announce\nhere today , but I feel good about the —what we’ve learned there. I think —you mentioned other\nfactors. W e will be announcing our findings. I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re —\nwe’re well along in that assessment at this time.\nI think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to\nconduct our operations without frequent reso rt to open market operations was higher than we had\nthought and was higher than others had thought, too. We learned that we can’t let reserves —we\n\nshouldn’t let reserves go below $1½ trillion —roughly, the level of early September —at any\npoint. And that me ans that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that\nwill be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion] , but they won’t ever go below. So $1½ [trillion]\nis not a target level . It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Mr. Chairman . I just wanted to ask about how your\nbalance sheet operations and repo—temporary repos —how they affect the system and who\nthey’re helping. Clearly, they’re mostly designed, as you said, to get —keep the fed funds rate in\nthe range you’re looking for. But , certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds\nand other Wall Street institutions . And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street why\nyou’re doing all this for that market? And how would you address criticism that it is helping\nmostly Wall Street, along with everything else? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important\nreason for ca ring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are—our\nmonetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets —through the money\nmarkets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions. So we care that\nmoney markets are operating smoothly. A nd they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in\nSeptember. And so we acted. This is a one -time thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of\nreserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smo othly on an ongoing basis.\nRepo markets are important , because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of\nTreasury securities, which is the way —you know, the federal —part of the way the federal\ngovernment is funding its operations. It’s the way thos e are financed. So these are largely\nTreasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to —for distribution to —and buyers , to a\nsubstantial extent . That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market. So it’s just the financing\n\nfor—for that. Now, a gain, we don’t —that activity is a —is a market activity. We’re not looking\nto eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all. What we care about is that\nvolatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of —of our policy decisions t o federal\nfunds rate , and that really is important for the public.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks\ninvesting in venture ca pital funds? What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering? And\nwhy make those changes?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a —a new part\nof—part of the existing Volcker rule , and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule . And\nwe’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and\nthe spirit of the law. We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, a nd we’re\ngoing to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals. Again, we\nbelieve that they will be —and you’ll see them tomorrow —will be public —you know, will be\npublicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Now, is this just the venture capital f unds, or are also\nyou changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity funds ?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s covered funds. It’s —so it’s th at covered —so it’s not the\nproprietary trading part of Volcker . It’s the covered funds part.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. And is there a chance that banks could take this and\nrun and maybe even get involved in mortgage -backed securities again and risky investments?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we’ll —we think that what we’re doing is —is very\nconsistent with safety and soundness and ab solutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the\n\nVolcker rule. We’ll be —we’ll be getting comments from people, and we’ll be looking into that\nquestion, among many others.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Powell. I’d like to turn your atte ntion\nback to China and the health of its financial sector in particular. And I guess I’m basing my\nquestion on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month. Just —in March\nof that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, a nd one of your colleagues on the\nFOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt —hit the U.S.\neconomy. And the staffer said that there was a —what they were worried about was that not only\nwas the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector . And the quote was :\n“There’s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.” Now, I was wondering if you could\ngive us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector . And how do you think it\nmight impact the economy, particularly now that they’ve been hit by this unexpected shock?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that\nperiod—2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, a nd I thought —which was essentially just a lot of debt\nfor an emerging market . For an economy at the —at th e stage of evolution of the Chinese\neconomy, they had very high levels of debt —not sovereign debt the way we think of it , but more\nbusiness debt —debt of state- owned enterprises and also just private businesses.\nAnd a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control —to stop\nthe growth and to control it. And that —as I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese\ngrowth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that. And\nthey’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you\nknow, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing. The authorities have stuck to that\n\nand have, again, continued to t ry to do that , so—to try to control the growth of debt . And that’s\nimportant that they do that.\nWe don’t think that —that there’s any imminent risk there , although you—as you point\nout, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will —will have some effects on the\nChinese economy, at least in the short term. The Chinese economy is very important in the\nglobal economy now. And, you know, we —when China’s economy slows down, we do feel\nthat—not as much as countries, though, that are near Chi na or th at trade more actively with\nChina, like some of the Western European countries. We still have —you know, 85 percent of\nour economy is domestic. And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other\neconomies just because of our phys ical location.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi . Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Fi nance. So the combination of\nT-bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as “ liquidity .” I’m just\nwondering if you semantically agree with that description —then, seco ndly, what the impact of\nthat has been on risk assets. I don’t know if that’s something that , you know , the Board or\nReserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been. H ow\nare you kind of thinking about that going forward? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so , two questions. I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what\nwe’re doing is what I said : We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that\nbanks can meet their reserve requirements, and that t here’s enough reserves in the system that we\ndon’t see reserve scarcity , and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional\nreserves. So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace\nsometime in the second quarter.\n\nIn terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it’s very hard to say what is affecting\nfinancial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time. It’s not our intention to\nchange the stance of monetary policy. These were designed to provide more reserves and, really ,\nto do that in order to enable better transmission of our —of our rate decisions into the economy\nunder our chosen framework. That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi . Jean Yung with MNI. I wanted to ask about the framework review\nagain. Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period—would that call for a different\npolicy stance if you made that shift? And whether or not we know the answer to that question,\nwould the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was\nno change to the economic outlook?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance.\nWe think it’s appropriate . We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are\nbroadly in keeping with our outlook. Over time —over time , though—let me take a step back.\nOver time, an average inflation -targeting framework would be different than our current\nframework , in the sense that it wouldn’t be a—there would be some aspect of trying to make\ninflation average 2 percent over time, which means , if it runs below 2 percent for a time , it has to\nrun above to bring the average up. So that is a different framework.\nOur current framework is one where we say —or we’d be equally concern ed with\ndeviations of inflation from target on either side. But that isn’t—that doesn’t suggest an\nintention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric. In other words, that would—\nconsistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ ve had,\nactually. So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different\n\napproach to policy. Again, I’m not trying to—I don’t want to comment on the current stance of\npolicy, whi ch we do think is appropriate.\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. I wanted to ask you about the stock market.\nBy historical comparisons , as you know, valuations are considerably high. And I just wonder\nhow much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risk s you\nsee for the economy.\nCHAIR POWELL. S o we —we look at a very broad range of financial conditions\nwhere —there isn’t any one financial condition that we —that we look at. And when we look at\nfinancial conditions, wh at matters for the real economy is substantial changes in —or, material\nchanges in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time.\nIf I can, maybe I’ll —maybe I’ll answer that in the context of our overall financial\nstability framework. That’ s one way to look at it. So we look at —when we look at financial\nstability, we look a t—really, we’ve got four pillars to that, t he first of which is leverage in the\nfinancial system that is at a comfortable level. Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high\nlevels of capital.\nThe second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and\nbusinesses. Households’ debt to GDP is —has been coming down since the financial crisis. It’s\nnot moving up. It’s at low —low levels compared to what it was before the crisis. So not every\nhousehold— but, in the aggregate , household debt is in a good place, a very good place. Business\ndebt has been moving up. We’ve been calling that out for more than a year —substantially more\nthan a year, and it’s something we’re focused on. A nd we’ve taken appropriate measures and are\nmonitoring carefully. But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability , but\nmore be an amplifier.\n\nThe other one is asset purchases, gett ing to your —sorry, asset prices, getting to your\nquestion. We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated —I do —somewhat elevated . If\nyou look at risk spreads, they’re narrow . If you look at P /Es, they’re high. I think the way to\nthink about —a good way—one way to think about equity prices , though, is , what’s the premium\nyou’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk- free debt ? And that’s also at fairly low\nlevels, but not extremely low levels. So valuations are high, but not at extremes.\nThe factor is funding risk . Are big financial institutions and other players in the\nfinancial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk? And the answer is , very\nstable funding, for the most part. So if you look at , overall —wh at you see , in my view , is,\nvulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall.\nKATY O’DONNELL. Hi . Katy O’Donnell, Politico. I wanted to know, do you support\nGovernor Brainard’s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform ? And is this\nsomething that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA,\nreally, in a way that is a win –win both for the intended beneficiaries —low - and moderate -\nincome communities —and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about —about\nwhat does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing. The law can both be more effective and\nmore efficient is —it comes down to. A nd we think this is a good way. It’ s also just a good time\nto take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and\ndemographic change as well.\nWe worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies. We\nthink that an interagency f inal rule together would be the best outcome. We’re sorry we haven’t\nbeen able to get there , and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to. We spent a lot of\n\ntime on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform. You saw Governor Brainard’s\nrecent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis. And we haven’t made a ny\ndecisions about what we’re going to do, about whether we’ll propose —I mean, our focus has\nbeen entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really. So we haven’t made any\ndecisions about what we’re going to do going forward.\nIn terms of, you know —Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these\nactivities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high\npriority for us. I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve\ndone and with the Fed’s position on this. As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal\nforward. We haven’t decided what to do, whether —going forward. And we’ re not going to\ncomment on the other proposal. It’s just not appropriate to do. It’s not about us. It’s not about\nour views. It’s about the views of the interested parties.\nHANNAH LANG. Hannah Lang with American Banker. Thank you for being here\ntoday. I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles’s recent speech on bank supervision in which\nhe laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime. I wanted to ask, do\nyou agree with his approach ? And are there any plans to codify some of these suggestions later\nin the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do agree that —the principles that he articulated of firm and fair\nsupervision and effective transparency in communications. I also think it’s a good thing that we\nwould have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven’t really\nhad to date. Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean\nthat its level of scrutiny or supervision will change.\n\nSo—and I also thought that, you know, the —he’s raising some very interesting questions\nabout , if you —in the first part of the speech, where he’s talking about regulation and supervision\nand, you know, how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in\neverything the government does wi th the needs of confidential supervision. It’s a very\nchallenging question. It’s one that could use further thought. And as far as the specific, you\nknow, proposals, there’s —you know, they’re interesting, you know, a nd need further\ndevelopment and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Here we go. Sorry, I had it [the microphone] upside\ndown. That’s not too good.\nMr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate . Thank you. I want ed to ask you a question\nabout the —one of the unintended consequences over the years- long low interest rate\nenvironment , and that is that savers haven’t gotten as much return as would have otherwise been\nthe case. What would you say to those individuals who’ve seen the Fed again cutting rates,\neroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings? And how much would you take their\nplight into consideration? How much can you sympathize with them?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we —we are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use\nour tools t o pursue maximum employment and stable prices. And that’s what —that’s our focus.\nNow, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one. So I think if you look—\nlook at the time since the financial crisis. T hat was —in the week [wake] of fairly modest\ngrowth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market. And part of that just is the effect of\nlower interest rates. So, if —so many, many people benefit from low interest rates. In fact, you\ndon’t hear —when you talk to the low - and modera te-income communities, one thing you don’t\n\nhear is, “You ought to raise rates. ” That’s not what you hear. You hear quite the opposite,\nwhich is, you know, “P lease do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.”\nI absolutely sympathize with people. If you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on\nfixed -income generally, then that’s a challenging thing. On the other hand, if you own a home,\nhome values —the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so —but ,\nyes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be\nchallenging. I mean, we have to do what’s best for the —for the overall society and the economy.\nThat’s —those are our orders from Congress. Thanks very much."
