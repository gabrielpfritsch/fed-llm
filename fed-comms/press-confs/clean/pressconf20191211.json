  "text": "December 11 , 2019\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone. To begin, I ’d like to say a few words\nabout Paul Volcker, who, as you know , passed away earlier this week. Paul Volcker served as\nFederal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987. He accomplished many things during his long and\ndistinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere. Of course, he’ s best known for leading the fight\nto tame the d ouble -digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the\nprosperity and price stability we enjoy today. But what is perhaps most admirable about him —\nmore than his many accomplishments —was his character. He believed that there is no higher\ncalling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’ s share of his life to it. With courage,\nintegrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit\nall Americans. My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example.\nTurning to today’ s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate\nunchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous three meetings. As\nalways, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given\nus: maximum employment and price stability. Our economic outlook remains a favorable one\ndespite global developments and ongoing risks. With our decisions through the course of the\npast year, we believe th at monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by\nsupporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric\n2 percent goal.\nThe economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Household spending\nhas been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer\nconfidence. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing\noutput has declined over the past year. As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth\n\nabroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors. Even so, the overall\neconomy has been growing moderately. And with a strong household sector and supportive\nmonetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue. As seen from\nFOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows\nslightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent.\nThe unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more tha n a year, and\nthe pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime\nworking years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing. And wages have been rising,\nparticularly for lower- paying jobs. People who live and work in low - and middle -income\ncommunities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new\nopportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and\nall levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the\nexpansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. We expect the job\nmarket to remain strong. The median of participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate\nremains below 4 percent ov er the next several years.\nInflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months\nthrough October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent , and core inflation —which excludes\nvolatile food and energy prices and is a better indic ator of future inflation —was 1.6 percent.\nWhile low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our\nobjective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer -term inflation expectations drift\ndown, pulling actua l inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and\ncloser to their effective lower bound. As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support\nthe economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes\n\nfor American families and businesses. Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive\nmonetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent. The median of participants ’\nprojection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent i n 2021. We ’re strongly committed to\nachieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.\nOver the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best\nachieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced\nsome important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments. As the year\nprogressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these\ndevelopments and to provide some insurance against the associat ed risks. In addition, inflation\npressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of\npolicy. Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year , as\nseemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point. This shift has helped\nsupport the economy and has kept the outlook on track. The medians of participants ’ projections\nfor economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago,\naside from a lower inflation projection for 2019. Of course, that is the function of monetary\npolicy— to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces\nacting on the economy.\nWe believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a\nstrong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming\ninformat ion about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance\nof monetary policy likely will remain appropriate. Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the\neffects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we\nassess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if\n\ndevelopments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond\naccordingly. Policy is not on a preset course.\nFinally, I wanted to note that we ’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting\nrepurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1 These technical\noperations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money marke t\npressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Our operations\nhave gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued. To\naddress possible pressures in money markets over the year -end, we ’ve been conducting term\nrepo operations spanning year -end. We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as\nappropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Thank you, and I ’ll be happy to\ntake your questions.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. [Inau dible remark ] Sorry —Howard Schneider with Reuters .\nSorry about that. So I was struck by the , sort of , disconnect that exists here between the behavior\nof unemployment and inflation. Y ou seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three\nyears run ning—more —underneath the longer -run level, yet inflation never really accelerates. S o\nwhat are we to make of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , that ’s—what ’s happening there is the fact that the relationship\nbetween resource utilization , or unemployment , and infl ation has just gotten weaker and weaker\nover the years. If you go back 50 years , you would have seen that, when there was —when labor\nmarkets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up. And then as the Fed\ngot control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where\nthere ’s still a connection, but it’s —it’ s a very faint one. And I —what that suggests is that you\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.\n\nwould need to keep policy somewhat accommodative . And we believe that policy is somewhat\naccommodative , and we think that that ’s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive\nup inflation.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could f ollow up on that —I mean , it’s faint to nonexistent ,\nthough, it seems to me, so this suggest s that, really , your policy leve r as it exists now isn ’t really\ninfluencing prices at all. So , in that case, what do you do to reach your target?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’ t think that’ s right . I mean, we —the —again , the\nrelationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak , has been weak. The coefficient\nis something like 0.1. So it ’s much, much lower than it used to be , but I don’ t know that it ’s\ngone down any more in the last decade . It just is quite faint. But it’ s still there . I mean , you can\nsee it . If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around\n2 percent. And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up\nto 3 and 3½ percent , and that suggests tightening. The same thing is true , but much less true , of\ninflation, the relationship between —in a way , the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient\nthan the price Phillips curve does. But we do still see some relationship , and that ’s what you’ re\nseeing in those numbers.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC. You’ ve used the analogy t o\n1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I ’m wondering if we can sort of continue\nthe analogy. Within seven months of those ’ 98 rate cuts, t he Fed took them back and then som e.\nSo, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place\nnow where we ’re at a neutral rate —“take back ,” I mean if those risks that you say we ’re\ncushioning from don’ t materialize in the way you think—or is this now a new sort of steady state\n\nfor the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and\ndon’t need to take those rate cuts back?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there ’s similarities, conceptual similarities , I think , between th e\ntwo instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’ 98, when the Fed cut three times\nonly to resume raising rates. And the notion just is that it ’s a—the economy needed slightly\nmore accommodative policy , but it wasn ’t the end of the expansion, right? And that ’s the same\nsituation we believe we ’re in here. So this is that we did, in fact , turn out to do three rate cuts .\nThat wasn ’t in the plan, you know , in any kind of specific way at the beginning. So that ’s\nthe same.\nWhat ’s diffe rent is , you have a very different —you have very different structural\ncharacteristics in the economy , particularly around inflation. So now, as you can see , inflation is\nbarely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50- year lows and expected t o remain\nthere. So the need for rate increases is less. And , by the way, this is —it’s a good thing that , you\nknow, we think we can —I think we ’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels\nfor an extended period of time without unwanted upwa rd pressure on inflation. In fact, we need\nsome upward pressure o n inflation to get back to 2 percent. It ’s quite different in ’ 95 and ’ 98\nwhen there were those two adjustments. S o, I would say, similarities and differences.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. The BIS conc luded in— I did the same thing as Howard. Michael\nMcKee, Bloomberg radio and television. The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike\nwas not a one -off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that\ncould lead to a r ecurrence. I ’d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings .\nAnd, given that we ’re approaching year -end for the markets , will you be taking any extra\nsteps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets? There was a report\n\nyesterday from Credit Suisse suggesting there ’s a good chance that we will see disruptions , and\none of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T -bills, and the\nmarket wants to sell coupons . Do you have any plans to sell coupons?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m going to take a little step back, and I will— I will get to your\nspecific questions on the year -end and on T -bills. So I guess I want to start by stressing that\nthese are very important operational matters but that are not like ly to have any macroeconomic\nimplications. We ’d decided back in January to remain an ample -reserves regime, and that means\nwe will be setting the federal funds rate —the range for the federal funds rate through our\nadministered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves. We ’re\ncommitted to robustly implementing that framework , as you can see by our actions. And the\npurpose of all this, let ’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be\ntransmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short -term rates. We have the\ntools to accomplish that , and we will use them. The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all\nvolatility , particularly in the repo market.\nSo, taking you back, this —as you know , we h ad very gradually allowed the balance sheet\nto shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July.\nMeanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of\nthe reserves, and said , “Wha t’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves? ” We got those\nnumbers, we added them up, we added a buffer , and it came out sort of at a level that was well\nbelow where we were in September. And yet we saw , actually , in September that reserves —the\nmarkets acted as though reserves had become scarce.\nSo what had happened was that liquidity , which actually existed , didn ’t flow into the repo\nmarket , and that had effects on the federal funds rate. So the question is, why did that happen?\n\nAnd we ’ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened. T here\nare—there are payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues\nraised —we ’re looking carefully at those. We ’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and\nregulatory practice in ways that don ’t undermine safety and soundness , and a number of ideas are\nunder —under examination there. To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off , really , on\nSeptember 17 with overnight operations . By October 11 we had cr eated and put into effect a\nplan. T hat plan is in effect. It ’s working. I think , for the last couple of months, repo markets\nhave been functioning well, short -term rates are stable, markets are functioning.\nSo you asked about year -end. T emporary upward pressures on short -term money market\nrates are not unusual around year -end. And our —both our repo operations and Treasury bill\npurchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal\nfunds rate. We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the\ndetails of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Our\nstrategy has been —essentially , the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term\nthrough—through both overnight and term repo, a nd, at the same time, we ’re raising the\nunderlying level of reserves through bill purchases. I ’ll take that now.\nWe’ve said bills —bill purchases. We’ve also said that we were willing to ad apt our\nstrategy. We ’re not at this place , but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short -\nterm coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if —if the need arises. So —but we\ndon’t—we don’t —we ’re not in that place . It looks —it very much looks li ke the bill —so those\nbill purchases are going well , just according to expectations. I mean, the other thing I ’ll say is\nthat we ’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time. We ’ll be\n\nproviding— we’ll be continuing that , and we ’re prepared to adjust our tactics. We’ re—we’re\nfocused on—on year -end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. The follow -up to t hat would be , where are we with the possibility\nof a standing repo facility?\nCHAIR POW ELL. So, on the standing repo facility, as you know , we’ve actually had a\ncouple of meetings where we’ ve discussed that. I think the standing repo facility is something\nthat’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place. At the moment\nwhat we ’re focused on is, you know —we ’re now focused on year -end. I should also mention\nthat after the year -end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because\nof bill purchases , as that happens , there will come a time when it will be appropriate for\novernight and term repo to gradually decline. We don’ t know —we can ’t know today what the\ntiming of that will be , but that ’s the way —that’s the way we see it going over time.\nHEATHER L ONG. Heather Lo ng from the Washington Post. A number of your\ncolleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until\ncore inflation is back at 2 percent. They think there should be a rule. Where do you personally\nstand on that ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as I mentioned , actually , at the last press conference, we think\nour policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in\nkeeping with our —with our outlook. And in order to move rates up, I would want to see\ninflation that’ s persistent and that ’s significant —a significant move -up in inflation that ’s also\npersistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns. That ’s my view.\nHEATHER LONG. S o is this de facto policy of the C ommittee then? I guess I ’m\nwondering why it ’s not sort of codified in a statement.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven ’t—we haven’t tried to turn it into some sort of, you know,\nofficial forward guidance. It happens to be my view that that ’s what it would take to want to\nmove interest rates up in order to deal with inflation.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. Just\nfollowing up on Heather ’s question —so if you look at the SEP today, it looks l ike inflation is\nnever overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are\nincreasing in 2021. So, I guess , how do we square that circle , with interest rates increasing\nbefore inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think what you’ re seeing is, you’ ve got a full year of the median\nbeing flat , which is , we think, accommodative, modestly accommodat ive, and inflation not\nmoving up very much, as we’ ve discussed. And that underscores , I think , the challenge of\ngetting inflation to move up. The C ommittee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at\n2 percent , for—ever since I arrived in 2012. And it hasn ’t happened, and it ’s just —it’s because\nthere are disinflationary forces around the world , and they’ ve been stronger than, I think , people\nunderstood them to be.\nIn terms of those out -year rate increases, what ’s you’ re—you ’re looking at rate in creases\nmore than a year into the future , and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why\nthey do that, but we —really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like\nin 2021. So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that , over time , it would\nbe appropriate —if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent , it would be appropriate for\nyour rates to move up in that direction. I will also say to you that a number of people wrote\ndown, and you can’ t see this at this level of detail, but—today —but a number of people did write\ndown overshoots of inflation as appropriate —under appropriate policy.\n\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times. Given that\ninflation —whichever measure you choose —ha s either sort of remain ed where it is or not\nincreased over the past year as you ’ve been dropping the policy rate , what is it that gives you\nconfidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you\njust indicated th at some people are considering doing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, it ’s just that there is still, empirically , by many, many\ndifferent —by the work of many different analysts , there is a relationship between resource\nutilization , by which I mean unemployment , and i nflation . It’s just relatively weak. And, by the\nway, that ’s not a bad thing. T hat means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have\na historically good—in some dimensions —labor market without having to worry about inflation.\nIt also means, though, that it’ s not easy to move inflation up.\nNow, you say, why is there confidence? I mean, I would say there ’s more humility than\nthere is confidence in this at this point. It ’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.\nIf you look ar ound the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but\nstill hasn ’t quite been able to achieve it. And I would also point out that this year , which has\nbeen a good year for the economy, inflation —core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent,\nwhereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year. So it’s —it’s a real challenge, and— but I\nthink we ’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal. So, Chair Powell, I want to\nask about the framework review , which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing\nan overshoot of the 2 percent target. And in that —in that context , is merely saying that you want\ninflation to rise above 2 percent a sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or\nwould it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that\n\noutcome if that ’s the direction in which the C ommittee goes ? In other words , it’s one thing to\naccept inflation rising on its own opportunistically. B ut if inflation does not materialize , would a\nchange in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I —you know, I think the answer to the questio n of whether\nsaying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is “ no.” And I think you have to back\nthat up with policy that supports the outcome , and that ’s what we ’re trying to do. And so the —\nthe changes that we ’re looking at to the framew ork are —I think they take all of that on board,\nand—but they’ re—what they’ re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of\nthat—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy. Ultimately, it will take time to\nestablish —to move inflation expectations up from where they are , which appears to be a bit\nbelow 2 percent , will not happen overnight . It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.\nYou know, the Fed has great inflation credibility , but inflation expectations ar e anchored at about\ntheir 25- year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. We talked a lot about inflation —Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness Network. We talked a lot about inflation. I want to ask you about uncertainty. With\nthe House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do\nyou see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade\ntensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business\ninvestments pick up?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I did see the news today that it appears there ’s an agreement to\nmove forward to vot e on USMCA, and, of course , it’s not our role to comment on particular\ntrade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them. I will say , though, that\ngetting—if the deal were to be enacted , then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy\n\nuncertainty, and that would be , I believe , a positive for the economy. And I ’ll say the same thing\nabout the negotiations with China, which haven ’t reached that point yet.\nWe’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and\nbusinesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the\nBeige Book, and they’ ve been telling us all year —for a year and a half , really , that trade policy\nuncertainty is weighing on the outlook. And I do think that, again, without commenting on it —\nin any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think tha t uncertainty —removal of\nuncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Is one uncertainty bigger than the other ? Is—do you see —not\ncommenting on the deals themselves , is one uncertainty—\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I thin k you can—you know, it ’s—I think you can see that\nwhat ’s been moving—one way to look at it is , what ’s been moving financial markets ? It’s been\nnews about the negotiations with China, not so much USMC A. I think the difference between\nNAFTA and USMCA is —is smaller than the difference between current, you know,\narrangements with China and what ’s being negotiated.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg. Chair Powell, the Fed\npolicy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the infla tion side of the mandate\nand the need to shore up inflation expectations. But it seems like the message you ’ve been\ngetting from the Fed Listens events and also something else you’ ve recently acknowledged is\nthat, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout\nthis expansion. So I ’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the\nreview is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well. Are there any possibilities, you\n\nknow, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to\nunemployment? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So the —you know, the focus really is on how to use our\nstrategi es, tools , and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate. And you’ re right,\nthough, that we ’ve talked here a lot about inflation. And I think that the —I think , more broadly,\nover a period of years —many years —we ’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment\nis lower . It’s just been —it’ s in estimates not just at the Fed , but among —broadly among\neconomists —labor economists have seen that the connection —that we can sustain much lower\nlevels of unemployment than had been thought . And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing\nbecause that means we—we don’ t have to worry so much about inflation. And that ’s—and you\nsee the benefits of that in today ’s labor market.\nI—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they\nare about maximum employment. If you’ve —if you’ve listen ed to or attended any of those, the\ndiscussion —we always focus on inflation as well , but the discussion is really around what ’s\nhappening in low - and moderate -income communities and among small businesses. And I think\nyou—you get a perspective , which —you know, we were already getting that from our extensive\noutreach to community groups and such. But it was help to get —helpful to get it in the context\nof a monetary policy review. And I think that the fact that these communities have so much—\nsuch high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there\nis slack out there. And I think that does also infor m our understanding of what we mean by\n“maximum employment .”\nAnd it’s been a very positive —I would say that the Fed Listens events have been —have\nbeen extraordinarily positive , and they’ re certainly something w e’ll repeat. You also see from\n\nthe business p erspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to —you know, to look\nthrough things on people ’s résumés that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of\nenvironments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot —there are a lot of things going on that\nsuggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances,\nwhich is a great thing.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. T hanks. Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly —is there any\nway to sort of systematize these insights , do you think, with, you know, in terms of —we talk a\nlot about , for example , makeup strategies on the inflation side . Is there anything similar you\ncould do on the employment side?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I —I think we have kind of internalized —and this isn’ t—\nthis isn’t news for today, this is something we ’ve been saying for, you know, for several years —\nyou’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the —of maximum employment. In fact , it’s\nalready —it’s already understood, I think, that —that there ’s more —even though we ’re at\n3½ percent unemployment , there ’s actually more slack out there, in a sense. A nd—and the risks\nof, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool , to explore that are relatively low.\nAnd I think we know that , and I think the review certainly underscores that , but that’s —that ’s a\nvery important insight.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask more about the —\nthe repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations. Ar e you currently,\nfor example , telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes?\nAre you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their\naccount at the Fed? And on the standing repo facility , is it, you know, that you would be\n\ninclined to do it , but you need to figure out the details ? Or—or what would kind of drive the\ndecision on whether or not to do that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we ’ve done a ton of work on that.\nWe’ve talked to supervisors , and—it ’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’ re all over the\nplace on the composition of their —of their buffer. So you have to have —you have a business\nmodel , and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be , and that suggests\nwhat your buffer should be. And you see them making quite different choices. Some of them\nhave lots of reserves and, you know, fewer T reasuries, and then they change their mind and they\nswitch, so i t’s not obvious that there ’s one thing happening there. Notwithstanding that, we\nhave —we’ve gone out to try to understand that , talking to supervisors.\nIn terms of the —the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet ;\nwe’ve taken it as exogenous. I don’ t know that at some point we won’ t have those discussions ,\nbut, you know, Treasury —we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs. And then\nwe should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our —to our work . And, you know,\nthere may come a time when we —when we talk about that, but we haven’ t done much of that.\nStanding repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it? What\nare we—I mean, I —so I think we’re —we are more focused , frankly, on the T —the bill\npurchases, t he year -end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we ’re\ndigging into, and—because we think, you know, there ’s—these are structural things —right? —\nwhere you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the —allow the liquidity\nthat is already there to flow more freely , perhaps by making fairly straightforward,\nnoncontroversial changes . And we think there is some of that , though—a nd so we ’re working\nhard and fast. But those are things, you know, the —if they take rule changes, it ’ll take, you\n\nknow, a notice of public rulemaking—i t’ll take three months and things like that. Those things\ntake time. These things that we’ re working on now , though—like, you know, going through\nyear-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are —those\nare things we have to do right now and are doing.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I wanted to ask,\nthe only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the\neconomy. You seem very confident that —or it implies there ’s a lot of confidence that those\nuncertainties have gone away. What caused you to make that change for the statement? What\nwere you looking at that seemed to be so much lower ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we did , actually —if you look at the statement, you’ ll notice\nthat we —we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the\nstatement. And why did we do that? You know, those are the things that we ’ve been monitoring\nall year. We ’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things ,\nso we ’re not revisiting that. But those are —those are just key things , and they haven’ t gone\naway , so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there —still subject to the idea that, for\nus to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, just to follow real qu ick, on the material—material\nreassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year?\nWe were talking about rate hikes, but no—no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next\nyear. Some economist s do. Does a material reassessment mean you need to see data actually\nworsen? Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way , arguably, you did this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, I mean, one thing that we ’re mindful of is that we ’ve cut rates\nthree times since Ju ly. That ’s 75 basis points ’ worth of cuts. And we do believe that monetary\n\npolicy operates with long and variable lags , and that it will take some time before the full effects\nof those actions are seen in the economy. So that ’ll take some time. So that ’s one reason to hold\nback and—and wait. And we thought —I think we took strong measures. In fact, if you look\nat—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points. So\nyou’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.\nIn terms of what ’s—you know, what is material at the end of the day, w ell, I would just\nsay, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective\njudgme nt of the FOMC. There isn ’t any single factor that will determine our decisions. We’ll—\nwe’ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR. You started out\nby talking about Paul Volcker , who obviously cast a —a long shadow. I wonder if , in hindsight ,\nthat shadow was—was too long, and if —in the decades since his tenure and , in particular, last\nyear, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack an inflation bogeyman that didn ’t\nmaterialize.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I —this wouldn’ t be a —my response will not be about Paul\nVolcker , but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker. So, if you look back at 2018 —I’ll just\ntake you back to the beginning of 2018. We had an economy growing at 3 percent , we had\ninflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars ’ worth of stimulus arriving, a nd the\nfederal funds rate was 1.4 percent. So it wasn ’t that —so we moved—we moved policy up\nduring the course of the year. We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the\nneutral rate was at th e time. So there was no sense of it being restrictive. We took steps to make\nit less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing. It still seems to m e to be the right\nthing in hindsight. The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—w e\n\nwere really just trying to get near neutral. A nd even with the last rate increase a year ago, we\nwere still meaningfully below the median estimate o n the Com mittee of what the neutral\nrate was. So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.\nI think what ’s happened is , the—obviously, the facts on the ground have change d. You\nsaw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then\ncontinue to go on this year, so you’ ve seen a continual weakening. Just look at the IM F’s\nforecast s of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now. You’ve had\nquite a significant —that does affect us. I think , also, the trade situation was just beginning in the\nmiddle of ’ 18, and I think it had —has had—you know, I think the re’ll be a very, very wide range\nof estimates of the effect , but I think it ’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the\nuncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent , through—through, you know, the tariff effects. And ,\nagain, that ’s not to make a judgment. It’ s not up to us to make a judgment about that. So, that ’s\nwhat —that would be my story.\nDONNA BORAK. Chair Powell, D onna Borak with CNN. To follow up on Edward’ s\ntrade question , could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if\nnegotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy\nin that event?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I wouldn’ t want to speculate on —on a hypothetical . I\nwould say—we’ll just have to see. W e’re—we look at a range of factors and we ’ve—as I ’ve\nsaid before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations. We t ry not\nto react. We can ’t react. Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to\nvolatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth a s this has\n\nhappened, as is probably typical of a —of a large complex negotiation. So, in terms of —you\nknow, I —again, I don’ t want to get into hypothetical outcomes , though, if that ’s all right.\nDONNA BORAK. I’m just wondering, you met with the President last month. Did you\nhave any advice for him when it c ame to this, and did you express some concerns about the\npotential volatility and the impact of the economy on—given all this?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I —I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors ’\nlongtime practice of not discussing private meetings w ith elected officials—or other officials ,\nreally . But thank you.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Thank you. Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse.\nYesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the\nPresident. Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as —today as\npotentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. We have not. We don’ t consider things like that.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby with Dow Jones News wires. Does the Fed ’s dot plot\nstill serve a useful communications purpose , or do you feel that it might be time to retire it or\nchange it in some fashion?\nCHAIR POWELL. With —I think properly understood, it can be useful , but that ’s been a\nchallenge. You know, I think “ properly understood” to me means looking at what it is and not at\nwhat it isn ’t. And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee\nmembers about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy. Remember tha t we\nwrite all that down , and we send it in , and it gets compiled. But we don’ t discuss it at the\nmeeting , and we don’ t negotiate a plan. There is no—t here’s no agreement. There ’s no plan.\n\nAnd I think, particularly at inflection points, it’ s hard to convey the reality , which is that\npolicy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook.\nAnd when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are —they’re just not a consideration.\nWe’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy. And if the fact —dots that\nwe did six months ago or three months ago don’ t agree with that, that ’s not even in the\nconversation. So its more —but it can it be useful if —and I think—but , as I said, it ’s been a\nchallenge , and so I —I do—I do like to say , if you focus too much on the dots, you can—you can\nmiss the broader picture.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chairman Powell, many people seem\nworried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be —the results are going to\nbe less rather than more. And I —people keep coming back and saying why—asking why you\ntook off , like , a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started. I mean, as you said ,\ngoing around the country for all the Listen events, I don’ t think I heard anybody worry about a\n4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem. So where\ndoes that concern come from? Is it members of Congress that have—have said this?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. S o let me say , we’re—we’ve been working on this all year.\nAnd we ’re just at the stage where we’ ve had a really interesting discussion about the various\ntools that we have at the October meeting. At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary\npolicy affects different groups in the economy. So we had a —we talked about the Fed Listens\nevents and some very interesting research. So we ’re just getting to the stage where we ’re\nlooking at conclusions . You know , what do we take away from all this? And those things —\nmany of those things would wind up as changes , if you will, modifications to the “Statement of\nLonger -Run G oals and Monetary P olicy S trategy. ” I think that process will take until the midd le\n\nof the year where —but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully. And that is —\nin effect, that is our framework document. And I wouldn’ t prejudge. No one —I believe we will\nbe able to —to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements. I do.\nIn terms of “ 4 percent ”—so that ’s—I think it ’s premature for people to be saying that this\nisn’t going anywhere. You know —and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation\ntarget—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation targe t. So I ’ll go back to the point that just\nsaying words is not itself credible. So I think if you said, “W e’re raising the inflation target to\n4,” what would be the effect of that? I mean, where’ s the credibility in that, really? You haven’ t\nbeen able to get it to 2. So I think we —I think you need to lower your sights a little bit. I also\nthink, is 4 percent —you ’d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability? Is\nthat really price stability? Is that within our legal mandate? I mean , I think it’ s a fair question.\nSo, you know, I think— I’d like for this review to come out with very— a set of positive\nresults—you know, meaningful improvements. It doesn’ t mean it has to solve every problem\ngoing forward. We want to —we want to have this be a successful exercise where we\nmeaningfully improve our monetary policy framework. These things don ’t tend to move in —\nyou know, in a lurchy way, t hey tend to evolve. But I think —and if we do this , then in a few\nyears, again and again and things like that , then we can —at least we’ re moving in a good\ndirection. And I think we will be. I’m confident we will be.\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. Chair Powell, you’ ve had a busy year , and I ’m\nwondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently. A nd are there any\nlessons that you would take into next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know , I have to say, my total focus is on right now and\ngetting policy right and thinking about next year —you know, thinki ng about what ’s the economy\n\ngoing to be doing. I like where we are on policy, as I mentioned. I think our policy stance is\nappropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this. You know —I\nmean, it ’s too long of a question. Yo u know, I don’ t know how to get after that. There ’s—\nthere’s a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our\njobs. And, you know, we ’re always going to be trying to learn lessons.\nDON LEE. I mean, are there any part icular surprises, whether it ’s the economy or how\nmarkets or financial —\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I—s o, ye s. I didn’ t—obviously, you know, didn’ t see and I\ndon’t think anybody saw coming the —the challenges that we faced this year. I think they were a\nsurprise. I think that , toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at\naround 3 percent. And I didn’ t expect the —to face the challenges, but I think we did face them ,\nand I think we —I’m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did. I\nthink our moves will prove appropriate. And , again, I think both the economy and monetary\npolicy right now , I think , are in a good place.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.\nChair Powell, wh y aren ’t we seeing stronger wage gains? Wages are growing more slowly now\nthan they were toward the beginning of the year. Why is that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, wage gains have moved up a bit. If you look back three , four\nyears, you’ ll see wages are growing around 2 percent. Now you see them moving up, you know,\nmore at 3, 3½ percent. So why aren ’t they growing higher, at a faster rate? And it ’s a couple of\nthings. I think there are a range of explanations. For instance, one would be that productivity\nhas just been low. So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity. Productivity has\nbeen low , and that —that is very likely to be holding back wages. I also think there are other\n\npossible potential explanations , such as, you know, globalization can be —the idea that you can\nmake, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. I\nthink that hangs over the wage -setting process— and everywhere , pretty much. You don’ t see—\nthere i sn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market.\nAnother thing is , though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it\nwas. And, you know, I think there —there are many, many possible explanations. I will say ,\nthough, if you look, for example , at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are —\ntheir wages are going up at 3.7 percent. And so, you do see —and wages are going up the most\nfor people at the lower end of the —that ’s been true for the last couple of years —lower end of the\nwage spectrum. So you do see wages moving up. It’s just—they’re not moving up at —at very\nhigh rates. And, again , at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Can I ask a quick follow -up? Just as far as the market\nnot being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who\ncould join the labor force?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, y es. And I would also say that we —if you ask people, and we\ndid ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is? People were writing\ndown numbers in the fives , and then they were writing down numbers in the fours. And now,\nunemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half , and we still s ee wage inflation , as you\nmentioned. The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, a lthough, there may be\ncompositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent , about younger\nworkers coming in at lower wages that —than retiring w orkers .\nBut you wouldn’ t—that shouldn’ t have much of an effect , actually. So why is that ? It\nmay just be that there ’s more slack in the economy. And I think we are seeing that. We’re\n\nseeing —really , it showed up through higher participation. For many years, we’ve thought that\nthere ’s a trend decline in participation. Notwithstanding that, against that trend , we’ve seen\nprime -age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years. And it’s a\nvery positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor\nmarket.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. Hannah Lang with American Banker. Thanks for being here\ntoday. I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act , since the FDIC and OCC\nmay pot entially join together with a —for a proposal without the Fed. Are you concerned that\nthis might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized\nwithout the Fed?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we think the CRA —we know the CRA is a very\nimportant law , and we ’re strongly committed to the mission of e nsuring that banks provide credit\nto their—throughout their communities , particularly addressing the needs of low - and moderate -\nincome households and neighborhoods. We also think it ’s time for modernization. We ’ve\nthought that for some time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC , really ,\non—on a proposal. And my hope is that we can still do that . You know , I don’ t know whether\nthat’ll be possible or not. It will have to —well, we’ll just have to see , but—and if we —if we\ncan’t, I don’ t—I’m not sure what the path forward would be. We would certainly not want to\ncreate confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be\nslightly different regimes. So that ’s something we —I hope we don’ t have to face , but we will if\nwe have to.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. So , before the July\nmeeting, you said something kind of colorful. You said, “ To call something ‘hot,’ you would\n\nneed to see some heat, ” referring to the labor market. So to expand a bit, I guess , on Nancy’ s\nquestion, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already , but what\nwould you need to see to call the labor market “ hot” in that case? Would it be a contract —or,\nrather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in t he unemployment rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. Really, wages. I mean, we —there’s so many other measures that\nsuggest that the labor market is —I like to say the labor market is strong. I don’ t really want to\nsay that it ’s tight. Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market —that was in the\nHumphrey- Hawkins hearings. S o I’ll say that the labor market is strong. I don’ t know that it ’s\ntight, because you ’re not seeing wage increases, you know. Ultimately , if it’s tight, those should\nbe—should be reflected in higher wage increases, so it does come down to that. You know, we\nlook at countless measures of labor market —you know, labor utilization, and there ’s so many —\nit’s too many to count. But the one that has —that is kind of suggesting that you’ re—it’s a\nhealthy number that, you know, the sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a\ndecent number —3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy.\nUltimately , though, we ’d like to see —to call it “ hot,” you’ d want to see heat. You ’d want to see,\nyou know, higher wages. Thanks."
