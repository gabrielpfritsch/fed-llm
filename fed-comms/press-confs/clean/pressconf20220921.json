  "text": "September 21 , 2022\n\nCHAIR POWELL . Good afternoon . My colleagues and I are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal . We have both the tools we need and the\nresolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses .\nPrice stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our\neconomy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone . In particular, without\nprice stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all .\nToday the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate\nthat ongoing increases w ill be appropriate . We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a\nlevel that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet . I will have more to\nsay about today’ s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments .\nThe U.S . economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which\nreflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recessi on. Recent indicators\npoint to modest growth of spending and production. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’ s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial\nconditions . Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates . Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be\nweighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports . As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June , FOMC participants\nhave marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real\n\nGDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the\nmedi an estimate of the longer -run normal growth rate .\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth\nelevated . Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per\nmonth over the last three months . The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand\nfor workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers . The labor force\nparticipation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of\nthe year . FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come\ninto better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices . The median\nprojection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections . Over the next three years, the median\nunemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer -run normal level.\nInflation remains well above our 2 percent longer- run goal . Over the 12 months ending\nin July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent . In August, the 12 -month change in the consumer p rice i ndex was\n8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent . Price pressures remain evident\nacross a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year -earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia ’s war against\nUkraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflat ion is 5.4 percent this\nyear and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025. P articipants\ncontinue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside .\n\nDespite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear t o remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as\nwell as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people . My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to b oth sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective .\nAt today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3 ¼ perc ent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent . We anticipate that ongoing increases in the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outl ook for the economy. With\ntoday’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year . At some point, as\nthe stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our c umulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and\n\ninflation . We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our\nthinking as clearly as possible.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive po licy stance for\nsome time . The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy . As\nshown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is\n4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage p oint higher than projected in June . The median\nprojection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer -run value . Of course, these projections do not\nrepresent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now.\nWe are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better\nalignment with supply . Our overarching focus is usi ng our tools to bring inflation back down to\nour 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored . Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth, and there will very likely\nbe some softening of labor market conditions . Restoring price stability is essential to set the\nstage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run . We will keep\nat it until we are confident the job is done .\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country . Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .\nThank you, and I look forw ard to your questions.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. T hank you for taking our questions . Jeanna\nSmialek from t he New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how\n\nyou’ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you’ ll eventually know when\nto stop.\nCHAIR POWELL . So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to\nstart here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The\nFOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflati on down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the\njob is done . So the way we ’re thinking about this is , the overarching focus of the Committee is\ngetting inflation back down to 2 percent . To accomplish that, we think we ’ll need to do two\nthings , in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor\nmarket conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market.\nSo on the first, the Committee ’s forecast s and those of most outside forecasters do show\ngrowth running below its longer -run potential this year and next year . On the second , though, so\nfar there ’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off . Job openings are down a\nbit, as you know ; quits are off their all- time highs ; there ’s some signs that some wage measures\nmay be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much. And in\nlight of the high inflation we ’re seeing, we think we ’ll need to—and in light of w hat I just said,\nwe think that we ’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for\nsome time .\nSo, what will we be looking at , I guess , is your question. So we ’ll be looking at a few\nthings . First, we ’ll want to see growth c ontinuing to run below trend, we ’ll want to see\nmovements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately , we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent .\nSo that ’s what we’ll be looking for . In terms of reducing rates, I think we ’d want to be very\nconfident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that .\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Thank you, Mr . Chairman . Steve Liesman, CNBC . Can you talk\nabout how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for\nrates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates ? Well, can you envision a\ntime when there ’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate\nincreases? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure . So, of course , monetary policy does , famously , work with long\nand variable lags . The way I think of it is , our policy decisions affect financial conditions\nimmediately . In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually\nannounce our decisions . Then , changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity\nfairly quickly, within a few months . But it’ s likely to take some time to see the full effects of\nchanging financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that . And that ’s\nwhy I noted in my opening remarks that , at some point, as the stance of poli cy tightens further, it\nwill become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation . So that ’s how we think about that .\nYour second question—sorry —was?\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Is there a point in time you could see pausing? Is it linear? Do you\nkeep raising rates, or is there—oh, sorry , I should know better than to not talk with a\nmicrophone.\nCHAIR POWELL . I should know better than to answer your second question.\n[Laughte r]\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Well , there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates , or is\nthere a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the\n\neconomy and give time to catch up in the real economy—the rate increase time to catch up in the\nreal economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So I think it ’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is\ngoing to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our\npolicy rate to a restrictive level that’ s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent,\nwhere we have confidence of that . And what you see in the SEP numbers is people ’s views as of\ntoday, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate .\nNow, those will evolve over time , and I think we ’ll just have to see how that goes . There\nis a possibility , certainly , that we would go to a certain level that we ’re confident in and stay\nthere for a time . But we ’re not at that level. C learly , today we ’re, we’ve just moved, I think,\nprobably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive , and, certainly , in my view and\nthe view of the Committee, there ’s a ways to go .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Rachel .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post . Thank\nyou for taking our questions . The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent\nnext year, and, historically , that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a\nrecession with it . Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise\nnecessary to get inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So you’ re right—in the SEP, there ’s what I would\ncharacterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So , really, that is what\nwe generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a\nnumber of ways , and I ’ll mention a couple of those . First—and you know these —but first, job\n\nopenings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work. It’ s plausible,\nI’ll say , that job openi ngs could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much\nof an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes . So that ’s one\nthing.\nIn addition, in this cycle, longer -run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well\nanchored, and , as I ’ve said, there ’s no basis for complacency there. B ut to the extent that\ncontinues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability . And I guess the\nthird thing I would point to that ’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this\nseries of supply shocks that we ’ve had, beginning with the pandemic , and, really , with the\nreopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia ’s invasion of\nUkraine —have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation .\nSo these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in\nprinciple, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of\nthat. It’s not much more than that, but it ’s good to see that . For example, commodity prices look\nlike they may have peaked for now ; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those\ndevelopments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.\nSo let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence\nof events —it remains to be seen . We have always understood that restoring price stability while\nachieving a relatively modest decline —or, rather , increase—in unemployment and a soft l anding\nwould be very challenging. A nd we don’ t know —no one knows whether this process will lead\nto a recession or , if so, how significant that recession would be . That ’s going to depend on how\nquickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored,\nand whether , also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well .\n\nIn addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy\nneeds to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. No netheless, we’ re committed to getting\ninflation back down to 2 percent —because we think that a failure to restore price stability would\nmean far greater pain later on .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Just to follow up on one small thing—are vacancies still at the top of\nyour list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people .\nThat and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how\ndifferent it is from other cycles, where , generally , the unemployment rate itself is the single best\nindicator . We think those things have , for quite a time now, really added value in terms of\nunderstanding where the labor market is .\nMICHELLE SM ITH. Nick .\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . You said not too long\nago, in describing the policy destination, there ’s still a way to go . But I imagine you have to\nhave some idea about how you’ re thinking about your destination, w hether it ’s a stopping point\nor a pausing point . And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as\nthe data come in, where that destination is, how it ’s moving up. I f inflation doesn ’t perform as\nyou expect, do you want to have a policy rate that ’s above the underlying inflation rate, for\nexample, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be\nin the economy right now ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well , so, again, we believe that we need to raise our poli cy stance\noverall to a level that is restrictive—a nd by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful\ndownward pressure on inflation. That ’s what we need to see in the stance of policy . We also\n\nknow that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation . So it ’s a\nchallenging assessment . So, what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions, as\nyou know ; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit\nspreads ; you look at financial conditions indexes .\nWe also, I would think— and you see this in the —this is something we talked about today\nin the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings . And you see this , I think, in the Committee\nforecast . You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.\nAnd I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we ’re writing down and think\nabout —you measure those against some sort of forward -looking assessment of inflation,\ninflation expectations . I think you would see at that time —you ’d see positive real rates across\nthe yield curve , and that is also an important consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Howard .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi . Howard Schneider with Reuters . Thanks for the\nopportunity. I just want to be clear on the SEPs . You say it ’s meeting by meeting, but it sure\nlooks like we ’re going 75–50–25. I s 75 next month the baseli ne?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we make one decision per meeting , and the decision we made\ntoday was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points] . You’re right that the median for\nthe year -end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there ’s also, there ’s another\nfairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be\n25 basis points less . So we ’re going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn’ t make that\ndecision today; we didn’ t vote on that . I would say that we ’re committed to getting to a\nrestrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly , and that ’s what we ’re\nthinking about .\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, just as a follow -up to that, I ’m wondering about the sort\nof risk -management considerations here , given there ’s some discussion now of overdoing it .\nWhat ’s the incentive to continue front -loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen\nin the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much d one while the job market is still as\nstrong as it is?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, what we ’ve seen is, inflation has —our expectation has been that\nwe would begin to see inflation come down, l argely because of supply- side healing . By now we\nwould have thought that w e’d have seen some of that . We haven ’t. We have seen some supply -\nside healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is\na good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3- , 6-, and 12- month\ntrailing annualized basis, you’ ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent .\nSo that ’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation . And that ’s not where we\nexpected or wanted to be . So, what that tells us is that w e need to continue , and we can —keep\ndoing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to . And we ’re still discovering what that level is . But people are writing that\ndown in their SEP where they think policy needs to be . So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Let ’s go to Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times . Chair Powell,\nhow should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to\ntarget in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024? And does that mean there ’s a\nlevel of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median —and headline is at\n2.0, so that ’s pretty close . I mean , we write down our forecasts , and we figure out what the\n\nmedian is , and we publish it . So it’s not —I mean , I would say that if, actually , if the economy\nfollowed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome . But you’ re right—it is a tenth higher\nthan 2 percent.\nCOLBY SMITH. Okay . Just as a quick follow -up: I mean , if the concern is that\nunderlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps , each month, then why forgo the\nmore aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah . So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between\nthat one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming\nin. So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high\nreading for August . So I think you have to—you can’ t really —you never want to overreact too\nmuch to any one data point .\nSo if you look at them together —and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year ’s\ninflation, 3 -, 6-, and 12- month trailing, you see inflation is running too high. It’ s running\n4.5 percent or above ; you don’ t need to know much more than that . If that’ s the one thing you\nknow, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance\nof policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. That ’s how we\nthink about it .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Victoria .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico . I wanted to ask about the\nbalance sheet . You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage -backed\nsecurities, but we’ ve seen significant slowing in the housing market . Mortgage rates have gone\nup significantly, and I’m just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for\nhow quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side .\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that\nonce balance sheet runoff is well under way . I would say it ’s not something we ’re considering\nright now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term . It’s just, it ’s something\nI think we will turn to , but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is no t close.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?\nCHAIR POWELL . I think a number of things might affect that decision, really . The\nmain thing is, we ’re not considering that decision , and I don’ t expect that we will an y time soon.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN . Thanks . Neil Irwin with Axios . A number of commentators have come\nto the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the\nworld is, creates a risk of a glo bal recession that ’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation\ndown. How do you see that risk? How do you think of coordination with your fellow central\nbankers? And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we, actually , my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC\ncolleagues and I , just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with\nother senior central bank officials from around the world . We are in pretty regular contact, and\nwe exchange, of course —we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the\ndual mandate, maximum employment and price stability . But we regularly discuss what we’ re\nseeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it ’s a very ongoing,\nconstant kind of a process .\nSo we are very aware of what ’s going on in other economies around the world and what\nthat means for us, and vice versa . The forecast s that we put together, that our staff puts together,\nand that we put together on our own always take all of that —try to take all of that into account . I\n\nmean , I can ’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’ s not as if we don ’t think about the policy\ndecisions —monetary policy and otherwise —the economic developments that are taking place in\nmajor economies that can have an effect on the U.S . economy. T hat is very much baked into our\nown forecast and our own understanding of the U.S . economy, as best we can . It won ’t be\nperfect .\nSo I don’ t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very\ndifferent levels of interest rates . If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and\nthings like that at various times , but, really, we ’re all, we ’re in very different situations . But I\nwill tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it ’s not coordination , but there ’s a lot of\ninformation sharing. A nd we all , I think, are informed by what other important economies —\neconomies that are important to the United States —are doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Craig .\nCRAIG TORRES . Craig Torres from Bloomberg . Chair Powell, you talked about some\nways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we ’ve also seen a resilient labor\nmarket with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I ’m wondering what your s tory is\non the resilience of the economy. A fter all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started\ntightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future .” And, indeed,\nTreasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tighte ning taking e ffect. Why is the\neconomy, in your view, so resilient , and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher\nterminal rate ?\nCHAIR POWELL . You ’re right, of course —the labor market, in particular , has been\nvery strong. But there are—the secto rs of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are\ncertainly showing the effects of our tightening , and , of course , the obvious example is housing,\n\nwhere you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down.\nSo we ’re having an effect on interest -sensitive spending. I think, through exchange rates , we’re\nhaving an effect on expo rts and imports . I think —so all of that ’s happening, but you ’re right,\nand we ’ve said this : This is a strong, robust economy. P eople have savings on their balance\nsheet from the period when they couldn’ t spend and where they were getting government\ntransfers . There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end\nof the income spectrum —but still, some savings out there to support growth. T he states are very\nflush with cash, so there ’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong\neconomy.\nNow, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year . We\nthink of trend as being about 1.8 percent , or in that range . We ’re forecasting growth well below\nthat, and most forecasters are. But you’ re right —there ’s certainly a possibility that growth can\nbe stronger than that . And that ’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more\nresistant to a significant downturn . But , of course , we are focused on the thing I started with,\nwhich is getting inflation back down to 2 percent . We can ’t fail to do that . I mean , if we were to\nfail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve .\nSo for now, that has to be our overarching focus , and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the\nlevels of rates that we’ ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in\nline with the SEP . So that ’s how we think about it .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Mike . Thank you.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Thank you, Mr . Chairman . In a world of euphemisms that we live in\nhere, with “below -trend growth” and “ modest increase in unemployment, ” I’m wondering if I can\nask you a couple of direct questions for the American people . Do the odds now favor, given whe re\n\nyou are and where you’ re going with interest rates, favor a recession ? Four point four percent\nunemployment is about 1.3 million jobs . Is that acceptable job loss? And then, given that the data\nyou look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don’ t\nknow what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you’ ve gone too far?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I don’ t know what the odds are . I think that there ’s a very high\nlikelihood that we ’ll have a period of what I ’ve me ntioned is below -trend growth, by which I\nmean much lower growth, and we ’re seeing that now . So the median forecast , I think , this year\namong my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth. So that ’s very slow growth. And then\nbelow trend next year . I think the median was 1.2, also well below . So that ’s a slower, that ’s a\nvery slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment . But I think\nthat’s, so that is something that we think we need to have , and we think we need to hav e softer\nlabor market conditions as well .\nWe’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is\nthis: Inflation —what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are\nsuffering from inflation . And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another\nperiod of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us . I wish there were a\npainless way to do that . There isn ’t. So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where\nwe’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that ’s what we ’re doing. And we\ncertainly don’ t hope, we certainly haven’ t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest\nincrease in unemployment . Nonetheless, we need to complete this t ask.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . But how will you know, or will you know , if you’ ve gone too far?\nCHAIR POWELL . It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean , again, our\nreally tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy ra te up where it\n\nneeds to be . And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’ s estimate of where we think those\nrates would be . Of course , they will evolve over time .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Chris Rugaber .\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks . Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I wanted to follow up\nwith what you just mentioned about the labor market . You’ve said several times that to have the\nlabor market we want, we need price stability , and you suggested maybe there isn ’t a tradeoff in\nthe long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern , as people have been expressing here,\nabout higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes . So can you\nexplain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to\nsuggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market . So can you spell\nthat out a little more for the general public on how that would work?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, for starters, people are seeing the ir wage increases eaten up by\ninflation . So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck\ncycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ ve been\ngoing up, you’ re in trouble right away . You don’ t have a cushion, and this is very painful for\npeople at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum . So that ’s what we ’re hearing from\npeople is , you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting .\nSo how do we get rid of inflation? And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a\nway to just wish it away , but there isn ’t. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment ,\nand the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully, we do that by slowing the\neconomy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution\nfrom supply -side improvements , and things like that . But none of that is guaranteed.\n\nIn any case, we, our job is to deliver price sta bility , and I think —you can think of price\nstability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time. We\nreally saw that for a long time . The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’ t move around\nmuch, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve . And we have to get back\nto that and keep it for another long period of time . To pull back from the task of doing that is,\nyou’re just postponing— the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to\nlead to more pain . So I think we ’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs , and that ’s\nwhat you see us doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thank you for taking the question, Mr . Chairman . Edward\nLawrence for Fox Busi ness. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some\neconomic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that\neconomic pain?\nCHAIR POWELL . How long? I mean , it really depends on how long it takes for wag es\nand, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down. And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that. And I think once you’ re on that path, that ’s a good thing.\nAnd things will start to feel better to people —they ’ll feel lower inflation, they ’ll feel that the\neconomy is improving. A nd also, if our projections are close to right, you’ ll see that the costs in\nunemployment are, they ’re meaningful, and they ’re certainly very meaningful to the people who\nlose their jobs . And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.\nBut, at the same time, we’ d be setting the economy up for another long period— this era\nhas b een noted for very long expansions . We’ve had three of the four longest in measured\n\nhistory since we got inflation under control . And that ’s not an accident . So when inflation is\nlow and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10- year, anyway, expansions , and you can see\nwhat we saw in 2018, ’ 19, and ’ 20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains\ngoing to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we ’ve seen since we\nstarted keeping track of that . So we want to get back to that . But, to get there , we’re going to\nhave to get supply and demand back in alignment , and that ’s going to take tight monetary policy\nfor a period of time .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . As a follow -up, what is that economic pain in your mind? Is\nit job loss es? Is it higher interest rates on credit cards? What is that economic pain?\nCHAIR POWELL . So it ’s all of those things . Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a\nsoftening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve . But they’ re not as painful as\nfailing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and\ndoing it at a time when , actually , now people have really come to expect high inflation. If the\nconcept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people ’s economic thinking about their\ndecisions, then sort of getting back to price stability —the cost of getting back to price stability\njust rises, and so we want to avoid that . We want to act aggressively now and get this job done\nand keep at it unti l it’s done .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nicole, from CNN .\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell . Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nBusiness. Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their\nhighest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week , and housing prices are still\nelevated . Now, a t the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the\n\nhousing market . I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say “ reset ”\nand what you think it will take to actually get there.\nCHAIR POWELL . So when I say “ reset, ” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of\ndata or anything. W hat I’m really saying is that we ’ve had a time of a red -hot housing market all\nover the country, where , famou sly, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the\nask, before even seeing the house . That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between\nsupply and demand. H ousing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level . So the\ndecel eration in housing prices that we ’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in\nline with rents and other housing market fundamentals , and that ’s a good thing.\nFor the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that\nhousing prices go up at a reasonable level —at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford\nhouses again . And I think we —so we probably , in the housing market , have to go through a\ncorrection to get back to that place. There ’s also, there are also longer -run issues, though, with\nthe housing market . As you know, we ’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities\nand things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and\nmaterials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Just to follow, though, s helter made up such a large part of this\nhot CPI report that we saw . Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down\nin the coming months? Or do you think that there ’s still this imbalance that needs to be\naddressed?\nCHAIR POWELL . I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time .\nWe’re looking for it to come down, but it ’s not exactly clear when that will happen . So it may\n\ntake some time, so I think , hope for the best, plan for the worst . So I think , on shelter inflation ,\nyou’ve just got to assume that it ’s going to remain pretty high for a while .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay, we ’ll go to Jean for the last question .\nJEAN YUNG. Hi . Jean Yung with Market News. You ’ve talked about the need to get\nreal rates into positive territory , and you sa id earlier that policy is just moving into that territory\nnow. So I ’m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected —is that expected to be next\nyear? How restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I think if you look, when we get to —if we —let ’s assume we do\nget to that level, which I think is likely . What you’ re going to do is , you’ re going to adjust that\nfor some forward -looking measure of inflation. And that could be —you pick your measure . It\ncould be —there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get —but what you’ ll get\nis a positive number . In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term , I\nthink, that are going to be, assuming that we ’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be\nsignificant .\nSo you’ ll have a positive [real] federal f unds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent\nor so, but —I mean, I don ’t know exactly what it would be . But it would be significantly positive\nwhen we get to that level . And let me say, we ’ve written down what we think is a plausible path\nfor the federal f unds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to\nrestore price stability . So this is something that, as you can see, they ’ve moved up, and we ’re\ngoing to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether\nour policy is in the right place as we go.\nThank you very much."
