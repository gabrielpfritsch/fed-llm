Earlier today, t he Federal Open Market Committ ee\ndecided to raise the target rang e for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point , bringing it to\n¼ to ½ percent.\nThis action marks the end of an e xtraordinary seven-year period during which the federal\nfunds rate was held near zero to s upport the recovery of the ec onomy from the worst financial\ncrisis and recession since the G reat Depression. It also recog nizes the considerable progress that\nhas been made toward restoring jobs, raising incomes, and easin g the economic hardship of\nmillions of Americans. And it refl ects the Committee’s confide nce that the economy will\ncontinue to strengthen. The econom ic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not\nyet complete. Room for further improvement in the labor market remains, and inflation\ncontinues to run below our longer-run objective. But with the economy performing well and\nexpected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a mode st increase in the federal funds\nrate target is now appropriate, r ecognizing that even after thi s increase, monetary policy remains\naccommodative. As I will explain, the process of normalizing i nterest rates is likely to proceed\ngradually, although future policy actions will obviously depend on how the economy evolves\nrelative to our objec tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\nSince March, the Committee has stated that it would raise the t arget range for the federal\nfunds rate when it had seen furth er improvement in the labor ma rket and was reasonably\nconfident that infla tion would move back t o its 2 percent objec tive over the medium term. In our\njudgment, these two criteri a have now been satisfied.\nThe labor market has clearly show n significant further improvem ent toward our objective\nof maximum employment. So far this year, a total of 2.3 millio n jobs have been added to the\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\neconomy, and over the most recent three months, job gains have averaged an estimated 218,000\nper month, similar to the avera ge pace since the beginning of t he year. The unemployment rate,\nat 5 percent in November, is dow n 0.6 percentage point from the end of last year and is close to\nthe median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run no rmal level. A broader measure\nof unemployment that includes i ndividuals who want and are avai lable to work but have not\nactively searched recently and pe ople who are working part time but would rather work full time\nalso has shown solid improvement . That said, some cyclical wea kness likely remains: The labor\nforce participation rate is st ill below estimates of its demogr aphic trend, involuntary part-time\nemployment remains somewhat el evated, and wage growth has yet t o show a sustained pickup.\nThe improvement in employment conditions this year has occurred amid continued\nexpansion in economic activit y. U.S. real gross domestic produ ct is estimated to have increased\nat an average pace of 2¼ percent ove r the first three quarters of the year. Net exports have been\nrestrained by subdued foreign grow th and the appreciation of th e dollar, but this weakness has\nbeen offset by solid expansion of domestic spending. Continued job gains and increases in real\ndisposable income have suppor ted household spending, and purcha ses of new motor vehicles\nhave been particularly strong. Res idential investment has been rising at a faster pace than last\nyear, although the level of new homebuilding still remains low. And outside of the drilling and\nmining sector, where lower oil pric es have led to substantial c uts in investment outlays, business\ninvestment has posted solid gains.\nThe Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market\nindicators will continue to strengthen. Although developments abroad still pose risks to U.S.\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\neconomic growth, these risks app ear to have lessened since last summer. Overall, the Committee\nsees the risks to the outlook f or both economic activity and th e labor market as balanced.\nThe anticipation of ongoing economic growth and additional impr ovement in labor\nmarket conditions is an importa nt factor underp inning the Commi ttee’s confidence that inflation\nwill return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. O verall consumer price inflation—\nas measured by the price index for personal consumption expendi tures—was only ¼ percent over\nthe 12 months ending in October. However, much of the shortfal l from our 2 percent objective\nreflected the sharp declines in e nergy prices since the middle of last year, and the effects of these\ndeclines should dissip ate over time. The appreciation of the d ollar has also weighed on inflation\nby holding down import prices. As th ese transitory influences fade and as the labor market\nstrengthens further, the Committ ee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term.\nThe Committee’s confidence in the inflation outlook rests impor tantly on its judgment\nthat longer-run inflation expecta tions remain well anchored. I n this regard, although some\nsurvey measures of longer-run in flation expectations have edged down, overall they have been\nreasonably stable. Market-base d measures of inflation compensa tion remain near historically\nlow levels, although the declines i n these measures over the pa st year and a half may reflect\nchanges in risk and liquidity pr emiums rather than an outright decline in inflati on expectations.\nOur statement emphasizes that , in considering future policy dec isions, we will carefully monitor\nactual and expected progre ss toward our inflation goal.\nThis general assessment of the outlook is reflected in the indi vidual economic projections\nsubmitted for this meeting by FOMC participants. As always, ea ch participant’s projections are\nconditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary poli cy. Participants’ p rojections for\nreal GDP growth are little cha nged from the projections made in conjunction with the September\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nFOMC meeting. The median projec tion for real GDP growth is 2.1 percent for this year and\nrises to 2.4 percent in 2016, somew hat above the median estimat e of the longer-run normal\ngrowth rate. Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer-run rate. The\nmedian projection for the unemploym ent rate in the fourth quart er of this year stands at\n5 percent, close to the median estimate of the longer-run norma l unemployment rate. Committee\nparticipants generally see the unemployment rate declining a li ttle further next year and then\nleveling out. The path of the med ian unemployment rate is slig htly lower than in September, and\nwhile the median longer-run normal unemployment rate has not ch anged, some participants\nedged down their estimates. ly, FOMC participants project inflation to be very low this\nyear, largely reflecting lower prices for energy and non-energy imports. As the transitory factors\nholding down inflation abate and labor market conditions contin ue to strengthen, the median\ninflation projection rises fro m just 0.4 percent this year to 1 .6 percent next year and reaches\n1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018. The path of the med ian inflation projec tions is little\nchanged from September.\nWith inflation currently still lo w, why is the Committee raisin g the federal funds rate\ntarget? As I have already note d, much of the recent softness i n inflation is due to transitory\nfactors that we expect to abat e over time, and diminishing slac k in labor and product markets\nshould put upward pressure on inf lation as well. In addition, we recognize that it takes time for\nmonetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes. We re the FOMC to delay the start\nof policy normalization for t oo long, we would likely end up ha ving to tighten policy relatively\nabruptly at some point to keep t he economy from overheating and inflation from significantly\novershooting our objective. Such a n abrupt tightening could in crease the risk of pushing the\neconomy into recession.\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nAs I have often noted, the importa nce of our initial increase i n the target range for the\nfederal funds rate should not be overstated: Even after today’ s increase, the stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improv ement in labor market\nconditions and a return to 2 percen t inflation. As we indicate d in our statement, “the Committee\nexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant only gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rat e; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below\nlevels that are expected t o prevail in the longer run.”\nThis expectation is consistent w ith the view that the neutral n ominal federal funds rate—\ndefined as the value of the fed eral funds rate that would be ne ither expansionary nor\ncontractionary if the econom y were operating near potential—is currently low by historical\nstandards and is likel y to rise only gradua lly over time. One indication that the neutral funds rate\nis unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been only mod erate in recent years despite the\nvery low level of the federal f unds rate and the Federal Reserv e’s very large holdings of longer-\nterm securities. Had the neutral rate been running closer to i ts longer-run level, these policy\nactions would have been expected to foster a much more rapid ec onomic expansion.\nThe marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate may be par tially attributable to a\nrange of persistent economic h eadwinds that have weighed on agg regate demand. Following the\nfinancial crisis, these headwinds included tighter underwriting standards and lim ited access to\ncredit for some borrowers, de leveraging by many households to r educe debt burdens,\ncontractionary fiscal policy, w eak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the\ndollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevate d uncertainty about the economic\noutlook. Although the restraint imp osed by many of these facto rs has declined noticeably over\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nthe past few years, some of the se effects have remained signifi cant. As these effects abate, the\nneutral federal funds rate s hould gradually move higher over ti me.\nThis view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary\npolicy. The median projection for t he federal funds rate rises gradually to nearly 1½ percent in\nlate 2016 and 2½ percent in late 201 7. As the factors restrain ing economic growth continue to\nfade over time, the median rate rises to 3¼ percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run\nnormal level. Compared with the p rojections made in September, a number of participants\nlowered somewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, althou gh changes to the median path are\nfairly minor.\nI’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate pa th of the federal funds rate,\nas usual, are conditional on partic ipants’ individual projectio ns of the most likely outcomes for\neconomic growth, employment and i nflation, and other factors. However, the actual path of the\nfederal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as infor med by incoming data. Stronger\ngrowth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the\nneutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expecte d, making it appropriate to raise\nthe federal funds rate more quick ly as well. Conversely, if th e economy were to disappoint, the\nfederal funds rate would likely rise more slowly.\nThe Committee will continue i ts policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury\nsecurities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities. As\nhighlighted in our policy statemen t, we anticipate continuing t his policy “until normalization of\nthe level of the federal funds rate is well under way.” Mainta ining our sizable holdings of\nlonger-term securities should help maintain accommodative finan cial conditions and should\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nreduce the risk that the federa l funds rate might return to the effective lower bound in the event\nof future adverse shocks.\nFinally, in conjunction with our pol icy statement, we also rele ased an implementation\nnote that provides details on the tools that we are using to ra ise the federal funds rate into the\nnew target range. Specifically, the Board of Gov ernors raised the interest rate paid on required\nand excess reserves to ½ percent , and the FOMC authorized overn ight reverse repurchase\noperations at an offering rate of ¼ percent. Both of these cha nges will be effective tomorrow.\nTo ensure sufficient monetary c ontrol at the onset of the norma lization process, we have, for the\ntime being, suspended the aggreg ate cap on overnight reverse re purchase transactions that has\nbeen in place during the test ing phase of this facility. Recal l that the Committ ee intends to phase\nout this facility when it is no l onger needed to help control t he federal funds rate. The Board of\nGovernors also approved a ¼ percen tage point increase in the di scount rate for primary credit to\n1 percent.\nBased on the extensive testing of our policy tools in recent ye ars, the Committee is\nconfident that the normalization process will proceed smoothly. Nonetheless, as part of prudent\ncontingency planning, we will be monitoring financial market de velopments closely in the\ncoming days and are prepared to make adjustments to our tools i f that proves necessary to\nmaintain appropriate control over money market rates.\nThank you. I will be happy to take your questions. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsi nger with the Associated Press. I guess the word\nis “finally.” The—we have a sked you for so long, “Why were you delaying? Why were you\ndelaying?” So, I’ll ask, given de velopments around the world t hat still—there is still weakness,\nand the inflation is still nowhere near your target. What made you say “Do it now”? Some have\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nsaid it was because you feared a lack of credibility if you did n’t move. Did that play a role in\nyour decision?\nCHAIR YELLEN. We decided to move a t this time because we feel the conditions that\nwe set out for a move—namely, furth er improvement in the labor market and reasonable\nconfidence that inflation woul d move back to 2 percent over the medium term—we felt that\nthese conditions had been satis fied. We have been concerned, a s you know, about the risks from\nthe global economy, and those risk s persist, but the U.S. econo my has shown considerable\nstrength. Domestic spending that accounts for 85 percent of ag gregate spending in the U.S.\neconomy has continued to hold up. It’s grown at a solid pace. And while there is a drag from\nnet exports, from relatively wea k growth abroad, and the apprec iation of the dollar, overall, we\ndecided today that the risks t o the outlook for the labor marke t and the economy are balanced.\nAnd we recognize that monetary po licy operates with lags. We w ould like to be able to\nmove in a prudent and, as we’ve em phasized, gradual manner. It ’s been a long time since the\nFederal Reserve has raised inter est rates, and I think it’s pru dent to be able to watch what the\nimpact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion\nenables us to do this.\nAgain, I think it’s important not to overblow the significance of this first move. It’s only\n25 basis points. It—monetary policy remains accommodative. We have indicated that we will\nbe watching what happens very c arefully in the economy in terms of our actual and forecast—\nour projected conditions relative to our employment and inflati on goals and will adjust policy\nover time as seems appropriate t o achieve those goals. Our exp ectation, as I’ve indicated, is that\npolicy adjustments will be gradual over time, but, of course, t hey will be informed by the\noutlook, which in turn will ev olve with incoming data.\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Madam Chair , thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Under the old\nregime, before you were raising r ates, it was easy to understan d within your mandate what you\nwanted to do. You wanted the unempl oyment rate to fall, you wa nted inflation to rise, and it was\neasy for the public to judge the success or failure of your pol icy. Could you explain under the\nnew regime what you’re looking for? Do you want the unemployme nt rate to stop falling? Do\nyou want it to rise? And what i s it you hope for from inflatio n, which I think is a little more\nunderstandable, or is “neutral ” itself now a policy goal?\nCHAIR YELLEN. “Neutral” is not a policy goal. It is an assess ment. It’s a benchmark\nthat I think is usual—is usefu l for assessing the stance of pol icy. Neutral is essentially a stance\nof policy, a level of short-term r ates, which, if the economy w ere operating near its potential—\nand we’re reasonably not quite a t that, but reasonably close to it—it would be a level that would\nmaintain or sustain those condi tions. So, at this point, polic y we judge to be accommodative.\nThe Committee forecasts that the unemployment rate will continu e to decline, and I think that’s\nimportant and appropriate for tw o reasons. First of all, as I’ ve indicated, I continue to judge that\nthere remains slack in the econom y, margins of slack that are n ot reflected in the standard\nunemployment rate, and, in partic ular, I’ve pointed to the depr essed level of labor force\nparticipation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of pa rt-time employment. So a\nfurther decline in the unemploy ment rate and strengthening of l abor market conditions will help\nto erode those margins of slac k. But also we want to see infla tion move up back to our 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term , and so seeing above-trend growt h and continuing tightness—\ngreater tightness in labor and pr oduct markets—I think that wil l help us achieve our objective as\nwell with respect to inflation.\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Just to follo w up, how does raising rates help get you to either of\nthose goals?\nCHAIR YELLEN. We have kept rates at an extremely low level and had a high balance\nsheet for a very long time. We ha ve considered the risks to th e outlook and worried about the\nfact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to re spond to negative shocks than to\npositive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy. Th at is a factor that has induced us to\nhold rates at zero for this long. B ut we recognize that policy is accommodative, and if we do not\nbegin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy\nwould end up overshooting both our employment and inflation obj ectives. What I—we would\nlike to avoid is a situation whe re we have waited so long that we’re forced to tighten policy\nabruptly, which risks aborting w hat I would like to see as a ve ry long-running and sustainable\nexpansion. So to keep the econom y moving along the growth path it’s on with improving and\nsolid conditions in labor marke ts, we would like to avoid a sit uation where we have left so much\naccommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these obje ctives and then have to tighten\nabruptly and risk damaging—damaging that performance.\nJON HILSENRATH. Chair Yelle n, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . In the\nsentence in your statement about g radual increases, in that sec tion, the Committee says that it\n“will carefully monitor” progress—actual and expected progress on inflation. That’s going to\nread like some kind of code to a l ot of people on Wall Street. Can you describe—what do you\nmean when you say “carefully mon itor”? And, speci fically, with regard to what you do next, do\nyou need to see inflation actuall y rise at this point in order to raise interest rates again?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we recogni ze that inflati on is well below our 2 percent goal.\nThe entire Committee is comm itted to achieving our 2 percent in flation objective over the\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nmedium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’ t persist at levels above our\n2 percent objective. The Comm ittee is equally committed—this i s a symmetric goal—and the\nCommittee is equally committed t o not allowing inflation to per sist below our 2 percent\nobjective.\nNow, I’ve tried to explain—and many of my colleagues have as we ll—why we have\nreasonable confidence that inf lation will move up over time, an d the Committee declared it had\nreasonable confidence. Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and w e really need to monitor over time\nactual inflation performance to m ake sure that it is conforming , it is evolving, in the manner that\nwe expect. So it doesn’t mean t hat we need to see inflation re ach 2 percent before moving again,\nbut we have expectations for how inflation will behave. And we re we to find that the underlying\ntheory is not bearing out, tha t it is not behaving in the manne r that we expect, and that it doesn’t\nlook like the shortfall is tra nsitory and disappearing with tig hter labor markets, that would\ncertainly give us pause.\nAnd we have indicated that we’ re reasonably close—not quite the re, but reasonably\nclose—to achieving our maximum em ployment objective, but we hav e a significant shortfall on\ninflation. And so we’re calling a ttention to the importance of verifying our—that things evolve\nin line with our forecasts.\nJON HILSENRATH. Just to fo llow up, do you need to see it rise? Not necessarily get to\nthe 2 percent goal, but in orde r to move again, do you want to see inflation measures actually\nmoving higher?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’m not going to gi ve you a simple formula for w hat we need to see\non the inflation front in order t o raise rates again. We’ll al so be looking at the path of\nemployment as well as the pat h for inflation. But if incoming data were—led us to call into\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nquestion the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds\nof evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause. Bu t I don’t want to say there’s a\nsimple benchmark. We—you know, the C ommittee expects inflation —over the next year, the\nmedian expectation is for in flation to be running about 1.6 per cent, and—both core and headline.\nSo we do expect it to be moving up, but we don’t expect it to r each 2 percent.\nCRAIG TORRES. Hi, Madam Chair, C raig Torres from Bloomberg. I ’d like to follow\nJon’s question. The way the Com mittee describes inflation—well , there’s this “transitory”\nlanguage. I’d like to point out tha t oil prices today are at 3 6, and on June 15, they were $60. So,\nthis “transitory,” which first appeared in the statement in Dec ember, I believe, is lasting a long,\nlong time, maybe longer than ma ny people’s definition of “trans itory,” and it could go on. And,\nsecond, I really wonder if the Committee knows how quickly wage increases or labor market\ntightness transfers into higher prices, and that too is also a forecast. So, my question: What will\nyou be willing to do if you don’t see progress toward 2 percent inflation? We missed the target\nfor three years, and, you know, w hat would you be willing to do ? And, second, would you allow\ninflation to bounce around betw een 2 and 3 percent the way you’ ve allowed it to move under\n2 percent over the past several years? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. First, let me say w ith respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by\nthe further downward movement in oil prices, but we do not need to see oil prices rebound to\nhigher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out. So all they need to do is stabilize.\nI believe there is some limit below which oil prices are unlike ly to rise. If we look—to fall. If\nwe look at market expectations, mar ket expectations are for sta bilization and then some gradual\nupward movement. So I certainly g rant that we’ve had a series of shocks pushing them down,\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nbut we’re not looking for them t o revert back to the—to higher levels that they were at merely to\nstabilize.\nWe—I would point out, you asked me , would we tolerate overshoot s. For a number of\nyears between 2004 and 2008, we had a s eries of increases in oi l prices that for a series of years\nraised inflation above—again, we didn’t have a 2 percent object ive then, but—raised it above\n2 percent, and we judged those incr eases to be transitory as we ll and looked through them. We\ndo monitor inflation expectations very carefully. If we saw in a meaningful way that inflation\nexpectations were either movi ng up in a way that made it—them s eem unanchored or down, that\nwould be of concern. And we have called attention to some slig ht downward movements in\nsurvey measures. We are watchi ng that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are\nreasonably well anchored. So, yes , we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that we thought would\ndisappear over the medium term j ust as we did overshoots of inf lation that we also judged to be\ntransitory. But we do need to mon itor inflation very carefully because if energy prices and the\ndollar were to stabilize, impor t prices, our expectation is tha t both headline and core inflation\nwould move up. And if we failed t o see that occurring in the m anner that we expect, of course\nwe need to take further action to reconsider the outlook and to put in place appropriate policy.\nCRAIG TORRES. What woul d that action look like?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, you know, if the economy were disappointin g, we—you know,\nour actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflatio n, we would als o take employment into account.\nSo I can’t give you a simple an swer, but we would pursue a more accommodative policy because\nwe do—certainly are committed to achieving 2 percent over the m edium term.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . Bill Dudley has\ntalked about the need for the F ed to adjust policy based on the responsiveness of financial\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nmarkets as you begin to increase rates. You didn’t talk about that today. Is it a point that you\nagree with? And, if so, what is it that you’re looking for? H ow will you judge whether financial\nmarkets are accepting and transmitting these changes?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, there are num ber of different channels thr ough which monetary\npolicy is transmitted to spending decisions. The behavior of l onger-term—longer-term interest\nrates, short-term interest rate s matter. The value of asset pr ices and the exchange rate, also—\nthese are transmission channels. We wouldn’t be focused on sho rt-term financial volatility, but\nwere there unanticipat ed changes in financi al conditions that w ere persistent and we judged to\naffect the outlook, we would of cour se have to take those into account. So we will watch\nfinancial developments, but what we’re looking at here is the l onger-term economic outlook:\nAre we seeing persistent changes in financial market conditions that would have a bearing, a\nsignificant bearing, on the outlook that we would need to take account in formulating appropriate\npolicy? Yes, we would, but it’s not short-term volatility in m arkets.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. In part, what I was attempting to say is, if you didn’t see\nchanges, you would be concerned a nd have to move more, quickly. Are you concerned that if\nmarkets don’t tighten suffici ently you may need to do more?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, look, you know, w e—this is not an unantici pated policy move,\nand we have been trying to expl ain what our policy strategy is. So it’s not as though I’m\nexpecting to see a marked, immed iate reaction in financial mark ets. Expectations about Fed\npolicy have been built into the str ucture of financial market p rices, but we obviously will track\ncarefully the behavior of both s hort- and longer-term interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices,\nand if they move in persistent a nd significant ways that are ou t of line with the expectations that\nwe have, then of course we will take those into account.\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nREBECCA JARVIS. Thank you. Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News. Histori cally, most\neconomic expansions fade after this long. How confident are yo u that our economy won’t slip\nback into recession in the near term?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start b y saying that I feel confident about the fundamentals\ndriving the U.S. economy, the health of U.S. households, and do mestic spending. There are\npressures on some sectors of the economy, particularly manufact uring and the energy sector,\nreflecting global developments and developments in commodity ma rkets and energy markets, but\nthe underlying health of the U.S . economy I consider to be quit e sound. I think it’ s a myth that\nexpansions die of old age. I do not think that they die of old age. So the fact that this has been\nquite a long expansion doesn’t l ead me to believe that it’s one that has—its days are numbered.\nBut the economy does get hit by shocks, and there are both posi tive shocks and negative shocks.\nAnd so there is a significan t odd, you know, probability in any year that the economy will suffer\nsome shock that we don’t know about that will put it into reces sion. And so I’m not sure exactly\nhow high that probability is i n any year, but maybe at least on the order of 10 percent. So, yes,\nthere is some probability tha t that could happen, and of course we’d appropriately respond, but it\nisn’t something that is fated to happen because we’ve had a lon g expansion, and I don’t see\nanything in the underlying stren gth of the economy that would l ead me to be concerned about\nthat outcome.\nREBECCA JARVIS. In the event of an outcome like that, in the m ost negative of\nscenarios, are there other polic y measures outside of interest rates, outside of traditional\nquantitative easing, that you ins ide of the Fed have discussed and contemplated for another\nenvironment like something whic h we saw throughout the Great Re cession? Have you talked\nabout anything that would be mor e direct to the economy?\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, during the years in which we were—you know , the economy\nwas recovering from the Great R ecession and we put further poli cy and measures in place, we\nstudied our policy op tions quite carefully. As you know, commu nications policy to affect market\nexpectations about the path of int erest rates played an importa nt role. That’s something we did\nin conjunction with asset purchases . Obviously, we lowered our overnight interest rate\neffectively to zero. Now, we have seen some foreign central ba nks, Europe—the ECB and\nothers—that have taken their ove rnight rate int o negative terri tory, and that’s something that—I\ndon’t contemplate that we will need to do this, but it is somet hing that we could study. Of\ncourse, we have balance sheet po licies, and there might be a ra nge of direct polic ies that we\ncould use as well. But this is something that we have thought about, our range of options.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . Could I ask\nabout the balance sheet policy you ’re adopting today? You’ve s aid that you want to keep a large\nbalance sheet until normaliza tion is “well under way.” Could y ou explain first of all why you\nanticipate that being appropriate? What does “well under way” mean in terms of normalization?\nAnd, longer term, what are your view s on the idea that the Fed might need to have a larger\nbalance sheet tha n historically over t he longer term?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, in our normali zation principles, which are in effect, the\nCommittee stated that we eventua lly want to operate with a much smaller balance sheet of—than\nwe have at present. The—we woul d reduce the size of the balanc e sheet to essentially whatever\nsize we needed to manage moneta ry policy effective—in an effect ive and efficient way. Now, a\nlot has changed since pre–financia l crisis in term s of the fina ncial system, and we are studying—\nwe are engaging in a project at th is time to consider what our long-run operating framework\nshould look like. So I can’t te ll you exactly what size of bal ance sheet we will determine is the\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nbest to operate in an efficient and effective manner. It might be somewhat larger than the very\ntiny quantity of reserves that we had in pre-crisis. We have n ot determined that. We have also\nsaid that we will—we expect to reduce the size of our balance s heet over time by cease—\ndiminishing or ceasing entir ely reinvestments. And, beyond tha t, we haven’t given additional\nguidance other than to say tha t the timing of reductions in rei nvestment will depend on economic\nand financial conditions. And I s uppose the additional guidanc e we’re giving today, when we\nsay “well under way,” we want to s ee—as I mentioned, there are number of considerations, and\nthe Committee has made no further decisions about this, but as we’ve discussed, the factors that\nwill be relevant to the decision—on e factor that we’ve talked a bout is the desirability of having\nsome scope to respond to an adve rse shock to the economy by low ering the federal funds rate.\nAnd so it would be nice to have a buffer in terms of having rai sed the federal funds rate to a\ncertain extent to give us some meaningful scope to respond. No w, I don’t have in mind any\nparticular level of the feder al funds rate. It would depend on the entire economic outlook, how\nrobust the economy is. But that is an important consideration for the Committee, and it means\nthat this is not something that we expect to be turning to, to cease reinvestment very quickly.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes at Fox Business, ma’am. On financi al market\nconditions, is there a problem developing in the high-yield sec tor of the bond market, the junk\nbond sector? As you know, last week a mutual fund, Third Avenu e Management, halted\nredemptions so that it wouldn’t have to—because of a sharp sell off in these kinds of bonds. Are\nyou concerned at all, and did you di scuss in the meeting, any r isk to the financial system, a\nsystemic risk, because of the conditions in the junk bond marke t? And, you know, individual\ninvestors and institutions hol d trillions of dollars of these b onds, which were sold heavily\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nbecause of low rates, and did the Fed’s low interest rate polic y help lay—sow the seeds for this\ndevelopment? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, risk spread s in the high-yield bond market have been widening\nsince last year, partly refl ecting falling oil prices—only part ly, but partly—and redemptions in\nhigh-yield bond funds have been inc reasing in recent months. B ut Third Avenue Focused Credit\nFund was a rather unusual open- end mutual fund. It had very co ncentrated positions in\nespecially risky and illiqui d bonds, and it had been facing ver y significant redemption pressures.\nMy understanding is that the SEC i s in touch with Third Avenue. And, as you probably know,\nthe SEC has proposed some reforms to address what’s a structura l problem of liquidity mismatch\nin open-end mutual funds.\nSo we continue to believe that f inancial conditions are support ive of economic growth.\nWe will be—we have been and will c ontinue to track developments in financial markets very\ncarefully. I would sa y that I think we have a far more resilie nt financial system now than we had\nprior to the financial crisis and highly capital[ized] banks th at are well situated to support\ncorporate lending.\nI’d also point out that many corpor ations during these years ha ve reduced their interest\npayments and extended their de bt profiles, and I think that sho uld help to mitigate spillovers, but\nwe will be evaluati ng this carefully.\nYLAN MUI. Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post . You said earlier that expansions don’t\ndie of old age, but I think the ot her half of that is that it’s often central banks that kill them off\ninstead. So I’m wondering how worried you are about the possib ility that the Fed will have to\nturn around after hiking rates. O ther central banks that have tried to raise rates have had to do\njust that. And how damaging you think t hat might be to the Fed ’s credibility?\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, whe n you say that central banks often kill t hem, I think the usual\nreason that that has been true wh en that has been true is that central banks have begun too late to\ntighten policy, and they’ve allowe d inflation to get out of con trol. And at that point, they have\nhad to tighten policy very abrupt ly and very substantially, and it’s caused a downturn, and the\ndownturn has served to lower inflation. So, if you don’t mind my flipping the question on you, I\nwould point out that it is because we don’t want to cause a rec ession through that type of\ndynamic at some future date that it is prudent to begin early a nd gradually.\nNow, it is true that some centr al banks have raised rates and l ater turned around. Not in\nevery case has that reflected a policy mistake. Economies are subject to shocks. Sometimes\nwhen they have raised rates, it hasn’t been the wrong thing to do, but conditions have changed in\na way that they have had to rev erse policy to respond to shocks .\nI’m not denying that there are situations where central banks h ave moved too early. We\nhave considered the risk of that . We have weighed that risk ca refully in making today’s\ndecision. I don’t believe w e’ll have to do it. But, look, you know, as I’ve—as the Committee\nhas said, we’re watching economic developments closely, and we will adjust policy in whatever\nway is necessary to support the attainment of our objectives.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times . You said it’s\nimportant not to overblow the significance to this first move, but, as you know, there’s been a lot\nof attention paid to it. Ca n you explain to average Americans what if anything might be different\nin the next few weeks or few mont hs for them because of this in terest rate hike?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think the first —the first thing that Americ ans should realize is\nthat the Fed’s decision today ref lects our confidence in the U. S. economy, that we believe we\nhave seen substantial improveme nt in labor market conditions, a nd while things may be uneven\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nacross regions of the country a nd different industrial sectors, we see an economy that is on a path\nof sustainable improvement. S o, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their\nfinancial prospects going forw ard, I hope they will take this d ecision as one that signals the\nFOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen a nd job market prospects will be\ngood.\nIt is a very small move. It wil l be reflected in some changes in borrowing rates. Longer-\nterm interest rates—loans that are linked to longer-term intere st rates are unlikely to move—to\nmove very much. Some—for example , some corporate loans are lin ked to the prime rate, which\nis likely to move up with the fe d funds rate, and those interes t rates will adjust. There are some\nconsumer borrowing rates, I think c redit card rates, that are l inked to short-term rates that might\nmove up slightly. But, remember, w e have very low rates, and w e have made a very small move.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Madam Chair, John Heltman with American Banker. How\nconcerned are you with interest rate risk in banks now that you ’ve obviously ended the zero-rate\nera and began the 0.25 percent–rate era? Is that a factor in d ecisions going forward? Is it\nsomething that you’re concerned about?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Interest rate ris k at banks is something that we have been monitoring\nvery carefully for quite a long time. The community banks and smaller banking organizations\nthat we work with—part of our supe rvision has been ensuring tha t they manage appropriately for\ninterest rate risk. And the lar ger banking organizations that are subject to the stress tests and\ncapital planning—the scenarios t hat we have presented in each o f the last three years look at their\nability to withstand what would be much sharper increases in in terest rates than we’re\nenvisioning would happen. But we want to make sure that if the re were sharper increases—\nunlike our expectati ons—that they would be well positioned to h andle it. And we have\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nconcluded that—that their capital positions are sufficient for them to weather it. So this has been\nvery much on our minds.\nLINDSAY DUNSMUIR. Hi, Lindsa y Dunsmuir with Reuters. You keep saying that the\nthings holding back inflation are t ransitory, and yet every day there seems to be new impulses\nfrom outside that look that they could drive prices lower. I g uess my question is, if in a year’s\ntime inflation remains where i t is today, would you see that as a defeat for your theory? And is\nthat part of the reason why the la nguage has been upgraded in t he statement to say that you want\nto see actual progress towa rds your 2 percent target?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we have sai d that we will carefully monito r both actual and\nexpected progress. You know, I t hink that standard Fed policy has been to look through shocks\nthat are transitory. Occasionall y, there are sequences of tran sitory shocks. We have had some\nfurther declines in energy pr ices, and, you know, as I said pre viously, I do expect there is a\nbottom to that. I expect we w ill be seeing it. If we—if we an alyze inflation data and conclude\nthat, clearly, transitory inf luences are holding down inflation , I do not want to say that we would\nrespond to that. But if we concl uded that there were structura l factors or that there were a\nproblem with our theory or some gl obal deflationary force that were simply persistently holding\ndown inflation in a way that was not transitory —and I don’t wan t to attach any simplistic\nmeaning to what we would need to s ee to conclude that in the in flation data, but if we concluded\nthat, we certainly would take ac tion to make sure we adjusted p olicy so that we attain our\n2 percent objective. But we w ould need to feel that what we we re seeing in the data suggested a\nsustained departure from our 2 per cent objective that we really needed to address.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from Mark etWatch. There’s been a lot of talk today and a lot\nof discussion about the downside risks facing the economy from, you know, the global\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nenvironment, but you say in your state ment that the risks are n early balanced. So should—could\nyou talk more about the upside ri sks that you see t o the econom y? And, just briefly, the—some\nFed officials have been emphasizi ng lately the median CPIs from Dallas and Cleveland. How\nmuch weight do you put on those measures?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, starting wit h the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics\nthat bear on the inflation outl ook, and the median CPI has been somewhat more stable and\nrunning closer to 2 percent than t he PCE, but there is a system atic gap between these two\nmeasures, and our objective is 2 per cent on the PCE price index , and so there’s no simple\ntranslation. We do have a PCE i nflation objective. Sorry, let ’s see, the other—the upside risks.\nSo I—there are upside risks to the economy, and I think, you kn ow, we tend to focus on the\ndownside risk. It’s right to do so. We want to be careful abo ut downside risks. But consumers\nare in much healthier financial condition. Their income prospe cts have improved. We see them\nbuying a lot of cars. Housing has been recovering very slowly, but the demographics would\npoint to considerable upside for residential investment. My ma inline forecast is for gradual\nrecovery, but there is upside r isk there. We have seen that th e decline in drilling has been\ndepressing investment spending, but there’s upside risk too. T he global economy—we tend to\nfocus—there are many countries t hat are undergoing very difficu lt adjustments or slowing\ngrowth, especially with declini ng commodity prices. But even r ecently, we’ve seen growth in\nemerging markets strengthe n. And—so it is not only downside ri sks, but, you know, we do pay\nattention to downside risks. But the Committee said they regar d the risks overall as balanced.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Chair Yellen, Steve Beckner of MNI. You have o ften said that the\nFed is going to be data depende nt, but you’ve also said in the past that you want to avoid being\nmechanical. Now, if the data see m to warrant rate hikes at suc cessive meetings, how will you\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\navoid the perception—a market pe rception—that you ’re falling in to a pattern or becoming\nmechanical?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we will tr y to avoid that. I do want to e mphasize that while we\nhave said “gradual,” gradual doe s not mean mechanical, evenly t imed, equally sized interest rate\nchanges. So that is not what the Committee means by it. My gu ess is that the economy will\nprogress in a manner that is not sufficiently even that we will decide to make evenly spaced\nhikes. I recognize we want to do w hat’s appropriate, and I rec ognize that’s a danger. But I do\nwant to assure you that we will be data dependent. As the outl ook evolves, w e’ll respond\nappropriately. I strongly doubt that it will mean equally spac ed hikes, and it certainly is not the\nintention of the Committee to fo llow any mechanical formula of that type.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greel ey, Bloomberg. You just mention ed that it may\nbe possible that structural f actors are holding down inflation as well, and the dynamic that’s\nhappening in top-line inflation i s happening in core as well. In September, the median projection\nwas revised down. Again today, t he median projection was revis ed down, and this is happening\nat other central banks as well . Additionally, markets see much lower inflation in the future than\ncentral bank models do. Within the Fed, how are you adapting y our models to look at what is\nnow—seems to be a new reality, a nd what are you learning as you do that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, so the reas on—the main reason that we revi sed down our\nprojection ever so slightly—it’s hardly revised f or core inflat ion—is because we have seen\nfurther appreciation of the dolla r that’s holding down import p rices that spills over into core\ninflation. I mean, my own estim ation is that core inflation wi ll pick up. There are various\nidiosyncratic factors that affect core inflation—for example, n onmarket price increases, which\nare a little bit hard to underst and, have been running at a slo w pace. There were factors that have\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nbeen affecting inflation in medi cal care prices that may change over time. So there is some\nidiosyncratic factors. But I pe rsonally don’t think we’re in a world where inflation is being\ndetermined in a different way t han it has historically. I see import prices and energy prices as\nholding down headline but also core, and I do believe it will p ick up. But as we’ve said, if that\ntheory is wrong and we do not see in flation is unfolding in the way the Committee expects, we\nwill make adjustments over time in policy.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. You have a background as an academic. Are yo u looking into\nthese models to see whether they need to be adapted?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I mean, we have m any people who are studying inf lation models.\nI’ve, you know, tried to—let me express some humility about the m. I do not think that they’re\nperfect. Monetary policy is based on economic forecasts. Ther e are theories of how the\neconomy works that govern many a spects of economic forecasting. Whether it’s consumer\nspending or residential invest ment or inflation, the underlying theories are not perfect, and they\nare subject to uncertainty. And thi s is true in all aspects of forecasting, which is why we change\nour forecasts and our models. We throw out models that are per sistently not working. We’re\nalways trying to develop better models. I’m not aware, I will say, of a different model of\ninflation that would be superior to the one that we employ. Bu t we have to verify that inflation is\nmoving in the manner that we e xpect, and if it’s not, we need t o adjust policy accordingly.\nJEREMY TORDJMAN. Hello, Jeremy T ordjman with Agence France-Pre sse, AFP. Are\nyou concerned about the negative im pact that your decision coul d have on the emerging\nmarkets? Do you fear it could trigge r some financial turbulenc es abroad that could eventually hit\nthe U.S.?\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we are consta ntly monitoring foreign economic developments,\nincluding those in emerging mar kets. We understand that in the global economy, with integrated\nproduct and capital markets, that our fates are very much linke d, and that the performance of the\nU.S. economy has important spillo vers onto emerging markets and vice versa. We have been\ntrying very carefully—we’ve made a commitment to emerging marke t policymakers that we\nwould do our best to communicate as clearly as we could about o ur policy intentions to avoid\nspillovers that might result from abrupt or unanticipated polic y moves. I think this move has\nbeen expected and well communicat ed—at least, I hope that it ha s. So I don’t think it’s a\nsurprise. This action takes plac e in the context of a U.S. eco nomy that is doing well and is a\nsource of strength to the emer ging markets and other economies around the globe. And so—that\nis, there can be negative spillovers through capital flows, but remember, there are also positive\nspillovers from a strong U.S. economy. My general view is that many emerging markets are in a\nstronger position than they would have been in the 1990s—for ex ample, that they have stronger\nmacroeconomic policies. They have taken steps to strengthen th eir financial systems and are\nbetter positioned to deal with thi s. On the other hand, there are vulnerabilities there, and there\nare countries that have bee n badly affected by declining commod ity prices, so we will monitor\nthis very carefully. But we have taken care to avoid unnecessa ry negative spillovers.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER . Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Wage\ngrowth is not quite whe re you would like it to be—\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’m sorry, what? NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Wage gr owth is not quite where you woul d like it to\nbe. How much is that going t o play into your thinking next yea r as you’re trying to decide\nwhether to raise interest rates more and when?\n\nDecember 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So my expectation i s that in a strengthening lab or market that we\nwould see faster wage growth, and I believe there is, with the 2 percent inflati on objective, space\nfor wage growth to be higher th an it’s been. We may be seeing some incipient signs of faster\nwage growth. We’ve seen a pic kup in measures of hourly compens ation and some slight firming\nin recent months in average hour ly earnings. I hesitate to say that this is a firm trend. We’ve\nbeen disappointed in the past. Wag e growth is not—there are ma ny factors that affect it—it’s\nnot definitive in any sense i n determining our policy, but it d oes have a bearing on the inflation\noutlook. It also has a beari ng on assessing how much slack the re is in the labor market, and I\nthink a number of my colleagues looking at the slow pace of wag e growth have—you’ve seen\nthat their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate have come down. And I think\nthat is one of the factors that has prompted those adjustments. So, you know, it does affect views\nabout just how much slack there i s in the labor market and the inflation outlook."
