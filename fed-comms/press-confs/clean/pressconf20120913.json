  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Good afternoon. Earlier t oday the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) approved new measures to support the recovery and employment growth .\nI’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few moments , but I’ll first describe the economic\nconditions that motivated the Committee’s decision to take additional action s.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy under a dual mandate from\nCongress to promote maximum employment and price stability. The United States has enjoyed\nbroad price stability since the mid -1990s and continues to do so today. T he empl oyment\nsituation , however, remains a grave concern. While the economy appears to be on a path of\nmoderate recovery, it isn’t growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the\nunemployment rate. F ewer than half of the 8 million jobs lost in th e recession have been\nrestored . And, at 8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of\nthe year and is well above normal levels.\nThe weak job market should concern every American. High unemployment imposes\nhardship on millions of people, and it entails a tremendous waste of human skills and talents .\nFive million Americans have been unemployed for more than six months, and millions more\nhave left the labor force —many of them doubtl ess because they have given up on finding\nsuitable work. As the skills of the long -term unemployed atrophy and as their connections to the\nlabor market wither, they may find it increasingly difficult to get good jobs, to their and their families’ cost, of course, but also to the detriment of our nation’s productive potential.\nTo help bolster the recovery and promote price stability, the FOMC has provided\nunprecedented levels of policy accommodation in recent years. With our main policy interest\n\nmonetary policy —balance sheet actions and forward guidance regarding how long we anticipate\nmaintaining ex ception al levels of policy accommodation. While providing this support, we have\nbeen prudent, carefully weighing the potential benefits and costs of each new policy action, and recognizing that monetary policy, particularly in the current circumstances, cannot cure all economic ills.\nThe FOMC has taken several actio ns this year. In January, it extended its forward\nguidance, stating that it anticipate d that the federal funds rate will remain near current levels until\nlate 2014. In June, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year the previously\nestablished program to extend the average maturity of the securities it holds by buying longer -\nterm securities and selling an equivalent amount of shorter -term securities. However, incoming\ndata confirm that the modest pace of growth continues to be inadequa te to generate much\nprogress on unemployment. W ith inflation anticipated to run at or below our 2 percent objective,\nthe Committee has become convinced that further policy accommodation is warranted to\nstrengthen the recovery and support the gains we have begun to see in housing and other sectors.\nAccordingly , the FOMC decided today on new actions , electing to expand its purchase s\nof securities and extend its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate. Specifically, the\nCommittee decided to purchas e additional agency mortgage -backed securities , or MBS , at a pace\nof $40 billion per month. The new MBS purchases —combined with the existing maturity\nextension program and the continued reinvestment of principal payments f rom agency debt and\nagency MBS already on our balance sheet —will result in an increase in our holdings of longer -\nterm securities of about $85 billion each month for the remainder of the year . The program of\nMBS purchases should increase the downward pressure on long -term interest rates more\n\nhousing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing.\nThe Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for\nthe recovery. First, the Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and\nfinancial developments in c oming months , and if we do not see substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market , we will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional\nasset purchases, and employ our policy tools as appropriate until we do. We will be looking for\nthe sort of broad -based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained\nimprovement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment. Of course , in\ndetermining the size, pace, and composition of any additional asset purchases, we will, as always, take appropriate account of the inflation outlook and of their efficacy and costs.\nAdditionally, the Committee emphasized that it expects a highly accommodative stance\nof monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. This should provide greater assurance to households and businesses that policy\naccommodation will remain even as the economy picks up. In particular, the Committee today\nkept the target range f or the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and stated that it anticipates that\nexceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid -\n2015.\nIn conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants —the 7 Board members and\n12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy\nassessments for the years 2012 through 2015 and over t he longer run. Committee participants’\nprojections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of t his year have a central tendency\nof 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, levels that\n\nParticipants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent for this\nyear and 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent for 2015.\nWhile the economy appears to be advancing at a mode rate pace, with some\nimprove ments appearing in housing and elsewhere, FOMC participants see an economic outlook\nthat remains uncertain. The economy continues to face economic headwinds, including the\nsituation in Europe; tight credit for some borrowers; and fiscal contraction at the federal, state ,\nand local levels. In addition, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant\ndownside risks.\nBefore I take your questions , I’d like to briefly address three concerns that have been\nraised about the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy. The first is the notion that\nthe Federal Reserve’s securit ies purchases are akin to fiscal spending. The second is that a\npolicy of very low rates hurts savers. The third is that the Federal Reserve’s policies risk\ninflation down the road.\nOn the first concern, I want to emphas ize that the Fed’s purchases of longer -term\nsecurities are not comparable to government spending. T he Federal Reserve buys financial\nassets, not goods and services. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve will normalize its balance sheet\nby selling these financial assets back into the market or by allowing them to mature. In the\ninterim, the Federal Reserve’s earnings fro m its holdings of securities are remitted to the\nTreasury. In fact, the odds are strong that the Fed’s asset purchase programs , both through their\nnet interest earnings and by strengthening the overall economy, will help reduce rather than increase the federal defic it and debt.\n\nbearing assets , such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns. But low interest\nrates also support the value of many other assets that Americans own, such as homes and\nbusinesses large and small. Indeed, in general, healthy investment returns cannot be sustained in\na weak economy , and , of course , it is difficult to save for retirement or other goals without the\nincome from a job. Thus, while low interest rates do impose some costs, Americans will ultimately benefit most from the healthy and growing economy that low interest rates help promote.\nAnd f inally, on inflation: Inflation has varied in recent years with swings in global foo d\nand fuel prices caused by a range of factors, such as drought and geopolitical tensions. However,\noverall inflation has averaged very close to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent per year for quite a\nfew years now, and a variety of measures show that longer -term inflation expectations are quite\nstable. The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as\nwell as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emergin g threat to price stability.\nThank you. I’d be happy to respond to your questions.\nDARREN GERSH. H i, Mr. Chairman, it ’s Darren Gers h, Nightly Business Report . Your\nforecast doesn ’t get back to full employment for four years, so could these new bond purchases\ngo on for years? And can you give us a better idea of when you ’ll—if you have specifics in\nmind on when you ’ll know it ’s time to stop?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yes. We ’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong\nenough to prom ote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and\ndeclines in unemployment. I mean, that ’s—we ’re not going to be able to sustain purchases until\n\nrecovery , to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs and reduce the\nunemployment rate . So that ’s the criterion we ’re looking at.\nKRISTINA PETERSON. Kristina Peterson of Dow J ones. The statement indicated that\nthe highly acc ommodative stance would be maintained until after the recovery starts to\nstrengthen , but there aren ’t any specific economic conditions that are described . Could you\ndescribe what those would be ? Or is the Fed —the Fed seem s reluctant to have done that so far .\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, we ’ve been ta lking about our communications at the\nFOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public , you know, what our\npolicy reaction function, so to speak, is . And we haven’ t, to this point , come to a set of n umbers,\na set of data that we can put out . But what we ’re trying to convey here is that we ’re not going to\nbe premature in removing policy accommodation. E ven after the economy starts to recover more\nquickly, even after the unemployment rate begins to move down more decisively, we ’re not\ngoing to rush to begin to tighten policy . We ’re going to give it some time to make sure the\nrecovery is well established.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about that same line in the statement .\nDoes that mean that your tolerance for inflation will be higher in coming years , in the middle of\nthe recovery? And , if not, what good is that language there if it doesn’ t tell people that the\nreaction function relative to inflation has changed? Secondly, stock prices are up today, so are\noil prices and gold. Why aren ’t those part of the same reaction to the Fed ’s acts today?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , our policy approa ch doesn ’t involve intentionally\ntrying to raise inflation . That ’s not the objective . The idea is to make su re we provide enough\nsupport so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time . I mean,\n\nplace it was in January . We’ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment\nrate, and what we need to see is more progress . And that ’s what we will be looking at . In terms\nof the m id-2015 date, we think by that point that the economy will be recovering, we’ll be\nproviding the support it needs . But if you look at our projections, you’ ll see it doesn ’t involve\nany inflation , that we still believe that inflation is going to be close to our 2 percent target.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . All right, I just need to follow up. Does this —so you ’re saying it\ndoes not include greater tolerance for inflation , that you will— you would reverse course if\ninflation were to be above your target level, even given that statement?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked\nabout in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach . We bring inflation back to the\ntarget over time , but w e do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our\nobjectives, you know, from their targets .\nZACHARY GOLDFARB . Thank you, Mr. Chairman . Earlier this year, on two\noccasions, the Fed took policy action s, which you defend ed as extremel y important for the\neconomy , but, as you mentioned, there hasn’ t been any improvement in the labor markets since\nthe beginning of the year . Why should people believe this will make a difference? And the\nprojections seem to suggest it ’s approximately a 0. 4 reduction in unemployment . Is that the limit\nof what Fed policies can do going forward?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , our assessment —I talked about this at my remarks at\nJackson Hole —our assessment , and that of the research literature, is that the polic ies that we ’ve\nundertaken have had real benefits for the economy —that they have provided some support, that\nthey have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment . All tha t being said,\n\nproblems . We ’re looking for policymakers in other areas to do their part . We’ll do our part , and\nwe’ll try to make sure that unemployment moves in the right direction , but we can ’t solve this\nproblem by ourselves.\nZACHARY GOLDFARB . And do you think that 0.4 percent difference in the\nprojections is about what ’s possible?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, what happens is going to depend on where the\neconomy goe s—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy . The 0.4 percent\nyou’re referring to is the change in the forecast between the last projection and this one . But\nremember, people make projections assuming that policy is appropriate . So some of them may\nhave assumed these policies in their last projections , and not all are assuming these policies in\nthis projection. So tha t’s probably a little bit of an understatement of what we think we can get .\nBut in any case, again, I want to be clear that while I think we can make a meaningful and\nsignificant contribu tion to this problem —to reducing this problem, we can’ t solve it. We don’ t\nhave tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem.\nMIKE MCKEE . You’ve made an el oquent explanation ove r the past couple of weeks of\nthe Fed ’s ability to lower in terest rates . But what ’s missing for many economists is how the\ntransmission mechanism is going to work . Most people think this will have a minimal effect on\nrates . Can you give us an idea of how much you think it might push rates down, a nd why\nmoving r ates down a few basis points might change demand, which seems to be the problem in\nthe economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the ultimate effect is going to depen d, of course , on\nhow much we end up doing , and that , in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does .\n\neconomy evolves . I think that ’s the virtue of putting it this way , is that if the economy is weaker,\nwe’ll provide more support ; if the economy st rengthens on its own or other headwinds die down,\nthen it will require less support . So the amount of support we provide is going to depend on how\nthe economy evolves . We do think that these policies can bring interest rates down—not just\nTreasury rates , but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds\nand other types of important interest rates . It also affects stock prices . It affects other asset\nprices —home prices , for example. So looking at all the different channe ls of effect, we think it\ndoes have impact on the economy . It will have impact on the labor market , but, as again, the\nway I would describe it is a meaningful effect, a sign ificant effect , but not a panacea, not a\nsolution for the whole issue . We ’re just trying to get the economy moving in the right direction ,\nto make sure that we don ’t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we ’re making progress\ntoward s more acceptable l evels of unemployment.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, is this the\nlimit of what the Fed could do? You refer in your statement to other policy tools . If the\nunemployment situation doesn’ t improve , then what other measures do you have available?\nThank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, there ’s a var iety of possibilities , and we continue to\nlook at all different options . But the two primary types of tools , as I ’ve discussed , are balance\nsheet action s—and, of course, we can restructur e those, change those in various ways ; the other\ntype of tool is communication tools . And we could—we continue to work on how best to\ncommunicate with the public and how best to assure the public that the Fed will remain\naccommodative long enough to ensure recovery . So, working with our communications tools,\n\nprovide accommodation.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Pedro da Costa from Reuters . My question is —I want to go back\nto the tra nsmission mechanism because , speaking to people on the sideli nes of the Jackson Hole\nconference, that seemed to be the concern about the remarks that you made is that they could\nclearly see the effect on rates and they could see the effect on the stock market , but they couldn’ t\nsee how that had helped the economy . So I think there ’s a fear that , over time, this has been a\npolicy that ’s helping Wall Street but not doing that much for Main Street . So could you\ndescribe, in some detail , how does it really different —differ from trickle -down economics ,\nwhere you just pump money into the banks and hope that they lend?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well we are—this is a Main Street policy , because what\nwe’re about here is trying to get jobs going . We are trying to create more employment , we are\ntrying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that ’s the objective . Our tools involve —I\nmean , the to ols we have involve affecting financial asset prices , and that ’s—those are the tools\nof monetary policy . There are a number of different channels —mortgage rates, I mentioned\nother interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like , for example,\nthe prices of homes . To the extent that home prices begin to rise, consumers will feel wealthier,\nthey’ll feel more disposed to spend. If house prices are ris ing, people may be more willing to\nbuy homes because they think that they ’ll, you know, make a better return on that purchase . So\nhouse prices is one vehicle . Stock prices —many people own stocks directly or indirectly . The\nissue here is whether or not i mproving asset prices generally will make people more willing to\nspend. One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there ’s not\nenough people coming and demanding their products . And if people feel that their financial\n\nmore, they are more willing to go out and spend, and that ’s going to provide the demand that\nfirms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, the\nstatement says —we’ve come back to this a couple of times — “If the outlook for the labor market\ndoes not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage -\nbacked securities, … additional asset purchases , and employ … other policy tools .” Can you\ndefine and describe more specifically what “ improve substantially ” means? And what do you—\nwhat is the Committee referring to when it says “additional asset purchases ” and “ other …\ntools .”\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , again, we’ re looking for ongoing sustained\nimprove ment in the labor market . There’ s not a specific number we have in mind . But what\nwe’ve seen in the last six months isn ’t it. We’re looking for something that involves\nunemployment coming down in a sustained way, not necessarily a rapid way , because I don ’t\nknow if our tools are that strong, but we ’d like to see an economy which is strong enough that it\nwill support improving labor market conditions and unemployment that ’s declining gradually\nover time . That ’s essentially what we’ re looking for . In terms of the tools that we have, we have\nthe mortgage -backed security purchases , which we can continue or expand or change in any —\nyou know, in various ways . We could also purchase , of course , Treasuries ; we’ve retained that\ncapacity . And in terms of other policies , again, there are a number of possibilities , but the one I\nmentioned to Zach in particular is our communication policies, finding ways to better explain our\nrate policies that will engender more -accommodative financial conditions.\n\nannouncement today has created a good deal of confusion about how long you’ ll keep buying\nassets, judging from the questions in this room and outside of it . Why did you choose not to\nadopt a specific target? Did th e Committee consider specific targets —there have been a number\nof proposals —and why did you choose not to do that?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, we —the problem is that, for this purpose , that what\nwe’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions . We want to see the\nunemployment rate come down, but that ’s not the only indicator, obviously, of labor market\nconditions . The u nemployment rate came down last month because participation fell . That ’s not\nnecessarily a sign of improvement . So we want to see more jobs . We want to see lower\nunemployment . We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be\nsustained ; it’s not just a one -month or two- month phenomenon. We ’re not going to be looking\nfor little wiggles in the numbers that are going to cause us to radically shift our policy . So, we ,\nat least at this point, have decided to define it qualitativel y. I hope I am giving you at least a\nlittle color in terms of what w e’ll be looking for . We’ll be looking for, again, an economy which\nis quickening, that gives signs of continued improvement, that allows labor markets to be\nstronger, and that will be the type of qualitative criteria that we look at . We don’ t—again, we\ndon’t have a single number that captures that , but we anticipate that we ’ll have to do more, and\nwe’ll do enough to make sure that the economy gets on the right track.\nCRAIG TORRES . Hi, Mr. Chairman . Someone told me that less than 1 percent of all\nmortgages originated in the past 18 months went to borrowers with impaired credit history . So\nwhen we talk about people and a Main S treet policy, it seems like you ’re struggling , like many\nother central banks , and that ’s to get the low rate s down to—the challenge is to get them to\n\nfragile balance sheets . So, given that ’s the case— I mean , you guys got involved in markets\nwhen they were dysfunctional in the crisis . What ’s your appetite for doing more -targeted credit\nprograms if , post -election , you had a Treasury S ecretary and a C ongress that was willing to\nunderwrite some of the credit risk ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, now you’ re talking about congressional programs ,\nand I don’ t, you know, I don’ t advocate specific programs . It’s up to them to make those\ndecisions . I think we ’re seeing modest improvement in mortgage markets . One thing that ’s\nhelping is a stronger housing market . One reason that lenders have been very constrained is they\nare worried about further house price declines that will make the collateral worth less than the loan. As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger , lending\nstandards have eased just a bit . There’ s also been other changes which are useful . I note , for\nexample, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks so that\nbanks will have more certainty abo ut under what conditions a mortgage will be put back to them\nif it defaults . So I think there ’s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a\nlittle bit more open, and that is one factor , actually , that could make our policy more effecti ve\nrather than less effective over time—if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we ’re providing.\nGREG IP . Greg Ip of the Economist . Mr. Chairman, one of the innovations of your\nstatement today is that you have for the first time explicitly predicated your monetary policy action on the achievement of explicit economic goals , in this case a substantial improvement in\nthe labor market . Could you give us some explanation of how that conditioning wil l make your\npolicy more effective than if you had simply done as you previously have : announced the policy\n\nanticipate adjusting the size of your asset purchases in orde r to maintain the $85 billion monthly\nflow of long- term asset purchases?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . On the latter , when Operation T wist ends, we will be\nlooking at the whole set of asset pur chases in order to make decisions . We ’ll be looking at the\nstate of the economy , as we described in the statement . In particular , what ’s the state of the labor\nmarket, what ’s the state of the outlook for economic growth? On conditioning , our policies have\nalways been conditional in that we ’ve always been clear that our asset purchase s, for example,\nwere reviewed periodically to see if they were still necessary, if they needed to be expanded . We\ndid extend the maturity extension program , for example, when we thought that more support was\nneeded for the economy , so our policie s have always had a significant element of conditionality .\nBut the idea here is to make that more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more\nobvious that the Fed will do what ’s needed to provide the support for the economy . And we\nhope that w hat that will do is provide a bit more assurance, maybe a bit more confidence , that the\nFed will be there to do what it can . Again, we ’re not promising, you know, a cure to all these\nills. But what we can do is provide some support , and by assuring the public that we will be\nprepared to take action if the economy falters, we ’re hopeful that that will increase confidence\nand make people more willing to invest, hire , and spend.\nPETER BARNES . Sir , just to follow up on—Peter Barnes with Fox Business —to follow\nup on Darren’ s questions, a question about getting back to full employment . It looks like there ’s\na lot more work to do here . And so I want ed to ask you about your plans as Fed C hairman —\nyour term expires in January of 2014. Governor Romney ’s comm ents notwithstanding , what are\nyour plans? Do you plan to leave at that time ? W ould you consider an appointment to a third\n\nany concern or was there any discu ssion within the C ommittee about whether or not your actions\ntoday might be perceived as helping President Obama, helping the economy , and thus helping\nPresident Obama get reelected and hurting Governor Romney ’s chances in the presidential\ncontest? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , on the former , I’m—I have a lot to do. I am very\nfocused on my work, and I don ’t have any decision or any information to give you on my\npersonal plans . On the politics, we have tried very, v ery hard —and I think we ’ve been\nsuccessful —at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical . We make our decisions\nbased entirely on the state of the economy and the needs of the economy for policy\naccommodation . So we just don’ t take those factors into account , and we think that ’s the best\nway to maintain our independence and maintain the trust of the public.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman , Donna Borak with American Banker . My question\npertains to Basel III. Community bankers , as you know , have been very worried about the\nimpact that t hese rules will have on their banks , especially given the fact that there’ s been some\nindustry consolidation, and some have even questioned whether or not the Fed has actually\nlooked at the impact that the rules would have on smaller -sized institutions . So my question for\nyou is , will there be relief for the smaller institutions , and can you provide any assurance that this\nwill not be a one -size-fits-all regulation ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Certainly . We are very interested in and very focused on\ncommunity banks at the Fed . We believe they play a very important role in our economy and in\nour communities . We have a number of ways of communicating with community banks . It\nincludes our advisory council made up of comm unity bankers . It includes a special set of\n\nviews . I speak regularly to conventions and the like and talk to various groups . In terms of\nBasel III, of course , it’s not one -size-fits-all. Many —and, indeed , many of the most difficult,\ncomplex regulations apply only to the largest and most complex institutions —for example, the\ncapital surcharge that the largest banks have to hold, t he complex rule s applying to trading books\nand derivatives, the extra supervision under section 165, the orderly liquidation authority, the\nliquidity rules —the whole range of things that apply only to the largest , most complex , and\ninternationally active banks . For the smaller banks , what our propose d rule does is try to\nstrength en their capital, and many small banks will already meet those capital requirements .\nSmalls banks tend to be very well capitalized . But , of course , it’s important for small banks to\nbe well capitalized as well as large banks . And there’ s a leve rage requirement . But , again , most\nof the rules, most of the —particularly the most complex rules in Basel III will not apply to the\nsmaller banks . Indeed, banks under $500 million have special exemptions from these rules .\nHaving said all of that , I remind you that what we have now is a proposed rule , and we ’re\nreceiving comment on that . We have a subcommittee of our supervision committee with two\nexperienced —one community banker, one community bank supervisor on it from our B oard who\nare particularly i nterested in making sure that the rules are not excessively onerous , and we will\nbe looking at the comments and trying to make sure that we take into account the needs of\ncommunity banks when we put out the rule.\nGREG ROBB . Thank you, Mr. Chairman . Yest erday former Fed Governor Larry Meyer\nat a conference in Washington said he ’d never seen such a divided Fed. And we see it, we who\ncover the Fed see it in the speeches , in the run -up to today ’s decision . Some people said that it\nwas dubious whether Q E3 would work. Could you comment on former Governor Meyer ’s\n\nofficials who don’ t support QE would keep their —keep their fears to themselves ? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE . Well , as you know , we are living in a very complex time\nand dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues ,\nincluding new policies that haven’ t been used in the same way in the past, and so naturally we\nhave a r ange of views, a range of opinions . I think on the whole that ’s probably a good thing .\nIt’s good to hear different points of view , and it ’s good to make sure that the points of view that\nare outside the Fed are reflected in the discussion around the tabl e inside the Fed . So we have a\nvery collaborative and collegial discussion process , that , again —that spans a range of views . We\nwere, however , able to come to a pretty good consensus —as you know , the vote on this was 11\nto 1—and that ’s a sign that the broad center of the Committee does support these actions and will\ncontinue to support them going forward.\nGREG ROBB . Does the negative commentary hurt QE ? Could it , if people in the\nmarket don’ t think it will work?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . There ’s going to be negative commentary whether it comes\nfrom Fed officials or not . Again, because there’ s a range of views —some people think it ’s more\neffective than others . I discussed some of the evidence in my speech in Jackson Hole , and I\ntalked abo ut the fact that, you know, different researchers have gotten different estimates of the\nimpact . Virtually all of them find that there is some beneficial impact, but they disagree on how\nmuch . So, there ’s going to be disagreement . And again, I personall y don ’t think that it’ s a\npanacea, I personally don ’t think it’ s going to solve the problem . But I do think it has enough\nforce to help nudge the economy in the right direction.\n\nenough tools to deal with the unemployment problem . I was curious to know what policy\nactions you ’d like to see outside the Fed to try and address this . And, secondly, also on the\n“fiscal cliff, ” the expected spending cuts and tax increases, how concerned are you about that?\nAnd what ammunition do you have to deal with that, if that becomes a problem?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well there ’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be\ntaken, and I can ’t really prescribe all those possible responses . I would focus, I think, on the\nfiscal side . We cur rently have the so -called fiscal cliff . If no action is taken, there ’s going to be\na very substantial increase in taxes and cut in spending on January 1 of the coming year . The\nCBO has suggeste d that if that’s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to\nbegin to rise , and it might throw the economy back into recession. So I think one very basic\nthing that could be done to help address the recovery —the weakness of the recovery and the\nneed for more employment —would be to address the fiscal clif f while simultaneously addressing\nlonger -term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious . So that ’s one area\nwhere there is a lot of potential benefit . If the fiscal cliff is n’t addressed, as I ’ve said, I don ’t\nthink our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock, so we ’d have to\nthink about what to do in that contingency . So I think it ’s really important for the fiscal\npolicymakers to, you know, work together and try to find a solution for that.\nPATRICK WELTER . Mr . Chairman, my name is Patrick Welter with the German\nnewspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. I have two questions , if I may. One is in the\nprojections . In the economic and inflation projections , you foresee a low inflation r ate below\n2 percent to 2015—not you personally , but the FOMC . I am wondering , if you look at the\ngrowth rate s, you have growth rates of about 3.4 perc entage points in 2014 and 2015. How long\n\nthe second question, if I may , is, a lot of economist s don’ t see too much effect out of the further\nround of QE3. Aren ’t you worried that , in promising that you will do whatever you can, even if\nit is tiny, small, that you give some kind of carte blanche to the fiscal policy and to the C ongress\nnot to do enough on their side of the policy action?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point\nwhat ’s normal in a recovery, which is , given that the economy fell very quickly and there ’s a lo t\nof unused capacity, there ’s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be\na peri od where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack\nthat was created . So we don’ t anticipate the economy is going to be overheating anytime soon .\nAnd as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the\neconomy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target . On your second question,\ncertainly , there is a range of views on how effective these tools are . I’ve spent a lot of time , as\nall of my colleagues have , looking at the evidence, and, of course , the staff here have done a\ngreat deal of work on the question. And the bottom line for most of it, most of the research, is that while these tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem, they are at least able to\nprovide meaningful support to the economy . Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our\nmandate, which is maximum employment and price stability . So if we have tools that we think\ncan provide some assistance and we’ re not meeting our mandate , then I think that our obligation\nis to do what we can . Of course , we would like to see policies across the board to help address\nthese issues . But, you know, that ’s not our province; we are the monetary policy authorit ies, and\nour job is to use monetary policy as effectively as we can.\n\nraised , questions raised by people like Columbia Professor Michael Woodford and others about\nthe credibility of your forward guidance on the path, the future path of the federal funds rate —\nthe idea being that , to the extent it’ s conditional, it ’s not really convincing and doesn’ t provide\nthe kind of confidence that you re ferred to . Now, on this latest statement, you’ve removed some\nof that conditionality . I am particularly struck by the statement that “ the C ommittee expects that\na highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable\ntime after the economic recovery strengthens .” I assume that was done to make your forward\nguidance more credible, and yet the question remains whether, you know, as the economy picks\nup steam, whether the FOMC will really follow through and keep rates lo w or whether you will\ndo as the Fed has always done and begin to raise the funds rate.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, that’ s an important question. Michael Woodford—\nwho, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well , and\nI know his works quite well —I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward\nguidance—communication about future policy —is, in fact , the most powerful tool that central\nbanks have when the interest rate is close to zero . And he advocates pol icies like nominal GDP\ntargeting , for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years , the\nimplication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP and promise to do that for\nmany years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy . So his own\nperspective is that credibility is the key tool that central banks have in order to get traction at the zero lower bound. Whether we have the credibility to persuade markets that we’ ll follow\nthrough is an empirical question . And the evidence , which I also , again , discussed in my\nremarks recently , is that when we ’ve announced extended guidance , that financial markets have\n\nunemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation. So the\nempirical evidence is that our announcements do have considerable credibility . And I think\nthere’ s a good reason for that, which is that we have talked a lot both publicly and privately\nabout the rationale for maintaining rates low even as the economy strengthens, and I think the basic ideas are broadly espoused within the Committee . And so there is a consensus that even as\nthe personnel change and so on going forw ard, that this is the appropriate approach, and that by\nfollowing through, we will have created a reserve of credibility that we can use in any subsequent episodes that occur.\nDON LEE . Don Lee with the L.A. Times . With mortgage rates already at historica l\nlows, how much further do you think the actions, your actions , will drive down the rates , and\nrelated to that, I ’m assuming that you expect the purchase s of mortgage -back ed securities to have\na meaningful effect on refinancings and housing activity . Wha t would that look like? What\nwould that meaningful effect mean?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, again , as I mentioned before , it’s true that our\nmortgage -back ed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward\npressure on mortgage rates , and create more demand for homes and more refinancing . But it will\ndepend, again , ultimately on several things . One will be on the amount that we do, the amount of\npurchases that we do, and that in turn is going to be a function of how the economy evol ves. If\nthe economy is weaker, we’ ll do more, and in those case s, probably rates would be pretty low at\nany case because the economy is looking weak . If the economy is stronger, strong enough to\ncreate improving labor market conditions , we won’t have to do as much . And so, the amount\nthat we do depends on how the economy evolves . So, since I don ’t know exactly how much\n\nknow, in terms of how many homes and t hose kinds of questions , again , I think that the markets\nare looking —are l ooking a little better . I think that house prices are beginning to rise in some\nmarkets, which will encourag e people to look at homes , will encourage lenders to make more\nmortgage l oans. So I ’m hopeful that we ’ll see continued progress in the housing market ; that—\nthat has been one of the missing pistons in the engine here . Housing is usually a big part of the\nrecovery process . We haven ’t had that nearly to the usual extent, and to the extent that we can\nsupport housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome.\nDON LEE . There doesn’t seem to be that many people who could qualify for\nrefinancings. C an we expect a meaningful effect on an increase in refinancing activity?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think there ’ll be some, but you get more benefit\nwhen people buy homes . And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily,\nand we ’re trying to provide more support for people who want to go out and buy homes ,\nconstruct homes, and also those who want to refinance . But it’ s the purchase s of new homes that\ngenerate the construction activity , the furnishing , all those things that help the economy grow .\nSCOTT SPOERRY . Scott Spoerry with CNN an d CNNMoney . Earlier this year at one\nof your news conferences in this room , you said that you were already hearing anecdotal\ninformation from some of your colleagues at the r egional Fed Banks about firms, companies\nmaking decisions on hiring next year b ecause they were af raid of the fiscal c liff or whatever the\nfederal government was going to do in terms of—in terms of cutbacks . It’s been a few months\nsince you made that statement , and I’m sure your staff are working hard on it , but how much of a\nheadwind to the economy is the fear of the federal government just s ort of cutting way back ,\nfalling across the fiscal cliff or even —even if they take a few steps back from the cliff , it’s still\n\nthe economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well I—you know, it’s pretty hard to give you a number,\nbut I can certainly confirm that as the R eserve Bank presidents and G overnors made their reports\ntoday and yesterday around the table, there was considerable discussion of uncertainty , including\npolicy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty, and the implications of that for hiring and\ninvestment decisions . A lot of —a lot of firms are waiting to see whether that problem will be\nresolved . And if so, how? And I think it is a concern . It is something that is affecting behavior\nnow. But again, I don’ t know —I don’ t have a number , I don’ t know how big that effect is , but,\ncertainly , the sooner that can be resolved, the sooner it can be clarified , it will be beneficial not\njust because we avoid the cliff itself , but because we clarify for firms, for employers and\ninvestors , how that ’s going to be resolved. So, I think it ’s an issue that is of some consequence,\nyes.\nCATHE RINE HOLLANDER . Hi, Mr. Chairman. Catherine Hollander , National\nJournal . How much was the fiscal cliff a decision , or a factor in your decision, to do an open-\nended QE instead of a fixed sum ? Or fiscal uncertainty more generally?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . We ll, we take the economy as we find it . There are a lot of\nheadwinds right now that are affecting the economy . There ’s fiscal headwinds . There’ s\ninternational factors , including the situation in Europe . There’ s factors arising from still-\nimpaired credit markets , and so on. So we looked at that —looked at the economy from the\nperspective of, you know, how quickly it ’s been growing over the last six months to a year . And,\nas I talked about in a speech in March , in order for employment gains to be sustaine d, for\nunemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels. And lately it’ s not\n\nassure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope , will help bring unemployment down over time .\nNow, again, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty about the fiscal cliff , is one of the factors , one of the\nheadwinds , but I ’m sure there are many others , and we don’ t try to differentiate among them in\nany sense. If the f iscal cliff does occur, I suspect it won’ t, and I hope it won’ t, but if it does, and\nwe get the kind of impact the Congressional B udget O ffice is talking about, as I ’ve said, I don’ t\nthink the Federal R eserve has the tools to offset that , and we would have to rethink at that point .\nBut we ’ve taken the steps we’ ve taken now because we’ d like to see the economy gather more\nmomentum , and the more momentum it has, the better placed we are to deal with any shocks that\nmight come down the road.\nMARCY GORDON. Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press . One of the aspects\nwe’ve seen in recent reports on unemployment is the shrinking labor force . Is that something\nthat’s of specific concern to you, and what does it tell us about the labor market and the\neconomy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , you are absolutely right . And as I mentioned earlier,\nthe unempl oyment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in\nparticipation . Some decline in participation is anticipated , is as expected . We’re an aging\nsociety. We have more people retiring . Female participation has flattened out ; it hasn ’t\ncontinued to climb as it did for several decades . We’re seeing less participation among younger\npeople, fewer college students taking part -time jobs and the like. So part of this decline in\nparticipation was something that we anticipated quite a long time ago, but part of it is cyclical.\nPart of it reflects the fact that some people —because they have essentially given up or at least\nare very discouraged —hav e decided to leave the labor force. And the anticipation is that if the\n\npeople would come back into the labor force . They might even temporarily raise the\nunemployment rate because they ’re now looking again. So the participation rate over and\nabove —the decline in participation rate over and above the downward trend is just one of the\nother indicators of a general ly weak labor market . And it’s why I said ea rlier that we do want to\nlook at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate , although that ’s a very important\nindicator , not just payrolls , although that also is a leading indicator , but participation, hours, part -\ntime work , and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite\nweak condition.\nThank you."
