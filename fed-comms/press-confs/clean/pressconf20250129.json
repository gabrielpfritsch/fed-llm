  "text": "CHAIR POWELL . Good afternoon . My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people . The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant\nprogress toward our goals over the past two years . Labor market conditions have cooled from\ntheir formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our\n2 percent longer -run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings . I’ll have more\nto say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments .\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace .\nFor 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer\nspending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter\nbut was strong for the year overall . Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the\nhousing sector seems to have stabilized .\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid . Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per\nmonth over the past three months . Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has\nstabilized since the middle of last year and , at 4.1 percent in December, remains low . Nominal\nwage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed . Overall, a\nwide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance . The\nlabor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures .\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer -run goal . Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other\n\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent .\nLonger -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets .\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people . We see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate .\nOver the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full\npercentage point from its peak . That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light\nof the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market . With our policy stance\nsignificantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need\nto be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance . At today ’s meeting, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal fund s rate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent .\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on\ninflation . At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly\nweaken economic activity and employment . In considering the extent and timing of additional\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks . We’re not on any preset course .\nAs the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes\nour maximum- employment and price -stability goals . If the economy remains —economy\nremains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can\n\nmaintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or\ninflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Policy is\nwell positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate .\nAs we previously announced, our five -year review , review of our monetary policy\nframework is taking place this year . At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by\nreviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews . Our review will again include\noutreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events\naround the country and a research conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings . We intend to wrap up the review by late summer . I would note that\nthe Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus\nof the review .\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy : maximum employment and\nstable prices . We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -run inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country . Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals . Thank you. I look forward to your questions .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Steve .\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr . Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC . Mr . Chairman, al l\nright, at an event in Davos —or from , to Davos , anyway—the P resident said he’ll demand that\ninterest rates drop immediately . So I guess I have a three -part question. H as the P resident done\nthis to you? Has he made that demand ? Secondly, what is your response to that ? And , third,\nwhat effect, if any thing —if any , does a President making these kind of remarks have on policy?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Three questions . I’m seeing , seeing it really as one question , though.\nSo, I, I ’m not going to have —I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever\non, on what the P resident ’s said. It’s not appropriate for me to do so. The public should be\nconfident that we will continue to do our work as we always have —focusing on using our tools\nto achieve our goals , and really keeping our heads down and doing our work. And that ’s how we\nbest serve the public .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Could you just comment on whether he ’s physically communicated\nhis demand to you?\nCHAIR POWELL . I’ve had no contact .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Thanks .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nick .\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, you and\nseveral of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was\n“meaningfully restrictive .” Given economic and financial market developments since then, how\nhas your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully restrictive ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . I don’ t think that my assessment really has changed . I mean , a\ncouple of things have happened. W e’ve gotten more strong data, but we ’ve also seen rates move\nup at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions . I think if we look\nback over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive. If you look at the effect of\nhigh rates on interest -sensitive spending —for example , in housing—and if you look at the\nachievement of our goal variables, we ’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation\nand, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so. Though we literally look at the —at\nthe—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment . Now, policy is\nmeaningfully less restrictive than it was before we beg an to cut . It’s 100 basis points less\nrestrictive . And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on\ninflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we— before we consider\nmaking adjustments .\nNICK TIMIRAOS . If I could follow up. Does the economy here warrant meaningfully\nrestrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if you were to lower them by another ¼ point ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, I , I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I\nmentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals . We, we want to —policy\nto be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation goal. At the same time, we don ’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve\nthat goal, and that ’s kind of what we ’ve been getting. The labor market has really been broadly\nstable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months . Conditions seem to\nbe broadly in balance . And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see\nwe don’ t—we don’ t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings . But, nonetheless, the\n\nlast couple of readings have suggested , you know, more positive readings . So I, I think we ’re—I\nthink policy ’s well, well positioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Colby, from the New York Times.\nCOLBY SMITH. Colby Smith, with the New York Times. Chair Powell, how should we\ninterpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the\n2 percent goal ? Is that no longer the case ?\nCHAIR POWELL . No, so let me look —if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a\nlittle bit of language cleanup there . We took out a reference to “ since earlier in the year ” as it\nrelated to the labor market, a nd we just chose to , to shorten that sentence. Again, I , I mean, if\nyou look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was—there was another inflation reading, I guess , just before the December meeting . So, we ’ve got two, two good\nreadings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation . Again, we ’re not going to\noverinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than\nthis: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving\nour 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.\nCOLBY SMITH. And just to follow up: W e’ve seen inflation expectations across a\nnumber of measures rise sharply —which has , in part , been linked to tariff concerns . But there ’s\nalso been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices . So how\nwould you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially\nthose tied to policies related to the Trump Administration ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the\nshort end— but not at the longer run, which [ is] where it really matters . And those could be\nrelated to —could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies . I think where the\n\nCommittee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted . We, a nd we ,\nwe don’ t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with\nregulatory policy . We ’re only just beginning to see —actually , are not really beginning to see\nmuch, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even\nbegin to make a , a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be . So\nwe’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do . This is no different than any\nother set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an A dministration . We’ ll patiently watch\nand understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of\nunderstanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. You and\nyour colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, “ if the economy\ndevelops as we anticipate. ” Is it fair to say that since there ’s a lot unknown about what this\nAdministration ’s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don’ t have a medium - to long-\nterm economic forecast that you can have confidence in? Or, if that ’s not true, can you lay out\nwhat you think is going to happen in the economy, how you s ee it developing ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, at all times —at all times , forecasts are conditional, at a\nminimum, on just a set of expectations, and , and they’ re highly uncertain in both directions . We ,\nwe know that economic forecasting is , is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out. So in\nthe current situation, there ’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of , of, you know,\nsignificant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned : tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal\npolicy, and, and regulatory policy. So there ’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that\nshould be passing; we should go through that . And then we ’ll be back to the regular amount of\n\nuncertain . You know, what, what forecasters are doing —not just us, but everybody’ s doing—is\nthey’ ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they ’re really kind of\nin the nature of a placeholder , and— meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you\nwouldn’ t stand behind it because you just don’ t know, and so you’ re just —you’ re just on hold,\nwaiting to see what comes down. You know, i t’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect\nit at the margin, but we ’ll, you know, we ’re going to wait and see .\nMICHAEL MCKEE . If I could follow up. T he idea that you feel the—that policy is\nrestrictive suggests that the Fed , in general , wants to continue to lower interest rates . So when\nyou look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can\ncut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, we ’re—we’re looking—it ’s more the other —the way —\nthe way it works is , we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do. And , you know,\nthat, that’s what we do . And right now , we feel like we’ re in a very good place . Policy ’s well\npositioned. The economy’s in, in quite a good place , actually, as well . And what, what we do\nexpect is to see further progress on inflation, and , you know, as I mentioned, as we see that —or\nif we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster —we could then be in a position\nof, of making further adjustments . But, right now , we, we don ’t see that, and we see things as in\na really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’ t need to be in a\nhurry to, to make any adjustments.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Howard .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters . Thank you very much. In\n2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, “ Throughout my career in both public and\nprivate sectors, I’ ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that\n\nhave a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion. These organizations\nconsistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world -class workforce. ”\nQuestion, first question is, do you still believe that ? And if so, how do you intend to put that\nbelief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting diversity and inclusion efforts ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So let me say, “ yes,” in answer to your first question . But, to the\nsecond question, I want to say this : We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the\nassociated details as they are made available. A nd as has been our practice over many\nAdministrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate\nand consistent with applicable law . And I want to add that I ’m not going to have anything more\nspecific for you today on this whole set of issues .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, if I could just follow up quickly on that . I’m wondering\nhow you’ re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd- Frank law ’s stipulations about\nmaintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion .\nCHAIR POWELL. So I did—I did mention “consistent with applicable law, ” right ?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Which is governing.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Elizabeth .\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News. Just to\nfollow up on Steve ’s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed\nwill continue to operate independent of politics under this A dministration ?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I’ve —as I ’ve said countless times over the years, this\nis—this is who we are ; this is what we do . We study the data, we , we analyze how it will affect\nthe outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,\n\nour best thinking, try to achieve our goals . That ’s what we do ; that’s always what we do . Don ’t\nlook for us to do anything else . And that ’s—you know, lots of research shows that ’s the—that ’s\nthe best way for a central bank to operate . That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve\nthese goals for the benefit of the American people . That ’s always what we’ re going to do. A nd\npeople should have confidence in that , as I —as I said a few minutes ago .\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. You ’ve said that the Fed is in wait- and-see mode, based on\nthe policies that come out of this A dministration . Has the Fed started to model what policies like\nmass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the\nworkforce and for inflation ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So one of the things our , our staff does is they , they look at a range\nof possible outcomes , and , and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you\nknow, it’ s, it’s one of the best things that they do. And i n each Tealbook —you can look at the\nfive-year-old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations . So that ’s what they do. They, it’ ll\nbe a baseline, and then they’ ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones\nand, and not -so-good ones . And wha t those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to\nsort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this . So,\nyes, we, we —staff does that, and we, we’ re all well aware that there are —that the range of\npossibilities is always broad , and—not just now , but always . And you have to—it ’s hard to be\nopen to just how , how broad the possibilities are for an economy. You know, no one saw the\npandemic coming , and it was —you know, it changed everything. So things happen, and—but\nyes, we do—we do do that . But it’ s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what\nmight happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’ t act until\nyou—until you see much more than we see now .\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News . You know , last month\nyou talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more\nprogress in inflation . With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would\nyou say that that ’s even more so the case now ?\nCHAIR POWELL . I’d say it ’s the same. You know, we, w e want to see, you know,\nfurther progress on inflation . And, you know, the story ’s there . It’s, it’s—we ’re just going to\nhave to see the data. At the end of the day, it , it comes down to 12- month inflation , because that\ntakes out the seasonality issues that may exist . And, you know, we ’re, we’re just going to need\nto see that . We think that —we think we see the pathway for that to happen. One , one\nexample —a key example —is that you now do see owner ’s equivalent rent and , you know,\nhousing services —the way it ’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty\nsteadily now , and that ’s the—that ’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is . In\naddition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services\n[prices], which don’ t tend to send much signal [about future inflation]. So you can look through\nall that and, and think, “O kay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress .” But being\nseem to set up for it is one thing ; having it is another . So we, we ’re going to want to see further,\nfurther progress on inflation . Remember, we ’re not, you know, we’re, we ’re under —2 percent,\nbut our goal is 2 percent , and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent .\nCATARINA SARAIVA. And , and in terms of the labor market, I mean , how —is that\nbroadly—you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it ’s in pretty solid place. Was\nthere broad agreement on that ? There ’s been a few underlying indicators that are showing\n\nperhaps some weakness: a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it’ s increasingly\ndifficult to find a job . Is that of concern to the Committee ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So you’ re right . I mean , we look at, of course, a very broad range .\nAnd, so , it starts with unemployment —sorry , with, yeah, with the unemployment rate,\nemployment participation, wages, job quits —are people quitting? —that kind of thing. The ratio\nof vacancies to unemployed. We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger , though,\non—it’ s a low —it’s a low -hiring environment . So if you have a job, it ’s all—it’s all good, but if\nyou—if you have to find a job, the job- finding rate —the hiring rates have come down . And\nthat’s, that ’s more typical of a —let’s say —let’s say that the unemployment —that the —that th e\nlabor market is at a sustainable level . It’s not overheated anymore . We don ’t think we need it to\ncool off anymore . We do watch it extremely carefully . It’s one of our two goal variables . But ,\nyeah, I, I ’d say we watch those things quite carefully . But nonetheless, overall , look at the\naggregate data in the labor market. It does seem to—the labor market does seem, seem to be\npretty stable and broadly in balance . When you’ ve got a, an unemployment rate that is —that has\nbeen pretty stable now for , for a, a full half a year .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Edward .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thank you. T hank you, Mr . Chairman . Edward Lawrence\nwith F ox Business. On employment, now , you said there ’s a broad range of possibilities, but last\nSeptember you said, quote, “ We understand that there ’s been quite an influx across the borders ,\nand that has actually been one of things that ’s allowed unemployment rate to rise. ” Now that the\nflow over the border has slowed and we ’re seeing deportations, how do you expect the\nunemployment rate to react?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, s o what ’s happening is that the , the flows across the\nborder have decreased very significantly, and there ’s every reason to expect that to continue .\nAnd so—but job creation has come down a bit , too, so, you know, if those two things come\ndown together, that , that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize . In other\nwords, a breakeven rate —as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in\nnew jobs to make —to, to make jobs for , for workers declines as well . So that seems to be\nsomething about what ’s happening. You, you do see a very —a very flat unemployment rate at a\ntime when you’ ve seen significant declines [in job growth] .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . I want to ask you about Fed employment . I know that tax\nmoney is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is, quote, “ absurdly overstaffed. ”\nWe’ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce . I just want to get your\nreaction .\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, we, w e run a very careful budget process where we ’re\nfully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the —we owe that to the public , and we believe we\ndo that . I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Chris .\nCHRIS RUGABER. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. President Trump has said he\nwill lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs . Do you see such costs as a particular\ndriver of inflation , and would lowering them have a dramatic effect ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Chris, I ’m not going to—I ’m not going to react or discuss anything\nthat, that any elected politician might say . So I ’ll give you a mulligan.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Okay, oh, thank you. Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it\nwas withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as, you know, even\n\nas we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage . And , of\ncourse, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address\nclimate change. Many commentators did see the timing as political. Why did you leave that organization ? Can you explain that decision?\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure, I ’d be glad to. So we considered this , you know, really at\nlength, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS . And, really , the reason is that the, the\nwork that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly. Think about nature -related risks and\nbiodiversity and things like that . In addition, the , the work of the NGFS is , is, in, in significant\npart intended to—and this is a quote —“mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition\ntoward a sustainable economy. ” So we joined t o get the benefit of understanding what other\ncentral banks were doing and , and seeing research and things like that . I think this is just way\nbeyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow\nrole, as I ’ve—as I’ve said many times, and I think that , that the activities of the NGFS are not a\ngood fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority. So, you know , and I just think it\nwas time to acknowledge that . You know, the, t he process —this process dates back —thinking\nabout it dates back a couple of years . I made the decision to bring this to the Board , you know,\nsome months ago . It just—it just— the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when —\nthis is when we , we got in and voted on it, so. A nd I’m aware of how it can look, but it was\nreally not driven by politics ; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the\nNGFS and our mandate . Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS .\nWe have no, no criticism of them. B ut it just isn ’t—it’s not right for the Fed.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Andrew .\n\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Th anks. Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post . I’m\nwondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers .\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, 2 percent —inflation down to—inflation down to 2 percent\nsustainably is what , what we’re trying to achieve . You know, we’re, w e’re somewhat above that,\nas you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that\nwe’re making further progress on inflation . That ’s what we want to see. And consumers will,\nwill pick that up, of course , in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store .\nANDREW ACKERMAN. The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you\nthink you are from neutral .\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah, you can’ t know with any precision, of course . As I like to say,\nthat you know that —you know the neutral rate by its works . So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent\nwe’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee ’s estimates of the longer -run\nneutral . I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy.\nThat’s really the question we ask . You know, you can consult models, empirical models,\ntheoretical models . You really have to just look out the window and see how your —how your\npolicy rate is affecting the economy. And I think we see that it’ s having meaningful effects in\nbringing inflation under control . It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well . So\nthat’s what we think. I , I would say we ’re meaningfully above it . I, I am—I, I have no illusion\nthat, that anyone knows precisely how much that is . And , but it, you know —not knowing that,\nand having cut 100 basis points, means that it ’s appropriate that we —that we not be in a hurry to\nmake further adjustments .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Victoria .\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico . So, as a general matter, when it\ncomes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes,\nnever, or do you just often voluntarily comply? What is—what is the legality there ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So it ’s been —it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align\nour policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders . And that ’s—I’m just going\nto leave it at that . As I mentioned, I ’m not going to—I ’m not going to go any deeper than that\nor, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES . Claire Jones from the Financial Times . Two questions , if I may , on\ntariffs . Well , first of all, we ’ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around.\nBut then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth. If we see tariffs of\nthe same sort of magnitude that we got then —which I know is a big if —what do you think might\nbe different this time around ? And , secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the\nthreat of tariffs was a big driver of the cut by the Bank of Canada today. What sort of\ninformation would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive move ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Sorry , make a —?\nCLAIRE JONES . To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs ?\nWould you need to see a strategy, a ctual implementation , actual movement of inflation\nexpectations , before you ’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of\nit?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we just —so first of all, thing, things are a little different now .\nWe’ve just come through a high- inflation period, and you can argue that both ways . You can—\n\nyou can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but , but we also\nhear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and\nso I don’ t know how that shakes out . Nonetheless, you’ re coming through a situation where\nwe’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different.\nIn addition, you know, the trade —the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as\ntrade is now spread around the , you know —it’ s not as concentrated in China as it was . There\nwas a lot more manufacturing . It moved to Mexico and other places . So, so there were\ndifferences, and I just think the , the range of possibilities is , is very, very wide . We just don ’t\nknow , and I , I don’ t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don ’t know .\nAnd we didn’ t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018. Yeah, we didn’ t really know . And it, you\nknow, the —again, the range of possibilities , very, very wide . We don’ t know what ’s going to be\ntariff. We don ’t know for how long or how much, what countries . We don ’t know about\nretaliation . We don’ t know how it ’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers .\nThat’s, that really does remain to be seen . You know, t here are lots of places where that —where\nthat—where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a\nconsumer . Just so many variables. So we ’re just going to have to wait and see . And, you know,\nthe best we can do is what we’ ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at\nhistorical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then we’ll just have to see —have to see how it —how it goes .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thank you. Courtenay Brown from Axios . Two unrelated\nquestions . The first is whether or not there was any discussion about QT and the timeline for\nending QT at this meeting . And then the second question is just —I wonder if the AI -prompted\n\nselloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial\nconditions .\nCHAIR POWELL . So, on Q T, on— let’s, let’s talk about runoff . So the most recent data\ndo suggest that reserves are still abundant . Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when\nrunoff began. And the f ederal f unds r ate has been very steady within the target range . We track\na, a bunch of metrics , and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant . We do intend to\nreduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that ’s consistent with implementing monetary\npolicy efficiently and effectively in our ample -reserves regime. We’ re closely monitoring a, a\nrange of indicators to assess conditions , and that should provide signals whether reserves are\napproaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “ somewhat above ample. ” I, I don’t have\nanything to say to you about particular dates ; it’s just that ’s the process, and what we see is, is\nthat, that rates do appear to be abundant . As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to\nsupport the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach\nfor reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments .\nOn, on AI, it’ s a big event in , in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock\nmarket. I mean , what, what really matters for us is macro developments , and that means\nsubstantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time . So I wouldn’ t\nput that label on, on these events, although of course we ’re all watching it with interest.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Simon .\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist , thank you. You\nmentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized. At the\nsame time, since your first rate cut in September, long -term mortgage rates have gone up by a\nfull percentage point, back above 7 percent . I’m w ondering, kind of looking forward, do you\n\nthink—are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are ?\nHow does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as you know, as we ’ve reduced our , our policy rate 100 basis\npoints, longer rates have gone up. Not because of expectations—not principally because of\nexpectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story . So, and, you\nknow, it’ s long rates that matter for, for housing. So I, I don’ t think —I think these higher rates\nare going to —they’ re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent , if they ’re\npersistent . We’ll have to see how long they persi st. So, you know, we, we are—we control an\novernight rate . Generally , it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including\ninterest rates . But in this particular case, it’ s all happened at a time when , for reasons unrelated\nto our policy, longer rates have moved up.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Jennifer .\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance . You said you want to see further progress on inflation. Given that households\nappear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again ?\nCHAIR POWELL . No, I wouldn’ t say that . We, w e’ve never said we need to be all the\nway at target to reduce rates. At , at any time , what we ’re doing is we ’re looking at the economy\nand asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price stability . So I, I think if —we would want to see further progress , but we think our —we think\nour—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive . Meaningfully restrictive . Not\nhighly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive . And so I would think we need to see fur ther\n\nprogress . I wouldn’ t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although\nwe’d love to see that, of course, and we will .\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And a separate question for you, on tariffs . Curious\nwhether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty\nfor business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on\ngrowth. Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast ?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, w e—I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the\nconduct of tariffs . You know, i t’s not our job, and it ’s not our job to comment on the moves that\npeople make . So I , I wouldn’ t want to criticize anything that ’s happening or really comment on\nit one way or another —praise it , for that matter. It ’s just not our job .\nI do think that —you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on\ntrade policy uncertainty , trade policy uncertainty, if it ’s large and persistent, can start to matter\nfor businesses making investment decisions and things like that . That ’s not something I ’m\nobserving today. It’ s very early days for this. B ut that did —I think that did matter in 2018 –19.\nAnd, and it’ s one, you know, one of many things we ’ll be watching .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Matt Egan .\nMATT EGAN . Thank you, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN . Following up on\nCourtenay’ s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about\npotential asset bubble brewing in financial markets ? How do relatively high market valuations\nfactor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further? Is that something that’s in the back of your mind?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we , we look—we look at , from a financial stability perspective , at\nasset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the\n\nbanking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that . But it ’s just one of the four things,\nasset prices are. And , yeah, I, I ’d say they’ re elevated by , by many metrics right now . A good\npart of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we , we look at that . But , you know,\nwe also —we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are\nto those things . So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective , and we think\nthat there ’s a lot of resilience out there . Banks have high capital, and households are actually,\noverall —not all households , but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape\nfinancially these days . So that ’s how we think about that . I, you know, w e, we also—we look at\noverall financial conditions, and you’ ve got —you can’ t just take —you can ’t just take equity\nprices. Y ou’ve got to look at rates , too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in\nconditions , with higher rates . So, overall , financial conditions are probably still somewhat\naccommodative, but it ’s a mixed bag .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Richard .\nRICHARD ESCOBEDO. Hi , Chair Powell. I ’m Richard Escobedo with CBS News .\nOne question for you. T his month ’s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low\nrate and that the labor market is solid . You walked through some of what ’s driving this, but I\nwonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment .\nCHAIR POWELL . Well , the things we watch , we discussed earlier . One, one is , is that\nthere ’s a low hiring rate . And so that if , if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were\nto start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the\nhiring rate is quite low . So that, that ’s one thing we look at .\nI think it ’s also —it’s worth pointing out that for lower -income households, they are —\nthey’ re under significant pressure . And in the aggregate , the numbers are good, but we know\n\nthat people at the lower end of the income spectrum are , are struggling with, with costs . And ,\nreally , it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life . It’s not so much the inflation now ; it’s the\nprice level , because inflation has raised prices. I nflation is now closer —much closer to target,\nbut people are really feeling that. But , you know, overall, this is a good labor market . Here\nyou’re at 4.1 percent unemployment . That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ ve been\nsolidly there now for six, seven months . And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold\nthe unemployment rate there, given , given that , you know, there ’ll be much slower population\ngrowth.\nRICHARD ESCOBEDO. One more question. S ome of the uncertainty around\nimmigration policy . Is—in your assessment, is that making i t harder for businesses and the Fed\nto plan going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, we hear anecdotal reports , but I, I don ’t see—there ’s\nnothing in the data yet on that . But you do—you hear —you hear that kind of thing about\nconstruction, for example . And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant\nlabor are , are saying that it ’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people . But I, again —I\nknow —you don’ t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nick .\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI . Thank you, Chair Powell . Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’ s.\nThe uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I ’m wondering, are there any periods from your\ncareer , or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’ s going on here in Washington and beyond,\nor from lessons from history , that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in\nuncertain times like today ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . I guess I ’d say this : Uncertainty is , is with us all the time . It’s, it is\nhuman nature , apparently , to underestimate the —how fat the tails are , in a way, that , you know,\nthe, the possibility —we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it ’s not a\nnormal distribution . The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your\nexpectations . It’s never not that way. I wouldn’ t—you know, if you—if you think about it —\nthink about the first few months of the pandemic . That was uncertainty . Are we going to be able\nto reopen the economy? If so, when ? How much of it ? How long will it take ? You know, t hat\nwas uncertainty . What we have now is a good labor market . We have the economy growing at ,\nyou know, 2 to 2½ percent . Inflation ’s come down to, to now the, you know —the headli ne\ninflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that ’s what the public experiences. We look at —we look\nat core because it ’s a better indicator of future inflation . So, yes, the price level went up a lot for\ninflation, and people are feeling that , and, and they’ re not wrong. But I —so the kind of\nuncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy. B ut then\npolicies —which are , you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise , really —those are —those are\npolicies which people are, have been elected to implement . They’re implementing them with a\nview to , to making a better economy. And so I , I don’ t think —I wouldn’ t call this out as , as a—\nas one of those times. I wouldn’ t compare it to the Global F inancial C risis or anything like that,\ngiven that we have actually a very good economy right now .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Evan .\nEVAN RYSER. Evan R yser with Market News International. Chair Powell, is a March\ncut still on the table ? And then, additionally, are you looking to see better -than- expected data on\ninflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as , as I mentioned, the economy’ s strong, the labor market ’s\nsolid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation\ncontinues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path. That tells me and the other members of the\nCommittee —the broad sense of the Committee , actually , is that we don’ t need to be in a hurry to\nadjust our policy stance . Your second question was ?\nEVAN RYSER. Whether or not you need to see better -than-expected inflation data or\njust inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts .\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, it ’s one of those things we ’ll know it when we see it . But\nmore , more the—the expectation is that we will make continued progress , and, you know, that ’s\nwhat we want . We, w e’ll know it when we see it . When we —it, i t’s going to have to be\nsomething that isn ’t just idiosyncratic . You’re going to want to see , you know, continued\nprogress with housing services inflation; you’ re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way\nthat builds confidence that we are really making progress . That’s what it’s going to be . And , I\nmean, is, is that better than our expectations ? If we expect to see that, it ’s just a question of\nwhen .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Scott .\nSCOTT HORSLEY . Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsley from NPR . In your five -year\nreview , you said the , the 2 percent inflation target won ’t be on the table . Can you talk a little\nabout why? Is that because you think that ’s the right target, or is it because you don’ t want to\nmove the goalpost midgame, or what’s, what ’s behind that ?\nCHAIR POWELL . I think to —I think that goal has served us well over a long period of\ntime. It’s also the sort of global standard. I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at\nchanging that, you wouldn’ t do it at a time when you’ re not meeting it anyway. I would not look\n\nat changing it anyway, b ut I certainly wouldn ’t look at , at it at a time when you’ re not —when\nyou’re not meeting it . I mean , there ’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all\nunclear . We ’re not —we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.\nSCOTT HORSLEY . And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided , it\nwas you’ re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to , to head off inflation until you see\nsort of the whites of the eyes of inflation , because the solid labor market was so beneficial. Have\nthe last few years changed your thinking about that ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So what we really said was that we wouldn ’t—we wouldn’ t look at\na—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation . So the\nthought was that we ’d seen really low levels of inflation —sorry, of unemployment —with no\nsign of inflation . So why would you preemptively want to— want to put people out of work in\nthe absence of , of any kind of —any evidence that suggested that , that this was not a sustainable\nlevel ? It was a way of , of acknowledging how much humility we have about , about the starred\nvariables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment . So, that was a—that , that was an\ninsight . We’ll, we’ll discuss that again . That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss . But I\ndon’t think that insight is wrong . We didn’ t—you know, we, we —what we said was that , you\nknow, in—at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we , we would likely allow\ninflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time . That ’s what we said . That was—\nturned out not to be relevant to what actually happened. There was nothing moderate about the\novershoot . It was —it was an exogenous event . It was the pandemic, and it happened , and, you\nknow, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that that’s what we should do. Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—w e, we\nlooked at the inflation as , as transitory , and—right up to the point where the data turned against\n\nthat, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our , our view , and we raised\nrates a lot , and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down. But the\nframework was, was more irrelevant than anything else . The, the, that part of it— that part of it\nwas irrelevant. T he rest of the framework worked just fine as , as we used i t, as it supported what\nwe did to bring inflation down.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Go to Mark for the last question .\nMARK HAMRICK. Hello , Chairman Powell . Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. As you\nknow , in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks\noutlined is cryptocurrency. Could you talk about those risks now ? And regarding individuals\nand households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that\nspeculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well -being, or do you think it\nhas a place in a household’ s portfolio ?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so our , our role with Bitcoin , really , is to look at —with\ncrypto, really, is to look at the banks , and, and, you know, we , we think it ’s—you know, banks\nare perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks and its safe, safe and soundness. Many of our —a good number of our banks that we regulate and\nsupervise do that . You know, t he threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto\nactivities, and that ’s because they ’re so n ew, and, you know, we don’ t want to make the mistake\nyou’re —if you—if you’ re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside\nthe federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it ’s a safe\nand sound activity. So, you know, we ’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’ t\nwant to , to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are\n\nperfectly legal just because of , of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and\nsupervision, so.\nMARK HAMRICK. And with respect to households and their inclusion in that asset\nclass?\nCHAIR POWELL . I, you know, t hat’s, that’s kind of a —it’s not really our , our\nbailiwick . You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they\nhave , and that ’s why we have , you know, the securit ies law, laws that we have. I t’s why, you\nknow, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want\nhouseholds to have the chance to understand the risk that they ’re taking. And, you know, I , I do\nthink it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think that, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot . We’ve actuall y spent a lot of time ,\nyou know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things , and I , I\nthink that would be a very constructive thing for , for Congress to do.\nThank you."
