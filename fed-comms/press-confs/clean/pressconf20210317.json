  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. I would like to start by noting that it has been a full\nyear since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores. Looking back, it was clear that\naddressing a fast -moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health -\ncare providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice. The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear. Congress provided by far\nthe fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, health -care providers, and state and local governments.\nHere at the Federal Reserve, we rapidl y deployed our full range of tools to provide relief\nand stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that\nCongress has given us: maximum employment and price stability.\nThe economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective,\nwe can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action —from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the\ncountry. More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions. And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent. At the Fed, we will\ncontinue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.\nToday the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.\nThese meas ures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will\nensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\n\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significa ntly on the course of the virus and\nthe measures undertaken to control its spread. Since January, the number of new cases,\nhospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. In the meantime, continued observance of social -distancing\nmeasures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.\nFollowing the moder ation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last\nyear, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak. Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.\nIn contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The housing sector has more\nthan fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing\nproduction have also picked up.\nThe overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to\nunprecedented fiscal and mone tary policy actions, which have provided essential support to\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities. The recovery has progressed more quickly than\ngenerally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised u p notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections. In commenting\non the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal policy.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently.\nEmployment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about\n\ntwo-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January. Nonetheless, employment in this\nsector is more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a\nwhole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre -pandemic level. The unemployment rate\nremains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment,\nparticularly as participat ion in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels.\nLooking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline;\nthe median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.\nOverall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer- run objective. Over the next few\nmonths, 12- month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and\nApril of last year fall out of the calculation. Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, part icularly\nif supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation. The median\ninflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 perc ent this year and declines to 2 percent next\nyear before moving back up by the end of 2023.\nThe Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibil ities to\npromote the financial— the stability of the financial system. As we say in our Statement on\n\nLonger -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-\nbased and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead\ndepends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and i nflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates,\nwe continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with th e\nCommittee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in\ninflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard.\nIn addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least\n$80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per\nmonth until substantial further progress has been ma de toward our maximum -employment and\nprice -stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased\nfinancial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment an d inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial\nfurther progress to be achieved.\nOur forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance,\nwill ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the\n\nbalance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Overall, our\ninterest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this diff icult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nJOE PAVEL. Howard from Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell, and , and thanks for that. So could you talk\nus through how the , the forecasts for 2021 map into the “ substantial further progress ”\ndefinition —you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I understand that ’s considered transitory. That still\nseems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment . Is it time to start talking about\ntalking about tapering yet ?\nCHAIR POWELL. [Laughter] Not yet. So, as you—as you pointed out, we ’ve said that\nwe would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress. So —and that ’s a difference from, from our past\napproach. So —and what we mean by that is , is pretty straightforward. It is , we want to see that ,\nthat the labor markets have moved —labor market conditions have moved —you know, have\nmade substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal. That ’s what we ’re going to want to see. Now, that\nobviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see—we ’ll be—we’ll be carefully\nlooking ahead.\n\nWe, we also understand that we , we will want to provide as much advance notice of any\npotential taper as possible. So when we see that we’ re on track, when we see actual data coming\nin that suggests that we ’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we ’ll say\nso. And we ’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots —why\nwouldn’ t that suggest a weakening of the commitment here ? An awful lot of people shifted into\n2022, it seems.\nCHAIR POWELL. I , I don’t see that at all. You know, we , we have a , a range of\nperspectives on the Committee. I welcome that. And, you know, we , we have —we debate\nthings, we d iscuss things, and we always come together around a —around a, a solution. But,\nyou know, the , the strong bulk of the Committee is , is not showing a rate increase during this\nforecast period. And, you know, as , as data improve, as the outlook improves ver y significantly\nsince the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up. It’ s probably not a\nsurprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.\nNonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee —the , the largest part by far of the\nCommittee is, is—doesn ’t show a rate increase during this period. And , again, part of that is\nwanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point. We do expect that we’ ll begin\nto make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year\ngoes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’ re\ngetting. We expect that to happen. But, you know, we ’ll have to see it first.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the supplementary\nleverage ratio. You know, there ’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this\n\nmonth, which—I ’m happy to hear an update if you have one. But just sort of more broadly, do\nyou think, long term , that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at\na time when the reserve supply is going to remain large ? And , if so, do you think the changes to\nthe leverage ratio , inclu ding the SLR , are the way to deal with that problem ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Victoria, we ’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.\nAnd I ’m not going to expound upon your questions. Why don’ t you—why don’t you ask\nanother question if you’ d like to ? Because, because that one —I’m just going to say that we ’ll\nhave something in coming days.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Sure. Okay. Well, then I ’ll ask about unemployment. You know,\nthere ’s—the unemployment rate is —you all have projections for the U -6 rate, but you ’ve also\nbeen, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that ’s not the only thing that you all are looking\nat. You ’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that. So are you all looking at\nways of maybe adding to how you’ re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of\nEconomic P rojections ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say, as we say in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals\nand M onetary P olicy S trategy, we look to a r ange of indicators on the labor market. We never\nonly looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of , of labor market outcomes\nthat’s in the SEP. We look at a very broad range. You hear us talk all the time about\nparticipation ; about em ployment to population, which is the combination of the two; about\ndifferent measures of, of unemployment. So it ’s wages, it ’s, it’s the job flows, it ’s, you know, all\nof those things . They go into an assessment —disparities of various groups . All that g oes into an\nassessment of maximum employment .\n\nThe, the —trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of E conomic P rojections\nwould not be practical . You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the\nunemployment rate , and that ’s a very insufficient statistic . So—it, it doesn’ t include a lot of\nother things that we —that we do look at . And I , I wouldn’ t want to say that we ’re looking to\ninclude the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP . But at time —from time to time, we\ndo look at , at adding different things . But I , I would just say the SEP is, it’s a summary . It’s one\ndevice . It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at . I think you know the things\nthat we look at —we, we talk about them all the time . So we ’re not actually looking actively at\nsignificantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast\noverall . You ’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have\ninflation —or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023,\nyet no rate hike in any of this —in any of this forecast horizon . So is this telling us that we could\nsee a higher inflation rate than was projected ? Or do you not —as you’ ve been talking about, is\nthe unemployment rate insufficient? Or what is this telling us about the Fed’ s reaction function,\nthat it seems you ’re meeting the Fed ’s dual mandate by 2023, yet , again , no rate hike expected ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I guess the first thing to say is that the , the SEP is not a\nCommittee forecast . It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve,\nand say , “This represent s our, you know, our reaction function as a C ommittee .” It’s a\ncompilation of projections from different people . And I —since we don ’t debate it or discuss it, it\nwould be hard for me to say why —exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.\n\nSo all I would say about this is that we ’ve—we laid out what I think is very clear\nguidance on liftoff . And it ’s really three things: labor market conditions that are consistent with\nour estimates of maximum employment—a nd, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of\nindicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate ; inflation that has\nreached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis ; and inflation that ’s on track to run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time . The fi rst two of those three are very much data\nbased; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it . So we are very\nmuch determined to implement this guidance in a robust way. It is the guidance that we chose\ncarefully to implement our new framework . And to meet these standards , we’ll need to see data,\nas I mentioned .\nSo what does —what does this, this SEP really say ? It says that we’ re committed to our\nframework and to the guidance we ’ve provided to implement that framework . We will wait until\nthe requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our\npolicy rate . And the last thing I ’ll say is this: The state of the economy in two or three years is\nhighly uncertain, a nd I woul dn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate\nincrease that far into the future . So that ’s how I would think about the, the SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Paul Kiernan .\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman Powell . My question is tw ofold. One, how\nhigh are you comfortable letting inflation rise ? There , there is some ambiguity in, in your new\ntarget, as you mentioned, “ expectations driven .” And, and do you think that that ambiguity\nmight cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby\ncausing financial conditions to tighten prematurely? Is that a concern ? Thanks .\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So we ’ve said we’ d like to see inflation run moderately above\n2 percent for some time . And we ’ve resisted, ba sically, generally, the temptation to try to\nquantify that . Part of that just is , talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation\nrun above 2 percent is the real thing. So I—you know, over the years we ’ve, we’ve talked about\n2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven ’t achieved it . So I , I would say we ’d like to, you\nknow, perform . That ’s what we ’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above\n2 percent .\nI don’ t want to be too specific about what tha t means, because I think it ’s hard to do that .\nAnd we haven’ t done it yet . You know, when we ’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that .\nI—look, I , I would say this . The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not\ngoing to act preemp tively based on forecasts for the most part . And we ’re going to wait to see\nactual data. And I think it will take people time to , to adjust to that —and to adjust to that new\npractice. And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it . So that ’s\nhow I would think about that .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Matthew Boesler .\nMATTHEW BOESLER . Hi, Chair Powell. This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg\nNews . So there ’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S . will reach herd immunity\nsometime this year . And all along, you’ ve said that the path of the economy is going to be\ndetermined by the course of the virus . I’m curious, based on the projections that you released\ntoday that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through\nthe end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be\ndoing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL . So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question\nto the experts . We don’ t control that. We’ re not responsible for defining it . And we ’ll, we’ll\nleave that whole discussion to the experts . I mean, we’re —what we ’re focused on is , is the part\nthat we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy. And there we ’ve provided\nvery clear guidance. And in the case of asset purchases, it ’s at their current level until we make\nsubstantial further progress . There is an element of j udgment in that , and we ’ll, we’ll—\ntherefore , we’ll supply clear communication well in advance of , of actually tapering, and we just\nwent through, you know, the , the criteria for raising interest rates . They ’re very specific. And,\nyou know, we ’re, we’re very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly.\nI, I would agree with you that the , the path of the virus continues to be very important .\nWe, we have these, you know, new strains with —which , which can be quite virulent . And we ’re\nnot actually done yet . And I, I —we ’re clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I\nmentioned, but we ’re not done . And I ’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we\nactually finish the job. So that ’s how I would look at that .\nMATTHEW BOESLER . If I could just briefly follow up , how do you see sort of the\ndisconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full\nemployment taking longer to achieve ? Is it , is it the case that factors related to the virus will still\nbe with us over the coming years ? Is that how to interpret the forecasts ?\nCHAIR POWELL . I think there ’s some of that . Sure, there ’ll be some of that. There\nwill still be some social distancing . People may be, for example, going in to spaces that, that , you\nknow, that involve close contact with others . Some people will do that right away. Others will\nhold back. And so I think there ’ll—there’ll be some of that .\n\nIn addition, though, remember, there are —there are 10 million people —in the range of\n10 million people who need to get back to work. And it ’s going to take some time for that to\nhappen. You know, it can—it can happen maybe , maybe more quickly than it has in the past,\nbecause it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating\naggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers . This could be a\ndifferent sort of a process . And it co uld be quicker . We don ’t know that . But it’ s, it’s just a lot\nof people who have —who need to get back to work. And it ’s not going to happen overnight . It\nwould be —it’s going to take some time . No matter how well the economy performs,\nunemployment will take quite a time to go —to go down, and so will participation. So that ’s all I\ncan say . I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later. We’d\nwelcome nothing more than that . But , realistically, given the numbers, it ’s going to take\nsome time .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you, Steve Liesman .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you. I wonder if you could—kind of a three -\nparter here, but all related . Would you comment on the current level of the 10- year yield and\nsome other lo ng rates out there , whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on\nthe economy? And , if not, is there a level that would give you concern? And, finally, the third\npart: Other central bankers have expressed concern about what ’s happened to yields in their\ncountries and even some taken action, but not you . Could you give us your general idea or\norientation towards the idea of , of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the\nbond market ? Do —do you like that idea ? Do you not like it ? Is it at the top of your toolbox, or\nis it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?\n\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure . So we m onitor a broad range of financial conditions , and\nwe’re always attentive to market developments, of course . We’re still a long way from our\ngoals , and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the\nachievement of those goa ls. And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what\nyou’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly\naccommodative . And that is appropriate . So that ’s, that’s how we look at it .\nI would add, as I ’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by\na persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals . We\nthink the stance of our —of monetary policy remains appropriate . Our guidance on the federal\nfunds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy. And we ’re\ncommitted to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and\ntruly done .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Could , could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that\ntool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating— doing an\nOperation T wist or something like that? Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox\nor something that you don’ t really prefer?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we —the tools we have are the tools we have. What I ’m\ntelling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe , is appropriate . We\nthink that our asset purchases in their current form —which is to say, you know, across the curve ,\n$80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage -backed securities on net —we think that that ’s,\nthat’s the right place for our asset purchases. Now , we can —we can change them, of course, in,\nin a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’ s appropriate . But , for now, we\nthink that our policy stance on that is appropriate .\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Rachel Siegel .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nYou’ve spoken about the pa ndemic ’s disproportionate toll on B lack Americans, Hispanic\nAmericans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market . And I ’m curious if you can\nspeak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have\npersistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans . And, relatedly, since\nyou’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower\nvaccination rates in communities of color? And what barriers do you think exist there? Thanks very much.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, which measures. So we, we do monitor and communicate very\nregularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let ’s say . So the African\nAmerican unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment\nrate. So we look at those and we see those as, you know —it’ s, it’s slack in the labor market.\nIt’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had real ly come down to record lows since we\nstarted keeping the data that way . As recently as a year ago , February of last year, we had those ,\nthose disparities quite low . What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the\nspeed of white unemploym ent. So we monitor those things .\nWe—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we ’re going to look at\nthose as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there ’s progress\nthere . And , and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on , on a part of the\neconomy that employs many minorities and lower -paid workers . The public -facing workers in\nthe service industries in many cases don ’t have a lot of financial assets , they’re not tremendously\nwell paid , they might have other jobs , and things like that . So this was a direct hit on that part of\n\nthe economy. And it ’s the slowest part of the economy to recover . So, you know, we ’d like to\nsee those people continue to get supported, you know, as we—as the br oader economy recovers,\nwhich , which it’ s very much doing now .\nIn terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s —those are facts and unfortunate facts.\nThey ’re really not something we , we have within our policy toolkit to address . But it is —it is\ntrue, though, that the data we have suggests that there are —there are significant disparities\nbetween different ethnic groups and —you know, but that ’s, that’s not for us . That ’s for fiscal\nauthorities and the government more generally to, to work on.\nMIC HELLE SMITH . Thank you. Jeanna Smialek .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell . Thanks for taking our questions . I was\nwondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come\ndown the line affecting the economy ’s potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you’ ve\ntalked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our , sort\nof, future prospects . And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse . You know,\nif we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to\navoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning. And I think that ’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the\nCARES Act and since then, has —is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full\nemployment . It’s going to make a huge difference in people ’s lives . And it has already.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks —opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we\nexpected . Part of that just is , it’s very hard to predict, given we ’ve never seen an event like this.\nBut part of it is just the strength of th e fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the\n\nyears. Longer term, you know, to, to really —that’s —the first part of it is about avoiding\nscarring, and I think we ’ve not avoided all of the scarring , but we ’ve probably avoided the worst\ncases there. And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course , to\ndo whatever we can to make sure that’s —that continues .\nLonger term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour\nworked, to rai se living standards over time, is investment : investment in people ’s skills and\naptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software . It takes a lot of investment\nto, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards . And t hat’s —you know,\nthat hasn’ t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly . And w e don’ t\nhave those tools . But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and\nbeginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal . But there should be a\nfocus on—a longer -term focus , I think , would be healthy on, on the investment front .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. James Politi .\nJAMES POLITI . Thank you, Chair Powell . I wanted to ask a question about the e uro\nzone . While the outlook for the U.S . economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has\nbeen far less encouraging . And it ’s showing signs of serious weakness due , due to the slower\nvaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions . How worried are you about\ntransatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that , that trouble in the e uro zone and\nweakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way , in the\naftermath of the financial crisis ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You ’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we ’re having\ndiverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis. And in this case, as well as the other\none, the U.S.’ s recovery is, is leading the global recovery. And, you know, we conduct policy,\n\nof course, here . Our , our focus is on —our, you know —our, our objectives are domestic ones.\nIt’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States . We monitor\ndevelopments abroad, and we know —because they know we know that they can —those can\naffect our outcomes . So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S . demand, if, if—as the economy\nimproves is going to support global activity as well over time . That, that ’ll be through imports .\nAnd, you know, when the U.S . economy is strong, that strength tends to be —tends to support\nglobal , global activity as well. So that ’s one thing.\nI don’ t—I don’t worry in the near term. I mean, I ’d love to see Europe growing faster .\nI’d love to see the vacci ne rollout going more smoothly. But I don’ t worry too much about us in\nthe near term, because we’ re, we’re on a very good track. Very strong fiscal support coming,\nnow vaccination going quickly, a nd cases coming down . I think we ’re—I think we’re in a good\nplace. It’s all ahead of us , but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain\nstrong for some time here .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions . I wanted to ask if the\nFed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases —\nI’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter , and if you’ re\nconsidering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests t hat were in place last year, this\nyear. And , kind of , what would make you consider doing something like that again?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we haven’ t made a decision on that . We’ re a couple weeks away\nfrom announcing that decision. I , I won’t foreshadow it here today. I will say , we’re going to\ncontinue our data -driven approach. You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends , so the\nfirms are preserving capital . Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital\n\nand their level of reserves. And the December stress test s showed that banks are strong and well\ncapitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we used in December, which were\nquite stringent .\nWe’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests , and we ’ll release those results before\nthe end of June . And that layer s, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress\nthe banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to\n11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent . So—but all of that, you know, the\nresults of the stress test s and the decision on distributions —all of that is to come fairly soon, as I\nmentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions . You laid\nout the standards to lift off. And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’ re not even\nthinking about thinking about raising rates . But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4\nnext year . How, how much debate —and how can you characterize that conversation —has there\nbeen about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, you know, it all depends . We’ ve set out very clear criteria for\nliftoff, right, where we’ ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with\nour estimates of, of maximum employment . And that doesn’ t just mean unemployment, it means\na much broader set of criteria . We want inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transitory basis . And\nwe want inflation on track to be moderately —to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .\nThose are the three conditions . Everybody on the C ommittee agrees to that, right?\nSo it comes down to, what ’s your projection for the economy ? If you want to—i f you\nwant to —you know, people will have a range of , of assessments for how good the economy is\n\ngoing to be . And, you know, we , we don’ t—I would say that we ’re in a relatively highly\nuncertain situation. If you look at the uncertainty, people , people on the Committee broadly say\nthat uncertainty about the forecast is , is very high compared to the normal level . We haven ’t\ncome out of a pandemic before . We haven ’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all\nup. So you’ re going to have differe nt perspectives from C ommittee participants about how fast\ngrowth will be, how fast the labor market will hea l, or how fast —sorry, inflation will move up.\nAnd those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff .\nOf course, thi s isn’t a decision to lift off now . We ’ll make that decision then . But it ’s an\nestimate based on —based on assumptions about growth. And it ’s, it’s meant to be a tool to\ngenerally show the public how , how our objective function works, how we think about the\nfuture . It isn ’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off. We—you\nknow, we ’re not going to make that decision for some time . The chances are that the economy in\nthat time and place will be very different from the one we think it ’ll be.\nSo I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they— they’re not a\nCommittee forecast . And you know this, but it’s—they’ re not a C ommittee forecast . It’s just\ncompiling t hese projections, really , of individual people . We think it serves a useful purpose .\nIt’s not meant to , to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the C ommittee will act.\nThat will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. We’ ll go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hey there, Chairman Powell . I wanted to elaborate a little bit on\nyour commentary about the fiscal stimulus . So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even\nmaybe mor e investment, at least from Congress , to support the more productive economy, as you\nanswer ed to Jeanna’s question. So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending. So where do\n\nyou see the fiscal space right now ? Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right\nnow where it wouldn’ t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, Brian, it ’s not up to us to decide what , what Congress should\nspend money on or when. I was answering Jeanna’s question, which r eally was, how do we\nassure lack of damage to —scarring , for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of\nthe economy? And I think what ’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that . But,\nreally, I wanted to make the longer -run point th at if—to work on the productivity—on\nproductivity over longer periods, that is—that is —comes down to a number of things . But one\nof those things is investment : investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of\nthose things .\nI’m not in an y way suggesting that that ’s something Congress should work on right now .\nOr that, you know, that ’s just not my—that’s not our job. I ’m just saying , that, that is what fiscal\npolicy can do that , really , monetary policy can’ t do—is, is invest in the future productive\ncapacity of the economy, raise potential growth . Those things are completely tools that Congress\nhas. And , again, I wasn ’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. N ext to Michael Derby .\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get your—an\nupdated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see\nany pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either , you know, specifically to\nthat, that area of the market or as in terms of, like , the threat that it could p ose to—propose to the\noverall economy.\nCHAIR POWELL . Sure. So, as you know, financial stability for us is , is a framework .\nIt’s not one thing. It ’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that. It’s a\n\nframework that we , we have . We report on it semiannually, t he Board gets a report on it\nquarterly, and we monitor every day. And it has —it has four pillars , and those are four key\nvulnerabilities: asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and\nleverage among financial institutions . Those four things . And I’ll just quickly touch on them .\nSo if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset\nvaluations are elevated compared to history. I think that’ s clear . In terms of households and\nbusinesses, households entered the , the crisis in very good shape by historical standards .\nLeverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the —since the financial crisis . Now, there was— there was some negative effects on\nthat, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing , but they ’ve also gotten a lot of support now . So\nthe damage hasn ’t been as , as bad as we thought . Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt\nload coming in. And —but —and many saw their revenues decline. But there’s— they’ve done so\nmuch financing, and there ’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet . So nothing in those two sectors\nreally jumps out as really troubling.\nShort term —I mentioned funding risk as the —as the last one. So we saw , again, in this\ncrisis, breakdowns in parts of the short -term funding markets —came under a tremendous amount\nof stress. And they’ ve been quiet since the spring . And , you know, we shut down our facilities\nand all of that. But we , we don’ t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just\nsaying again that we —that those —some aspects of the short -term funding markets and , more\nbroadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’ t hold up so well under great stress —under\ntremendous stress . And we need to go back and look at that . So a very high priority for us as\nregulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this , this will involve all the other\nregulatory agencies ; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those\n\nthings . So that ’s, that’s a—sort of a broader , detailed look.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Mr. Chair man, can you help me understand something about the ,\nthe SEP and your forecasts ? The inflation that you’ re talking about for this year , you say, is\n“transitory .” Then , by 2023, you’ re back down to 2.1 percent . There ’s no forecast for a rate\nincrease for 2023. If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or\n2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there —or, roughly zero\ngoing forward from there ? In other words, could we be in a Japan- like situation where rates just\nstay low because inflation does ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, again , I wouldn’ t read too much into, into the, the March 2021\nSEP dot plot . Remember what it is : It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual\nmembers . They ’re all making different assessments. They , they have different forecasts,\neconomic forecasts. Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic. And they’re —also\nremember that the SEP doesn ’t actually include all the things that go into maximum\nemployment . Right ? It’s, it’s only —it only includes unemployment .\nSo I, I would just say, we ’ve set out clear guidance . The —the message from the SEP that\nI would like to leave with people is , we set out clear guidance . I mentioned what it was . It’s\ninflation up t o—no, sorry, it ’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of\nmaximum employment —and that ’s not just unemployment, it ’s all the other indicators, but ,\noverall, totaling up to maximum employment ; it’s inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transient\nbasis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for —moderately for some time . Those are the\ncriteria . We ’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance .\n\nAnd that ’s what this —that’s what this says. T hat’s really all it says . We ’re going to wait\nuntil those requirements are met. And , again, you know, the , the state of the economy in two or\nthree years is highly uncertain . And I wouldn’ t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a\npotential rate increase that far in to the future .\nMICHAEL MCKEE . If I could follow up , I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would\nsay you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low . Now are you saying\nwe’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your goal on\nmaximum employment ?\nCHAIR POWELL . So what I would say is , we’re committed to giving the economy the\nsupport that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and\nprice stability . And, you know, to the extent having r ates low and support for monetary policy\nbroadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it ’s absolutely essential to maintain the\nstrength and stability of the —of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial\nstability quest ions if that ’s what you’ re getting at . You know, we , we do that . We wi ll—we\nmonitor them very carefully .\nI, I would point out that , over the long expansion —the longest in U.S . history, 10 years\nand 8 months —rates were very low for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years a nd then—and\nthen never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly. During that , we didn’ t see, actually ,\nexcess buildup of debt . We didn’ t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the\nprogress of the economy. We didn’ t see the things you—we didn’ t see a housing bubble . You\nknow, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn’ t see them build up despite very low rates . Part of that just is that you’ re in a low -\nrate environment, you ’re in a much lower rate environment , and the connection between low\n\nrates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is .\nThat’s not to say we ignore it . We don ’t ignore it. We, we watch it very carefully . And\nwe don’t think—we think there is a connection. We say there is, but it ’s not quite so clear . We\nactually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully. And we didn’ t do that\nbefore the Global F inancial C risis 12 years ago . Now we do . And we ’ve also, you know, put a\nlot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our\nfinancial system—are much stronger, much more resilient. That ’s true of the ban ks. I think it ’s\ntrue of the CCPs . We want it to be true of , of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets ,\nand, and institutions .\nSo I think that ’s, that’s —you know, monetary policy should be , to me , for, for achieving\nour macroeconomic aims . Fina ncial regulatory policy and supervision should be for\nstrengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of\nthings that it couldn’ t, frankly—a nd we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10. This time around, the\nregulated part of the financial system held up very well . We, we found some other areas that\nneed strengthening, and that ’s what we ’re working on now .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Anneken, CNN .\nANNEKEN TAPPE . Thanks for taking my question. Chair man Powell, could you talk\nto us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in , in inflation ? Does the former offset the latter to some degree ?\nCHAIR POWELL . I’m sorry, could you repeat that ? You broke up t here for a second .\nANNEKEN TAPPE . Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn’ t happen . Can you hear me now ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes, ye s.\n\nANNEKEN TAPPE . Okay, great . I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about\nthe relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in\ninflation . I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are\nmonitoring this .\nCHAIR POWELL . You ’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and\ninflation ? Is that— is that the question?\nANNEKEN TAPPE . Yes, exactly .\nCHAIR POWELL. Ok ay.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. If they offset each other— the persistent pandemic unemployment .\nCHAIR POWELL . Ye s, I think I ’m hearing you correctly. So I would say a couple\nthings . There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and\ninflation . That time is long gone . We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely\nlow. We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’ 19 and the beginning of ’20 without having\ntroubling inflation at all. We were at 3.5 percent . We were bouncing around with\nunemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent . And it wasn ’t just unemployment. Participation was\nhigh, wages were moving up. It was a very healthy thing. And we didn’ t see price inflation\nmove up.\nThere is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment . But that has not —\nwhat , what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have\nbeen absorbing that increase into their margins rather tha n raising prices . And that seems to be a\nfeature of late -cycle behavior . So we’re, we ’re not —when , when we —when we seek to achieve\nlow unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Going to Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Hi . Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit . I, I\nunderstand what you’ re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you ’re trying to send with\nthe dot plot . But does the same apply for the taper tantrum ? You’ve said that it ’s going to take\n“some time ” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “ some time”\ncould now be any time .\nCHAIR PO WELL. S o we ’ve said “substantial further progress .” Now, if you go back,\nOctober, November —sorry, November, December , and January, progress in the labor market\nslowed very sharply. So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month. If you go back and look\nat the , the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high. So we weren ’t\nmaking any progress on the labor market from November through January. February, we saw a\nnice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report —379,465 private sector . So that ’s good. It can go so\nmuch higher, though.\nAnd, and, you know, it would be nice to see —to really make faster progress that ’s\ndifferent from substantial progress , we’d like to see it be, be higher than that . And I think it will\nbe. That’s —the expectation is , you ’ll see now , I think , really strong job creation return —not as\nhigh as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but ,\nnonetheless, very stro ng.\nOkay . So what , what I’m saying is , to achieve substantial progress from where we are,\nhaving had three months of , of very little progress, is going to take some time . And it’s —we\ndon’t want to get into —I don’ t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace,\nbecause it ’s going to be data dependent . When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make\nsubstantial further progress, we ’re going to—we’re going to say so . We understand fully that\n\nthat test is one that involves judgment .\nIf you remember, during the G lobal F inancial C risis recovery, we said quantitative\neasing , number three , was —the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor\nmarket. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for\nthe labor market. It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that . This is just\nlike that, in a way . What we ’re saying is , substantial further progress toward our goals . We ’ll\ntell people when we think—until we —until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume\nwe’re not there yet. And as we approach it , well in advance —well in advance—we will give a\nsignal that , yes, we ’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering.\nSo that ’s, that’s how we ’re planning to handle it . It’s not different, really , from, from\nQE3. And I think we ’ve learned —what we ’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen\nyears is to communicate very carefully, very clearly , well in advance, and then follow through\nwith, with your communications . In this case, it ’s, it’s an outcome -based set of guidance, as our\nrate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy. That’s why it ’s not\nappropriate to star t pointing at dates yet .\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Don Lee , L.A. Times .\nDON LEE . Hi, Chair Powell. As you know, households , households are sitting on a lot\nof excess savings. And I wonder if , combined with that , you have an unl eashing of, you know,\npent-up demand. How much do you think that would affect —that would affect inflation ? And\nwould you expect that to be transitory?\nCHAIR POWELL . We, you know, we and everyone who’ s forecasting these—what ,\nwhat we’re all doing is , we are looking at the —at the amount of savings . We’re looking at —you\n\nknow, we have reasonably good data on that . And we ’re looking at the government transfers\nthat’ll be made as part of the various laws. And we ’re trying to make an assessment on what w ill\nbe the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume . And from\nthat, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and ,\nultimately , on inflation . So that ’s, that’s what we ’re all doing .\nAnd we have, you know, we have —we can look at history, and we can make estimates,\nand those are all very transparent and public . And you can compare one to the other . And, of\ncourse, we ’ve all —we’ve all done that . And I think we ’ve made very conservative assumptions\nand sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process. And what , what it comes\ndown to is what I said before, which is , there very likely will be a step -up in inflation as March\nand April of last year drop out of the 12- month window, because they were very low inflation\nnumbers . That ’s a— that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation . It’ll wear off quickly , though,\nbecause it —just the way the numbers are calculated .\nPast that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending mor e, and then, you know,\nyou can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner . And so —\nand they’ re not doing that now . They ’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters . That part\nof the economy—and travel and hotels —that part of the economy is , is really not functioning at ,\nat full capacity, right? But as that happens, people can start to spend . It’s also—wouldn’ t be\nsurprising if —and you’ re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there ’ll be\nbottlenecks. They won’ t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe , maybe for\na period. So those things could lead to—and we ’ve, we’ve modeled that . Other people have too.\nWe’ve—and w hat we see is relatively modest increases in inflation . So—but those are not\npermanent things .\n\nYou know, what ’ll, what’ll happen is —the supply side —the supply side in the United\nStates is very dynamic . People start businesses, they , they reopen restaurants, you know, the\nairlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen. And so it ’ll turn out to be a\none—a one -time sort of bulge in , in prices, but it won’ t change inflation going forward, because\ninflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent . We know that inflation dynamics\ndo evolve over time . And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.\nAnd, and that time is not now . That hasn ’t been the case for some decades. And we think it\nwon’t —it won’t—we won ’t suddenly change to another regime .\nThese things tend to change over time . And they tend to— tend to change when the\ncentral bank doesn ’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the\nkey to it all . The, the —having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ab ility to push\nhard when the economy ’s really weak . If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above\n2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that\ndidn’ t happen. We’ re committed to having inflation ex pectations anchored at 2 percent, not\nmaterially above or below 2 percent .\nSo that ’s—I think if you —if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that ’s,\nthat’s kind of what comes out of our assessment . There are different possibilities . I think it ’s,\nit’s a relatively unusual —very unusual situation to have all these savings and this , this amount of\nfiscal support and monetary policy support . Nonetheless, that , that is our most likely case . And\nyou know, as the —as the data come in and the economy performs , we’ll of course adjust . Our\noutcome -based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of\nthe economy is.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. We’ ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY . Thanks, Chairman Powell . My question is about those supply\nchain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side . Are they getting better , or are they getting\nworse ? We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we —that came\nout yesterda y. And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I have to say, I think it ’s impossible to say , frankly , with\nany confidence, but I , I would expect it ’s very possible —let’s put it that way —that you will see\nbottlenecks emerge and then clear over time. And you’ ll probably see that over a period of time,\nbecause, you know, really, the , the strong data are ahead of us . You know, you’re, you’re —right\nnow the, the checks are going out just , just now . And t hat’ll, that’ll add to spending. COVID\ncases are coming down . Vaccination is moving , now, quickly. You know, the , the really strong\neconomic data is coming . It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track. And that ’s when\nyou’ll really know where , where the bottlenecks are.\nBut you can see, though, that they’ re not —these are not permanent . It’s not like the\nsupply side will be unable to adapt to these things . It will—t he market will clear. It just may\ntake some time. And , and some of the answer to that may be price . In many cases, it won ’t be\nprice . You ’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices . You know, it ’s a little bit the story\nabout, you know, the wage —the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes\ndown, wages move up. But companies choose not to try to, to pass that , that price increase along\nto their customers . So you’ ll see a lot of that here too, I think . Anyway, we ’ll, we’ll see. But\nthat’s, that’s my basic , basic sense. Thank you very much.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you."
