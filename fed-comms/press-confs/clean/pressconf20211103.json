  "text": "November 3, 2021\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy\nhas made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases. With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery. Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the ful l range of plausible economic outcomes. I will say more about our monetary\npolicy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.\nEconomic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting\nprogress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support. In the third\nquarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace. The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by\nthe pandemic, including travel and leisure. Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry. As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter. None theless, aggregate demand has\nbeen very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. With COVID case counts receding further and\nprogress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong\ngrowth for the year as a whole.\n\nConditions in the labor market have continued to improve , and demand for workers\nremains very strong. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with\nthe rise in COVID cases. In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July. The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisu re and hospitality and\neducation.\nThe unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September . This figure understates the\nshortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued. Some of the softness in participation likely r eflects the aging of the population and retirements. But\nparticipation for prime -aged individuals also remains well below pre -pandemic levels —in part\nreflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus . As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings. These impediments\nto labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus —supporting gains\nin employment and economic activity.\nThe economic downturn has not fal len equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics.\nThe supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemi c and the reopening of the\neconomy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term. As a result , overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent\nlonger -run goal. Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.\nNonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly\n\nconnected to t he dislocations caused by the pandemic —specifically , the effects on supply and\ndemand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself.\nWe understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and familie s,\nparticularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and\ntransportation. Our tools cannot ease supply constraints. Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply an d demand imbalances and that , as\nit does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal. Of course, it\nis very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation. Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain.\nWe are committed to our longer -run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer -term\ninflation expectations well anchored at this goal. If we were to see si gns that the path of\ninflation, or [of] longer -term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently\nbeyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability. We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nLast December, th e Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace\nof at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our\n\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals. At today’s meeting, the Committee judged th at\nthe economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases.\nBeginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by\n$10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortga ge-backed securities. We\nalso announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-\nDecember, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year. That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And e ven after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities\nwill continue to support accommodative financial conditions.\nOur decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal\nregarding our interest rate policy . We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test\nfor the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -stability goal.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Hi. Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, the\nmarkets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year. Are they wrong?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say it this way. We try to focus on what we can\ncontrol —and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world,\nhow we ’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will\nevolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent , where the economy evolves in\nunexpected ways. So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising\nrates.\nIt is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further\nprogress toward our goals, measured from last December. We don’ t think it ’s time yet to raise\ninterest rates. There is still ground to cover to re ach maximum employment , both in terms of\nemployment and in terms of participation.\nGetting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and\nshortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that , as the\npandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up.\nAnd as that happens, inflation will decline from today’ s elevated levels. Of course, the timing of\nthat is highly uncertain. B ut, certainly , we should see inflation moving down by the second or\nthird quarter. The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on\nthe path of the economy.\nWe think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate. So, what I\nwill tell you is , we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with\nour expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that ’s what I would say.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Based on —if I could follow up, based on your c urrent outlook for\nthe labor market, do you think it ’s possible—or likely , even —that maximum employment could\nbe achieved by the second half of next year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at the progress that we ’ve made over the course of the\nlast year, if t hat pace were to continue, then the answer would be : “Y es, I do think that that is\npossible. ” Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but\nit’s certainly within the real m of possibility.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Next , we’ll go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you could detail a little bit\nhow you’ re thinking about wages at this moment. Obviously, we ’re seeing strong wage growth,\nparticularly for people in sort of lower- income fields. I wonder if you see that as a positive thing\nor as a potential start to a wage –price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two\nthings.\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly. A nd, in\nparticular, I would point to the e mployment c ompensation i ndex reading that we got last Friday.\nNow, in real terms, they ’ve been —they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real\nwages were not really increasi ng. I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not\nincreasing , but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase. So wages moving up, of\ncourse, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It’ s\nvery important, and it ’s generally a good thing. You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual\ncase where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and\nproductivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and\ncause companies to —or employers , really —to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself,\nfind yourself in what we used to call a wage –price spiral. We don’ t have evidence of that yet.\nProductivity has been very high. The ECI reading is just one reading. Again, if you look back,\n\nwe—so we ’ll be watching this carefully . But I would say that , at this point, we don’ t see\ntroubling increases in wages . And we don’ t expect those to emerge, but we’ ll be watching\ncarefully.\nJOE PAVEL. Next , we’ll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if you could perhaps give us\nyour thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. You talked about the\nshortfall of unemployment —reemployment relative to befo re the pandemic, and yet you have\ninflation, which is affecting everybody. Are we at , or close to , a point where the risk of inflation\nis greater than the benefit that you ’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now , from a risk -\nmanagement standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes? And k ind of a\nrelated question: T he statement today says you’ ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that\n2 percent inflation target. Our surveys show looking for 5 per cent inflation this year, 3 ½ percent\nnext year —it sure seems like you ’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent\ntarget. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So I ’m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would\nsay—in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Sure. The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and\nunemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find\nthese 5 million jobs again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher\ninflation —is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat\ninflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s, so, you know, this isn ’t the traditional Phillips curve situation\nwhere there ’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we ’re talking about. The inflation that\n\nwe’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It ’s due to bottlene cks, and it ’s due to\nshortages, and it ’s due to very strong demand meeting those. So I think it ’s not the classical\nsituation where you have that precise tradeoff.\nBut, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our S tatement o n Longer -Run\nGoals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is , we take into\naccount the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time\nhorizons over which employment and inflation are projected to retur n to levels judged consistent\nwith the mandate. So we used to call that the “ balanced approach ” paragraph . We have to think\nabout the amount of the deviation, w e have to think about the time it will take, and we have to\nmake policy in a world where the t wo goals are in tension. It’s very difficult.\nBut what it really boils down to is something that ’s common sense . And that is risk\nmanagement. We have to be aware of the risks that we’ re—particularly now the risk of\nsignificantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well\ninto next year. We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to —should it create a threat of more persistent, longer- term\ninflation . And that ’s what we think our policy is doing now. It’ s putting us in a position to be\nable to address the range of plausible outcomes.\nJOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next, we ’ll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times .\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that\nwould perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering ? And I’m wondering how you w ould also\ncharacterize the risks that the F ed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.\nThank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess , as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy\nperforms broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net\nasset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we ’re prepared to deviate from that\npath if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\nSo I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be. Of course, if we do\nsee something like that happening, if it b ecomes a question, then we ’ll communicate very\ntransparently and openly about that. But I ’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the\nstatement. Sorry, was there a second part?\nCOLBY SMITH. Ye s. It’s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have\nto do so later on.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here. We\nare prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it ’s warranted\nby changes in the economic outlook. And , again, if we feel like something like that ’s happening,\nthen we ’ll be very transparent about it. We wouldn’ t want to surprise markets. We ’ll say, in\nlight of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either d o it\nor not do it. But so —but I ’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that\nmight be today. Thanks.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you.\nJOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post .\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions.\nYou mentioned at the beginning that the F ed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses\nfor individuals and families, especially those with limited means. What is your message to t hose\n\nfamilies or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your\nexpectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So, first of all, it is our job to —and we accept responsibility\nand accountability for inflation in the medium term. We’ re accountable to Congress and to the\nAmerican people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we ’re also not at maximum\nemployment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.\nWe don’ t think it ’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the\nlabor market heal further . And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the\nDelta variant declines, s o—which it ’s doing now. So “ transitory ” is a word that people have had\ndifferent understandings of. For some, it carries a sense of “short lived, ” and that ’s, you know,\nthere ’s a real time component —measured in months, let ’s say. Really , for us, what “ transitory ”\nhas meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation. So that ’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “ transitory. ”\nWe said “expected to be transitory ,” first of all, to show u ncertainty around that —we’ve\nalways said that, by the way, in other context s; we just hadn ’t done it in the statement —but also\nto acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people. And then we added\nsome language to really explain more what we ’re talking about in paragraph two and\nparagraph three. We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the\nreopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said , “Progress on\nvaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in\n\neconomic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. ” So we ’re trying to\nexplain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory. ”\nSo it’s, I mean , it’s become a word that ’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is\ndistracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible. Ultimately, the only\nother thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it ’s particularly people who are\nliving paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs —when the\nwinter comes, higher heating costs for their homes. We understand completely what they’ re\ngoing through. A nd, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn ’t\nbecome a permanent feature of life. R eally , that’s one of our principal jobs, along with\nachieving maximum employment . And that ’s our commitment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber of t he Associated Press.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Well, I\nwonder if you could update us . You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could\nyou update how you define that? I mean , you’ ve, you know —a few months ago, yourself and\nother F ed officials talked about getting back to the pre -COVID labor market. There w ere even\nhints you might try to do something better than that. Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned,\npeople retiring, and there ’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of\nthat and other trends. You did mention the prime -age folks. So can you give us some examples\nof things you're looking at , specifically , to measure full employment ? Will you be looking at\nprime -age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to\npre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that\nwould work? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So maximum employment is, it ’s a broad —what would we\nsay?—broad -based and inclusive goal that ’s not directly measurable and changes over time due\nto various factors. You can’ t specify a specific goal. So it ’s taking into account quite a broad\nrange of things, and, of course, employment —levels of employment —[and] participation are a\npart of that. But , in addition, there are other measures of what ’s going on in the labor market,\nlike wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is —the level of quits , the amount of\njob openings , the flows in and out of various states. So we look at so many different things, and\nyou make an overall judgment.\nNow, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February\nof 2020 and say, well, that ’s the goal because we didn’ t know any—that ’s what we knew. We\nknew that w as achievable in a context of low inflation. I think we ’re in a, you know, we ’re\nlearning that. We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still\nvery, you know, COVID -affected, by the way. A lot of what we ’re seeing in the last 90 days is\nbecause of Delta. We were on a path to a very different place. Delta put us on a different path .\nAnd we see these things. But, so I think we ’re going to have to—ideally , we would have, we\nwould see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn ’t another COVID\nspike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot. We would see whether —how does\nparticipation react in that world, in that sor t of post -COVID world ?\nRight now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and]\nbecause of fear of COVID to a significant extent. You know, we thought that schools reopening\nand elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply. That doesn’ t seem to have been the case, interestingly. So I think there ’s room for a whole lot of\nhumility here , as we try to think about what maximum employment would be. We’ re going to\n\nhave to see some time post -COVID so that we know —or post -Delta, anyway —to see what is\npossible. And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that , over\ntime, you can get to places that didn’ t look possible.\nNow, what we also have now , though, is , we hav e high inflation. So we have a\ncompletely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that\nwith what ’s going on in the employment market. So it’s a complicated situation, and I would\nsay, we will, we hope to achieve signi ficantly greater clarity about where this economy is going\nand what the characteristics of the post -pandemic economy are over the first half of next year.\nJOE PAVEL. Thanks . We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, and thanks for doing this. So, give n that answer\nabout employment , I would like to get back to Steve ’s question a little bit. On a headline basis,\njust as it ’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?\nCHAIR P OWELL. Sorry, the two tests?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. The two tests in the state ment —the guidance that it has to hit\n2 percent and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent . Has the economy cleared that?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s a decision for the Committee . I would put it to you this way.\nWhen we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee ’s judgment, it ’s very possible that the inflation test\nwill already be met. We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with\nwhat ’s going on, but , you know, we ’re not at maximum employment. When that is the case,\nwe’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there ’s a good chance that it will be if you\nlook at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, to follow up, so you’ re not willing to commit that the\ncurrent levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately ” and “ for some time. ” So,\ngiven that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately ” over and “ for some time ” mean?\nCHAIR POWELL. What I ’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.\nYou know, we had the question on when to taper. We’ ve now answered that question and the\nspeed of i t and all that. We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test , because we\ndon’t meet the liftoff test now because we’ re not at maximum employment.\nWhat I ’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it ’s projected to be, let ’s say we\ndo mee t the maximum- employment test . Then the Committee —the question for the Committee\nat that time will be , has the inflation test been met ? And, you know, I don’ t want to get ahead of\nthe Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Y es, it ’s been met .” But we ’re not\nasking that question today, because we’ re not running a liftoff test. W e’re not evaluating the\nliftoff test today. We didn ’t have that discussion at today’s meeting. We did talk about the\neconomy and the development of the economy, but we didn’ t ask ourselves whether the liftoff\ntest is met, because, you know, it ’s clearly not met on the maximum -employment side.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi , Chair Powell. M atthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So,\nwhen you’ re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at\nmaximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent\nof what inflation is doing? And , if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of\nthe uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we ’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market ? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’ t actually define maximum employment as —we define it\nin terms of inflation, but , of course, there is a connection there. Maximum employment has to be\na level that is consistent with stable prices. But that ’s not really how we think about it. We think\nabout maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things. You can’ t just look at—\nunlike inflation, where you can have a number . But with maximum employment, you could be\nin a situation , hypothetically, w here the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people\nwho are out of the labor force and will come back in. And so you wouldn’ t really be at\nmaximum employment , because there’ s this group that isn ’t counted as unemployed.\nSo we look at a range of things. So the thing is , by many measures , we are at a very tight\nlabor market. I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things . Many of them are\nsignaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that? B ecause you have people\nwho are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’ re holding themselves out of\nthe labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID , or, for whatever\nreason, they ’re staying out. And it ’s clear th at there are, you know —with tremendous demand\nfor workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we ’re set up to go back to a higher job-\ncreation rate. So that would suggest that you’ re not at maximum employment. So, at the end of\nthe day, it is a judgme nt thing. But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of\nemployment that ’s consistent with price stability.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you’ve talked\na little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in tension and how you would have\nto balance those two things . Could you talk a little bit about what the F ed’s process for\nbalancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year , you decide there ’s a\nserious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. I mean, again, it ’s a risk -management thing. It ’s not —I can ’t\nreduce it to an equation, but , ultimately, it’ s about risk management. So you want to be in a\nposition to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case. And in this\ncase, the risk is skewed . For now , it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation. So w e need\nto be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be. So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it. And I think, though, that , judgmentally ,\ntoo, it ’s appropriate to be patient. It’s appropria te for us to see what the labor market and what\nthe economy look like when they heal further.\nWe know that we were on a path to a different place, a s I mentioned, when D elta arrived .\nAnd D elta stopped, it stopped job creation. It stopped that transitio n away from a goods -focused\neconomy where there ’s excess demand for goods because ther e—services are not available.\nPeople are not traveling. That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because ,\npresumably , people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel\nand all sorts of travel services and things like that.\nSo we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the\neconomy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation. Bottlenecks should be abating. We start to see that now with some of them, but , overall, they haven ’t gotten\nbetter overall, and, you know, we ’re very aware of that. So that ’s really how we ’re thinking\nabout it. We ’re thinking that time will tell us more. In the meantime, we don’ t think it’ s time to\nraise rates now. You know, if we do conclude that it ’s necessary to do so, then we ’ll be patient,\nbut we won’ t hesitate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Edwar d Lawrence at Fox Business.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call. So the Federal\nReserve—I want to talk about climate change . The Federal Reserve released a statement\ntoday—says “the Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential\nsolutions for the climate -related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory”\noutcomes. Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in,\nlike coal plants or fossil fu els?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That ’s\na decision for elected representatives. So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think\nwe have a role in climate change. It relates to our existing mandat es, and our existing mandates\nare, really , prudential regulation of financial institutions. We expect them , and the public will\nexpect us to expect them , to understand and be in a position to manage their risks. So that ’s\nphysical risk, and it ’s transition risk for climate . And, by the way, the large financial institutions\nare doing this already, and, you know, we think that ’s right within our mandate.\nThere ’s also a financial stability question , the overall stability of the financial system.\nAnd so, from that standpoint, we can do research. We can try to help understand what will the\npathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk . That ’s what we can do, and that ’s what we will do . And we ’ll do it well. W ithin\nthe frame of our existing mandates , we’ll do it well. We ’re not the people who will decide the\nnational strategy on climate change. That has to be elected people, and not so much us. We feel\nlike we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria Guida at Politico.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So the F ed recently announced that there is\ngoing to be new conflict -of-interest rules for investments by F ed officials, and this follows,\nobviously, the resignation of two regional F ed presidents. And I ’m just wondering, do you think\nthat there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the F ed, such as, you\nknow, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts? And also, if you could speak to\nwhether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by F ed officials. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, you know, we —let me just say that this system, the ethics\nsystem we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case. And so we had no moment of denial about that. As a\ngroup, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took. A nd, you know, wi thin one FOMC\ncycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is , we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’ re working in their\ninterest all the time —absolutely critical to our w ork, as it is for any government agency. A nd I\nfeel like this called that into question. So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and\nforcefully. If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them.\nSo you asked me about blind trusts. You know, the overall authority for ethics around\nthese issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE . And they have\na long- held position which is not favorable to blind trusts. They do not encourage them. They\ndon’t think they’ re effective. They think they ’re cumbersome . And they think there are better\nways to get at the things that need to be done . And those are the things that we ’re actually doing.\nSo I don’ t know that there are any blind trusts , for that reason, because they are the, they ’re the\nregulator . They say this on their website , if you look. In terms of laws broken, you know, I\n\nasked the inspector g eneral to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there\nwere laws broken, and I won’ t speculate on that . But that is with the i nspector g eneral now and,\nof course, out of my hands.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that , given\nthe long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given\ninflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore ,\nsend the economy into recession. Given the fact that , basically , your forecast has been chasing\ninflation over the last year, and now you’ re talking about it not coming down until the second or\nthird quarter , why would they be wrong in thinking that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, let me say what ’s hap pened— and we ’re very, very\nstraightforward about it —is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have\nbeen more persistent and more prevalent. We see that just like everybody else does, and we see\nthat they ’re now on track to persis t well into next year. That was not expected —not expected by\nus, not expected by other macro forecasters.\nNow, let me say, you know, it ’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal\ntimes. When you’ re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it ’s a whole\ndifferent thing . And you’ re talking about a pandemic that ’s holding people out of the labor force\nfor reasons that we can sample, but we don’ t have a lot of experience with this . So it’s very,\nvery difficult to forecast an d not easy to set policy. So we have to set policy, though. So that ’s\nwhat we ’re doing.\nAnd, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’ t think that we ’re behind the\ncurve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible\n\noutcomes, and that ’s what we need to do. I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.\nThat’s not —I don’ t think that ’s controversial. Certainly, I don ’t know anyone arguing for that\ntoday. A nd the r eason is that there ’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment . And\nwe don’ t want to stop that when there ’s good reason to think —there ’s still good reason to think,\nalthough it ’s been delayed, clearly, there ’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen,\nparticularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID . That’s when we ’re\nreally going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.\nAnd, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we ’re seeing in global supply\nchains around goods and, frankly , now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger\nthan the capacity of those ports —those things are going to work themselves out. We have a\nflexible economy. It ’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed\nto create a vaccine faster than, certainly , than I expected. A nd I think this stuff will work itself\nout over the course of next year. That is my baseline understanding, and that ’s a very widely\nheld one among people.\nBut, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to\nachieve price stability and maximum employment . And we ’re going to let the data lead us to\nwhere we need to go. Our policy will adapt —and has already adapted —to the changing\nunderstanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply- side story —which is also\npartly a demand story. So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our question s.\nSo you announced that the F ed is going to taper at a rate of , starting at $15 billion a month, and\nthat’s more than twice the pace of the last taper. So why are you tapering faster this time?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back\nin, I guess it was , 2013. We were much farther away from maximum employment. Inflation\nwas much lower. This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job\nopenings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people. So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013 , where we still had quite a ways to go. I mean , after we\nbegan that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as\nconditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability.\nSo this is quite a different situation, and , you know, the C ommittee unanimously felt\ntoday that we had met the test that we ’d articulated, and this was appropriate . And this is faster\nthan, you know, than what people had expected six months ago. It’ s earlier and faster, and that ’s\nbecause our, as I mentioned, ou r policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it ’s\nclarifying itself, and that ’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher —so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Mike Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yes, thank you for taking my questi on. I wonder if the F ed has\ngiven any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down? And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into\nwhat F ed bond buying actually does for the economy? I n terms of its economic impact, have\nyou been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I ’m sure\nyou know there ’s often been questions about , what is bond buying actually doing to help the\neconomy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you\nmention—we haven ’t gone back to them. Now that we ’ve tapered, I expect that that ’s exactly\n\nwhat we ’ll do in coming meetings . And we ’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we ’ll talk about\nreinvestment and all those things. And w e don’ t have to make decisions on those yet . But, you\nknow, typically, when we ’re doing a new subject like that, we ’ll have a series of briefings and\ndiscussions . And that ’s what we will now begin to do.\nIn terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’ s a tremendous amount\nof research and scholarship on this . And, you know, you can kind of —you can find different\npeople coming out with different views . But I would say, the most mainstream view would be\nthat you ’re at the effective lower bound, so how do you a ffect longer -term rates? There are two\nways. One, so you can’ t low er rates —let ’s say you can ’t lower rates any further, hypothetically.\nSo you can give forward guidance. You can say, we ’re going to keep the rates low for a period\nof time, either [for] a specific period , [or] until certain conditions are met. The marke ts will do\nthe math, and that ’ll have an effect on longer -term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out\nkind of thing. So that ’s one thing. The other thing you can do is , you just go buy those\nsecurities, buy longer -term securities. That will drive d own longer -term rates and hold them\nlower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.\nSo lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People —you can\nservice your debt. You have more free cash flow. You know, it ’s not different from what we do\nat the short end. So that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was —I think Milton\nFriedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many,\nmany years ago.\nSo, anyway, that ’s how it ’s supposed to work. A nd, you know, it ’s quite hard to be\nprecise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’ t run\ntwo different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. B ut most people\n\nfind—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would\nexpect, whic h is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we\ndo what we do. More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity , over\ntime, with a lag . So I think that ’s the main finding I would say on QE .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ re going to go to Paul La monica at CNN.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you’ ve addressed already questions\nabout the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional F ed presidents and , you\nknow, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the F ed. I was\nwondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own\nfuture, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say—to the President and to s enators that , potentially, you know, will be voting on a\nrenomination—about this , specifically with regards to your future as F ed Chair for a possible\nsecond term?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m not going to—I won ’t have any —I will answer your question,\nPaul, but I ’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Fair enough.\nCHAIR POWELL. I will say, though, that I have briefed A dministration officials, and\nI’ve briefed people on Capit ol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it , and seeking\ntheir feedback, getting their reaction . But, you know, this is —part of my job is —Congress has\noversight over the F ed, and we take that very seriously. So if you’ re on our, one of the two\ncommittees that has oversight over us, then I ’m in regular contact with you , probably. A nd, you\nknow, when something like this comes up, I ’m on the phone. I ’m offering to meet with you and\nexplain it to you and answer your questions and identify any conc erns people might have. That ’s\n\njust part of my job. So I do that. I don’ t talk about particular conversations . But you can\nassume I ’ll always do that . And I certainly did it in this case.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio. Is the\nFed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned\nare you, ultimately , about banks ’ willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a\npermanent fix?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’ t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right\nnow. We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that\nchannel. We ’re also —we also have a—there ’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about,\nover T reasury [securities] markets , and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic , and\nwhat structural things may need to be done. So that would be part of that workstream, and I\nknow that there ’s a lot going on. I ’m not sure when that report will be out.\nSo it’s work under way. That ’s one of the many issues that are part of that , along with\nthings like central clearing of T reasuries, great er central clearing, and , you know, many other\nideas. It ’s important that we have a liquid T reasury [securities] market. It’s a huge public\nbenefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know,\nwhile also assur ing the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be\nthe main dealers. So we have to make sure that that ’s always a first order of concern as well.\nHANNAH LANG. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.\n\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. So, just to\nexpand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill\nand in the A dministration . You talked about what you’ ve done already, but I ’m just wondering\nif you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that , either from the public ’s view or from the financial community ’s view of the\nFederal Reserve’ s independence . And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode\nand have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened?\nCHAIR POWELL You know, I think it ’s too soon to say what the reputational damage\nis. I think , from the very beginning, my reaction was : We need to deal with this\nstraightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully. And that ’s what we ’re going to do. I mean , it’s,\nit means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this\nhappens again, and I like to think we ’ve made a real good start on that. If you think about it, you\ncannot execute a trade unless it ’s precleared, and then you have to say, “E xecute. ” It’s not even\na trade. Really, there ’s no trading going on. This is for investment and, you know, getting\nliquidity for life ’s expenses. But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or\npurchase. So I think it ’s a pretty good system. We’ll always be looking to make it better.\nSo in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think\nwe have . And I like to think it ’s enough, but it ’s going to, you know —we ’re just beginning to\nimplement it. We have to write the rules, which we’ re doing, you know, as quickly as possible.\nWe need more people. We’re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the\nBoard, and also, we ’re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the F ed has\nmore than —the S ystem has more th an 30,000 employees. Not all of them, far few of them, will\n\nbe covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this , will, you know, will have\nto have technology access, and it ’s going to have to work efficiently. So there ’s a lot of work to\ndo to implement.\nYou know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades . And it was\nin place when I took over. It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four C hairs . And,\nyou know, it was what it was . And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it. And part of\nthat was, it wasn ’t uniformly enforced across the System. I’m a big believer in the value of the\nFederal Reserve S ystem and the Reserve Banks . But you had 12 different ethics officers at\n12 different Banks. And you had ethics people here . And, you know, compliance wasn’ t, it\nwasn ’t all exactly the same. It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were—\nyou know, we didn’ t imagine the problems that happened. And they may have actually been—I\ndon’t know this —but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.\nThey were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said , don ’t do anything that\nwould create that appearance. I mean , that ’s clear . This was a bad appearance.\nSo, anyway, what can we do? We are where we are. It happened, and we just have to\ndeal with it forthrightly and transparently and “ own” it and step up to this, you know, meet this\nmoment. I ’m totally committed to doing that. A nd, again, if there are better ideas, I ’d love to\nhear them, but I think we have so far made a good start.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. When you say you spoke with A dministration officials, did that\ninclude the President?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all. I just, I’ m not going to\ngive you any names, so don’ t take that as a “yes” or “no.” I’m just not going to start down that\nroad.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. T hank you. We’ re going to go to Jeff Cox for the last\nquestion.\nJEFF COX. Yes, thank you. Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment.\nWe’ve seen what ’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers.\nIs there any feel ing there that maybe you’ ve been accused of “fighting the last war ”—that\nperhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post -COVID environment and that full\nemployment may not look like what it looked like before?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So, what ’s happening is , people are leaving their jobs. They ’re\nquitting their jobs in all -time-high numbers —but , in many cases, going back into employment\nand getting higher wages. So a lot of the higher wages you’ re seeing are for job switchers rather\nthan incumbents. So that’s just, that ’s a sign of a really strong labor market , as opposed to\npeople just running off and quitting. There have also been —there are a significant number of\nretirements, and we ’ll just have to see what that means.\nSo, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic\nhistory, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was\nthe trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire. So maybe this was just catch -up on that. I am a believer that , over\ntime, you won’ t know how far —you won’ t know what can happen with labor force participation\nin advance. You’re just going to have t o give it some time, because we saw that over and over\nagain.\nThere are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is.\nLabor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be\n\nhumble about what the limits are of labor force participation. But we expect labor force\nparticipation to pick up. We don’ t know the pace at which it will do so.\nSo in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think , at the very beginning of the\nrecove ry, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in\nFebruary of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. There was so much to like\nabout that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor\nmarket.\nWe’re in a different world now. This is a —it’s just very different. The pandemic\nrecession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest. And wages didn’ t really go\ndown. And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support] .\nAll of this is completely unusual. You know, an economy w here inflation was driven by services\nis now inflation where —all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a\nquarter -century.\nSo you ask about full employment . I think we have to—I ’m very open to the thought that\nit’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we ’re just going to learn more\nand more. I mean , one thing we ’ll learn, I think, I hope we ’ll learn in the next, in the near term\nis, once the D elta variant really does continue to decline, what’ s going to happen to\nemployment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again? If you look back, the three -, six-, and nine -month average job creation is between\n550,000 and 600,000. So if you think of that as a stronger —you don’ t have to think back to the\nmillion -job months of June and July. You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get\nback on t hat path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to s ee that, of course. So\n\nwe’ll know so much more . And, believe me, we understand. It’s a different world in so many\nways . And we ’re very open to that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you."
