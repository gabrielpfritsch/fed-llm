  "text": "June 14, 2017\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Before I get started, I just want to say that our\nthoughts are with those who were injured this morning.\nToday the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the\nfederal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1 to 1¼ percent. Our decision to make\nanother gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the progress the economy has made, and is expected to make, toward maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law.\nWe also released today, as an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and\nPlans, additional information on the pr ocess that we will follow in normalizing the size of our\nbalance sheet once we determine that it is appropriate to begin doing so. I ’ll have more to say\nabout our interest rate decision and our balance sheet policy, but first I ’ll review recent economic\ndevelopments and the outlook.\nFollowing a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded,\nresulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year. Household spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been support ed by solid fundamentals, including ongoing\nimprovement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth. Business investment, which was weak for much of last year, has continued to expand. And exports have shown greater stre ngth this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth.\nOverall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.\nIn the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of\nthe year —a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above\n\nestimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment\nrate has fallen about ½ percentage point since the beginning of the year and was 4.3 percent in May, a low level by historical standards and modestly below the median of FOMC participants ’\nestimates of its longer -run normal level. Broader measures of labor market utilization have also\nimproved this year. Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years. Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market. Looking ahead, w e expect that the job market will strengthen\nsomewhat further.\nTurning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures was 1.7 percent in April, up from less than 1 percent last summer but down somewhat over the past few months. Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and\nenergy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has also edged lower. The recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appear to be one -\noff reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs. These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12 -month inflation figures\nuntil the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation. However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 per cent over the next\ncouple of years, in line with our longer -run objective. Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent\ninflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\nLet me now turn to the economic projections that Committe e participants submitted for\nthis meeting. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views\n\nof appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of the\nmany factors that shape the outlo ok. The median projection for growth of inflation- adjusted\ngross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.2 percent this year and edges down to 1.9 percent by\n2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate. The median projection for the unemployment\nrate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018\nand 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate. Finally, the median\ninflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 per cent in 2018 and 2019. Compared\nwith the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moder ately lower path, and inflation—alt hough marked down this year for reasons I\nmentioned earlier —is unchanged over the following two years. In addition, the median estimate\nof the longer -run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent.\nReturning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually\nincreasing its target range for th e federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make\nprogress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. Our decision today continues this process.\nWe continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around\nour 2 percent longer -run objective. That ’s based on our view that the federal funds rate remains\nsomewhat below its neutral level —that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much furth er to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also expect the neutral\nlevel of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely\n\nto be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion. Even so, the\nCommittee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is\nlikely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\nThis view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, about in line with its estimated longer -\nrun value. Compared with the projections made in March, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged.\nAs always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their\nassessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes t o their\neconomic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks. As I ’ve noted previously, policy is\nnot on a preset course.\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. As I noted in our policy statement, we are\ncontinuing to maintain the size of our balanc e sheet by reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.\nProvided that the economy evolves broadly as the Committee anticipates, we currently expect to\nbegin implementing a b alance sheet normalization program this year. Consistent with the\nprinciples and plans we released in 2014, this program would gradually decrease our\nreinvestments and initiate a gradual and largely predictable decline in our securities holdings.\nThe adde ndum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that we released today\nprovides further information. For both Treasury and agency securities, we will reinvest proceeds\nfrom our holdings only to the extent that they exc eed gradually rising caps on the reductions in\nour securities holdings. Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels —$6 billion per\n\nmonth for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies. So, any proceeds exceeding those\namounts would be reinvested. These caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to\nmaximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency\nsecurities and will remain in place through the normalization process. By limiting the volume of\nsecurities that private inve stors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should\nguard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains.\nAs I previously noted, when our securities holdings begin to gradually decline, so too will\nthe supply of reserve balances in the banking system. At some point, probably a few years down\nthe road, the Committee will bring the decline in our balance sheet to an end as the quantity of\nreserves is normalized. I can ’t tell you what the longer -run normal level of reserve balances will\nbe because that will depend on the Committee ’s eventual decisions about how to implement\nmonetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as -yet\nunknown elements, including the banking syst em’s future demand for reserves and various\nfactors that may affect the daily supply of reserves. What I can tell you is that we anticipate\nreducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in\nrecent years but larger than before the financial crisis.\nAs readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed\npotential long -run frameworks for implementing monetary policy. Decisions about the\nappropriate long -run framework do not need to be made for quite some time, and our future\ndeliberations will benefit from the experience we will gain during the normalization process. At\nthis point, I ’ll just point out that our current system is working well and has some important\nadvantages. In parti cular, it is simple and efficient to operate, does not require active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves, and, most importantly, provides good control over the\n\nfederal funds rate and effective transmission of changes in the federal funds rate to broader\nmoney market rates. And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller\nquantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the\nCommittee ’s future options for how to implement monetary policy.\nFinally, as noted in today ’s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target\nrange for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.\nIn other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in\nnormal times. However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material\ndeterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds\nrate. More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including\naltering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to\nwarrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the\nfederal funds rate.\nThank you. I ’ll now be happy to take your questions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, the\nprinciples you released today say the balance sheet wind -down should commence once interest\nrate normalization is “ well under way.” With this latest rate increase, do you believe\nnormalization is now well under way?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So that is something that we ’ve said for some time , and I ’ve\npreviously —when I ’ve been asked what “ well under way ” means —said that I don ’t want to\ndefine that in purely quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms. So there ’s no specific\nlevel of the federal funds rate that means we’ re well under way. But it’ s also a question of not\nonly the current level , but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of\n\nthe federal funds rate. So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times. Our\noutlook is that we anticipate further increases this year and next year for the federal funds rate ,\nand our statement indicates that if the economy continues to evolve in the manner that we expect ,\nthat we would feel the conditions are in —will be in place to begin this process this year.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Madam Chair, I ’m wondering if you’ ve\ntalked to the P resident or members of his staff about th e possibility of staying on as C hair for a\nsecond term. I’m also wondering if you would consider doing that —that ’s something you\nthought about doing. And , finally, the re are three vacancies on the F ed. Have you —do you have\nany comment at all for the P resident about his failure to nominate anybody for those three\npositions? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So what I ’ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve\nout my term as C hair, which ends in early February. I have not had conversations with the\nPresident about future plans. And I do very much hope —I know that they have been working\nhard to identify appropriate nominees for the open slots , and I do very much hope that there will\nbe nominations in the not -too-distant future , and that the Senate will take those up expeditiously.\nI look forward to having a full B oard.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. And , I’m sorry, just to follow up: Do you desire to stay on?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I really don ’t have anything for you at this point.\nSAM FLEMING. Thank s very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . We ’ve\nnow had a very long streak of —or fairly long streak of wea k inflation numbers , at least measured\nby the CPI th is morning as well. Marketplace -based inflation expectations are declining. What\nkind of vigilance are you now saying is needed in terms of wea k inflation? How does that\ninteract with your policy outlook? And would further disappointments argue for pressing\n\n“pause ” on rate hikes or delay ing balance sheet runoff? How do you think about thos e two\npotential responses to wea k inflation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me just say , as I emphasized in my statement and always say ,\nmone tory policy is not on a preset course. We indicated in our statement today that we ’re\nclosely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there\nhave been several weak readings , particular ly on core inflation. Our statement indicates that we\nexpect inflation to remain low in the near te rm. But , on the other hand, we continue to feel that\nwith a strong labor market and a labor market that ’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are\nin place for inflation to move up. Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully and\nensure , especially with roughly five years o f inflation running under our 2 percent objective —\nthat is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed. And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation , and I pledge that we\nwill do that.\nBut let me say , with respect to recent readings, i t’s important not to overreact to a few\nreadings , and data on inflation can be noisy. As I pointed out, there have been some\nidiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a huge\ndecline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs. We had an\nexceptionally low reading on core PC E in March, and that will continue to hold down 12- month\nchanges until that reading drops out. But we are —this morning ’s reading on the CPI showed\nweakness in a number of categories , and it ’s certainly something that we will be closely\nmonitoring in the months ahead. We will—we ’re focused on making our policy decisions on the\nmedium -term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, a s\nalways , revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate.\n\nSAM FLEMING. Any implications for beginning of runoff and further increases in the\nfed funds rate?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So —continue , as today ’s actions show , to feel that the economy is\ndoing well, is showing resilience . We hav e a very strong labor market, an un employment rate\nthat’s declined to levels we ha ve not seen since 2001. And , even with some modera tion in the\npace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains —\nremains accommodative. So, I —it’ s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective ,\nas our projections show we cont inue to expect that and be lieve the conditions are in place. But\nwe will monitor incoming data , obviously , and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems\nappropriate.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Hate to belabor the point on\ninflation, but I was wondering, I hear a lot of the so- called NAIRU in your conversation now and\nin other committee members ’. It’s an unobservable thing. At best, it’ s an estimate. And the\nassumptions in there seem to me that the economy today is much like the economy yeste rday,\nwhen , if anything , we’ve learned that the post -recession economy is vastly different than it was\nbefore the recession. So I ’m wondering , something you’ ve talked about i s to focus more on the\nchange in inflation —actual inflation , and is it going up or is it going down , and basing policy\nmore on that. What would be the risk of that , and why not adopt that if you have such a long\nperiod of underperformance ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation\nand altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.\nAnd, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment ,\nand there ’s a great deal of uncertainty about it , and it ’s hard to pin down, especially given the\n\nfact that the so -called Phillips curve appears to be quite flat. That means that inflation doesn ’t\nrespond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment. Nevertheless, that\nrelationship , I believe, remain s at work. We have seen that operate historically. Now, in the face\nof very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low , and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors , but we certainly\nhaven ’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation. In light of that, the C ommittee\nhas successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer -run rate of unemployment , and in\nthis projection, it’ s moved down to 4.6 percent , a tenth lower than it was last time. So, while the\nunemployment rate is below that, it’ s not that much—it’ s not that much below it.\nANA SWANSON. Ana Swanson, t he Washington Post . We saw measures of consumer\nand business confidence rise after inauguration on expectations tha t the A dministration would\nmove quickly to introduce policy changes like tax cuts and infrastructure spending. But some of\nthose policy changes have been slower to materialize than initially expected. How do you view the positive and negative risks from policy changes to your outlook, and has your view changed\non that at all i n the last six months ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite\nstrong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the expected policy\nchanges , such as changes to tax policy or fiscal policy more generally. I would say that , based\non my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts , that I haven ’t seen very much evidence that , thus far , expectations of policy changes\nhave driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending. So I really wouldn’ t expect any significant pullback . Many of our business contacts —I think their\n\nconfidence remains high. They ’ve not really changed their plans yet , and they have a wait -and-\nsee attitude.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . Measures of\nfinancial cond itions show that since the F ed started raising interest rates two years ago, financial\ncondi tions actually have loosened. Consumer business borrowing costs in many cases are down.\nDo you have the sense that the market is not listening to you? How much of a concern is that for\nyou? And , at some point, does it convince you that you need to rais e rates perhaps more\nquickly?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many\ndifferent factors into account. We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year. That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions. There’ s been a modest decrease\nrecently in the value of the dollar , although it ’s up substantially since mid -2014. So we take\nthose factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.\nWe have done that , and —but other things also affect the stance of policy. So there really can ’t\nbe any simple relationship. We ’re not targetin g financial conditions. We ’re trying to set a path\nof the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don’ t show up in a\nfinancial conditions index. We’re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that\nmeet our man dated objectives.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, on inflation again, I just\nwonder, what ’s the possibility that something more , sort of —I mean , nefarious is at work here,\nright, which is that the , sort of , weight of central bank credibility now —for a generation , really —\nplus globalization has just pushed the world into a low -inflation environment that ’s going to be\n\nvery hard to get wages and prices moving again. And then, related to that, you know, if NAIRU\nis 4.2, why not 4 or why not 3.8? You banked a quarter —you know, a full percentage point now ,\nso you’ re probably at less risk of falling behind whatever curve exists. Why rush?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I don’ t think central bank credibility —at least the F ed’s\ncredibility —has been impaired. We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation\nexpectations . Professional forecasters —whether it ’s in the B lue Chip or the S urvey of\nProfessional F orecasters, those expectations have remained quite steady and in close alignment\nwith our 2 percent inflation target. TIPS -based measures of inflation compensation do not\nprovide straight reads on market participants ’ estimates and expectations about inflation. They\nembody other elements —risk premia and liquidity premia as well. They had moved down and\nnow have moved—they remain at low levels , but they have moved back up again. It is true that\nsome household surveys of inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’ t say\nthat we ’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expect ations.\nBut you asked also, I guess , about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation\nprocess , and that certainly is possible. And estimates of the normal longer -run unemployment\nrate—they are quite uncertain. I agree with your assessment there. We ’re really not certain what\nthey are. And policy is not being —is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.\nWe’re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs. And, you know, I continue to\nbelieve, though, that with job growth running well in excess , even with the moderation of the\nlevel that ’s needed to provide for new entrants in the labor market, we do have a strengthening\neconomy . With policy accommodative , all that we ’re doin g in raising rates is moving —\nremoving a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace. And I see that a s appropriate.\nWe’re not moving so aggressively as to put a br ake on continued improvement in the labor\n\nmarket. But I think that that ’s a prudent move , to move in a gradual way to remove\naccommodation , with unemplo yment now —and not only , I should say , the unemployment rate ,\nbut I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at ,\nwhether it ’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring\nworkers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings , all of these\nindicators do signal a tight labor mar ket.\nNow, with inflation below 2 percent , I think it’ s appropriate that the labor market be that\ntight. But , on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk. We want to keep the expansion\non a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need—we find ourselves in a\nsituation where we ’ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a\nrecession. So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the C ommittee believes , is an appropriate\nmanagement of risks. But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , that we ’ve faced that situation now for a long time , and it’ s really quite\nessential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective , and it ’s a symmetric objective. So that ’s a risk that we face as well. The C ommittee\nbelieves we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that ’s also a risk . And those\nthings point , I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.\nRecently, a group of economists sent the F ed a letter earlier this month disagreeing with your\n2 percent inflation target and saying they would like the economy to run a bit hotter. They don ’t\nthink the labor market is so tight. You say you ’re committed to the 2 percent target, but what do\nyou say to them?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, at the time that we adopted the 2 percent target —it was back in\n2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation\nobjective should be. And, you know, I believe that was a well -thought -out decision. Now, at the\nmoment, we are highly foc used on trying to achieve our 2 percent objective. And we recognize\nthe fact that inflation has been running below , and it ’s essential for us to move inflation back to\nthat objective.\nNow, we ’ve learned a lot in the meantime , and assessments of the level of the neutral\nlikely level , currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are\nquite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years. And that means that the economy is —\nhas the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective. So it ’s that recognition that causes\npeople to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that ’s an important\nset—this is one of our most critical decision s and one we are attentive to evidence and outside\nthinking. It’s one that we will be reconsidering at some future time. And it ’s important for our\ndecisions to be informed by a wide range of views and research which is ongoing inside and\noutside the F ed. But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of\nbenefits of a higher in— potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential cost s\nthat could be associated with it. It needs to be a balanced assessment. But I would say that this\nis one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future , and\nwe very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this.\nDON LEE . Thank you. Don Lee with the L .A. Times . The F ed’s projections continue to\nshow the longer -run federal funds rate at 3 percent. The markets are expecting 2 percent . How\n\nbig of a concern is that gap in your mind? What are the reasons for the disconnect? And, you\nknow, what are the implications and the risks for the real economy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me first say , it’s not straightforward to determine exactly what\nexpectations are embodied in market prices because there are t erm premia that affect these rates ,\nand they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read. That said, in part,\nexpectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it ’s likely to\nevolve over time. And views have changed about that over time , and there is a good deal of\nuncertainty about it. So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range of\nuncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.\nThere’ s a good deal of uncertainty and—tha t reflects the, like —all the shocks that can affect the\nevolution of the economy , and also the fact, we ’re quite uncertain ourselves about what the\nlikely —what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate.\nSo we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current\nexpectations. And the median now stands at around 3 percent , but we have uncertainty about\nthat. Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is lower than that. And as\nI said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years. But that remains uncertain , and I think that ’s\nsomething that market participants are trying to assess , and we will be as well.\nDON LEE . But do you see greater volatility in the markets as it adjust s to the difference\nin the gap between the expectation and what the F ed’s projections are for the longer -run federal\nfunds rate?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, our expectations are little changed. I mean, the projections we\nreleased today are essentially identical to those. And I think the market is aware of the views of\n\nparticipants and is assessing evidence itself to form their own views. And it ’s imp ortant that the\nmarket take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants\nare interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy. So it ’s not an unhealthy thing to have\nsuch a gap. And , as I just said, our own view s are not set in stone but are likely to evolve as well\nover time.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mart y Crutsinger, Associated Press . Back in 2013, when\nyou—the F ed first raised the possibility of trimming its bond purchases, it created a bit of\nturbulence in financial m arkets. The taper tantrum caused you to reassess your communication\nof that process . This trimming of the bond holdings, though—the financial market s seem to be\ntaking that in a better way. If down the road, though, you see that there is more of an adverse\nreaction, are you planning to make any changes, perhaps change the caps to $30 billion, in the $20 billion caps? How do you assess how you’ ll handle that going forward?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since our—at least\nsince our 2014 normalization principles , that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual\nand predictable way. And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved. And today ’s ann ouncement is another step in\nproviding further details about how we plan to proceed s o that when this plan does go into effect,\nno one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work.\nI think that we —the plan is one that is consc iously intended to avoid creating market\nstrains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan. My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it’ s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run\nquietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our\n\nbalance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it ’s something that the C ommittee\nwill not be reconsidering from time to time. We think this is a workable plan, and it will, as one\nof my colleagues, President Harker , described it, it will be like watching paint dry, that this will\njust be something that runs quietly in t he background. So that ’s my expectation and our\nintention. Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surpr ise and a substantial reaction , that is\nsomething we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. A couple\nof comments from A dministration officials I wanted to get your reaction to . The Treasury\nSecretary and others have suggested that Dodd- Frank regulation and the way it ’s been impl ied—\napplied have restricted credit growth in the economy, banks are not making loans that they otherwise would, and that has slowed growth. Do you agree with that? And if you get a new Vice Chair of Supervision who wanted to ease up on regulation, would you go along with that?\nAlso, I wanted to ask you —it’ s been reported the President has congratulated you on being a\n“low interest ” person. Would you agree with that characterization of your philosophy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, with respect to the impact of c redit con ditions and bank\nregulation on slow growth, I ’ve previously , in testifying , indicated that I don ’t think that our\nregulations have played an important role , at least broadly speaking , in impeding credit growth\nand the growth of the economy. And I ’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting\nthat cred it growth continues to be healthy, including among small —smaller community banks\nthat are most concerned with regulatory burden. I think when banks are undercapitalized and\nweak, that i mpedes credit growth. And when banks are strong, they ’re in a much better position\nto lend. So that ’s been a view that I ’ve stated previously.\n\nNow, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday , a detailed report.\nAnd that ’s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it. I haven ’t had a\nchance to review it thoroughly, so I don’ t want to comment on too many details. But I would say\nit underscores the importance of capital , liquidity, stress testing, and re solution planning in\nhaving a safe and sound banking system , which are views that I and my colleagues have long\nespoused. Regulatory burden, when it ’s possible to ease it , and a good deal of the Treasury\nreport is focused on regulatory burden, that ’s some thing that all regulators should be looking to\ndo. We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity\nof institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks. We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, look ing for ways , for example, to\nsimplify capital requirements for community banks. And we ’ll continue in that direction and, in\nthat sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury repo rt. So there are\na number of areas and suggestions where our thinking aligns well. There is probably some areas where we’ re likely to have differences but quite —you know, quite a number of areas where\nwe’re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those\nrecommendations.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. And the characterization of you as a low interest rate person?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I have felt that it’ s been appropriate for interest rates to remain\nlow for a very long time. We are in the process of , as the economy strengthens , normalizing\ninterest rates. But, certainly, we ’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low. I\nthought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.\n\nKAREN MRACEK. Thank you, Karen Mracek with Market News International. Today\nyou guys outlined the details of the plan to—when you begin to e nd reinvestments. But you\nstopped short of saying exactly when it would be implemented, only saying “ this year, ” and\nadding that that depended on how the economy evolved. Can you tell us why you decided not to\ngo ahead with it today? Is there certain conditions that you’ re looking for? And then, as a\nsecond question, do you think that the —you could raise rates and begin implementation of the\nplan at the same time? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced\nwarning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare. And today ’s announcement is another step in that process. So we certainly wanted to\nget this information out before we actually undertake the beginning of this plan. And, you know, as the statement says, we ’ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but —the timing\nof initiating the plan. But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations , which, you\nknow, we will be watching —always are—we could put this into effect relatively soon. You\nasked about w hether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would\nsay, we ’ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of\nconditions.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. You mentioned the Treasury\nreport , and I just wanted to ask, how much weight do you give those recommendations in\nconsidering, you know, potential regulatory changes moving forward? And also, more specifically, one of the re commendations relates to the Volcker rule. I know you ’ve said in the\npast that, you know, it might be a good idea to re duce the burden on community banks , but it\nalso talks about potentially exempting banks with trading assets and liabilities above a certain\n\nlevel. And I was wondering if you think that that ’s an idea that ’s worth exploring , that might be\na good idea.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have previously su ggested exempting community banks,\nsmaller banks , entirely from the rule. And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the\nVolcker r ule. Implementation of it is frankly complex , and I ’m certainly open to looking at ways\nto reduce regulatory burden in that area. The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.\nSo, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see.\nBut on implementation, it’ s true that the rules were—in part reflecting the way the legislation is\nwritten —were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might\nsimplify the rule , and certainly it ’s something we ’re quite open to looking at.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. And how much weight do you give Treasury recommendations?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mean, Treasury has a —set out a list of objectives for\nregulation that I ’m sympathetic to and endorse . I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory\nburden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating sys temic risk ,\nthat’s something that all regulators should want to do. We ’ve done an awful lot of rule writing\nover the last five or six years. And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is an objective that is core to the Treasury\nreview and that we are very sympathetic with. So, while we may not agree on every detail, certainly the suggestions that are made there are ones that we will pay attention to and in many cases are already on our own list of things we should review.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires. In light of the plans to\ntrim the balance sheet hopefully later this year, what have you learned about QE and your bond-buying policies as a tool for monetary policy ? When they were launched, it wasn ’t something\n\nyou had, you know, engaged in on that scale before—a lot of fear s that it was going to create\nhyperinflation . That hasn ’t ever seem ed to come to pass. So, in light of QE as potentially a tool\nfor the future —you know, it might come back again—what have you learned about how it works\nin the economy? Like, where do you see it affect things? You know, what are sort of the lessons\nlearned of the experience?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, thanks. That ’s a great question. I mean, staff in the Federal\nReserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE . I think\nthe general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer -\nterm interest rates, so -called ter m premiums embedded in longer -term interest rates. There ’s\ndisagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it ’s something\nthat’s difficult to pin down. But , obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the\ncontrary. I mean, that was never my expectation , but I do remember when people were afraid\nthat that would happen.\nWe do have the tools. We have, you know, even with a large balance sheet —we intend\nto shrink our balance sheet now , but even with a large balance sheet, we retain the ability to\nmove the fed funds rate and set it as appropriate for the needs of the economy. So I think we\nhave learned that it works. It’s a valuable part of the toolkit. It’s something that, if we were t o\nencounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where —I’ve said we want the fed funds\nrate and movements in short -term interest rates, that’ s our go- to number one main policy tool —\nbut if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly\nbalance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe , based on the\nevidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit. And we have said in the\n\nbullets that we released today on our ba lance sheet that in such of —an episode of such extreme\nweakness in the future, those are things we would consider going forward.\nMICHAEL DERBY. One small follow -up. Is $4½ trillion sort of a natural limit to how\nhigh you might want to push the balance sh eet, or could you envision it going higher if you\nneeded it to?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we ’ve had no discussion of that issue, you know. And our\nfocus now is on getting it back to a more normal size. But I would say , the use of QE in the\nUnited States relat ive to the size of our economy is not as high as it ’s been in some other\ncountries that have employed it. But that ’s something we haven ’t seriously even discussed.\nPATRICK GILLESPIE. Chair Yellen , Patrick Gillespie with CNN. It’s workforce\ndevelopment w eek at the White House , and you highlighted several job training —successful job\ntraining programs in your speech in March. The President ’s budget has a 40 percent cut to job\ntraining programs. What is your response to the budget cut to job training programs even though\nthey expect to expand apprenticeship programs? And do you believe that job training programs\nand apprenticeships are needed to help fix the job skills gap in the economy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I ’m not going to comment on the P resident ’s budget , and these\nprograms can be undertaken at many different levels. I’ve seen many nonprofits and states and\nlocal authorities put in place programs that looked to me to be successful. I do think we have a\ntight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they ’re finding difficulty\nidentifying workers with the appropriate skills. In my own discussions with businesses, what I\nhear more of —and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market —larger firms\nare spending more on tr aining and trying to, given that they can’ t hire workers with the ideal\nskills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available. What I hear from CEOs of smaller\n\nfirms is that they don ’t have the ability to launch such programs. They would real ly very much\nlike to participate along , for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such\nprograms launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training.\nSo I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you\nknow, existed for a long time —downward pressure on wages and job opportunities, especially\nfor those with less skills —I think that this is something that deserves priority."
