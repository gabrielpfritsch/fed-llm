I will start with a\nrecap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the\njudgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet. I will cover the\ndecisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to\nmake decisions in coming meetings.\nMy colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with\na strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The U.S. economy\nis in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.\nThe jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with\nstronger wage gains. Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal. We continue to expect that the\nAmerican economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong\npace of 2018. We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time.\nDespite this positive outlook, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents\nand conflicting signals about the outlook. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies,\nparticularly in China and Europe. There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved\ngovernment policy iss ues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the\npartial government shutdown in the United States. Financial conditions tightened considerably\nlate in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018. An d, while\nmost of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and\nconsumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent. In other words, as economic\ncondit ions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our\npolicies. We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S.\nmacroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents. At such times,\ncommon- sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity —an approach that\nhas served policymakers well in the past. With that in mind, I’d like to spell out how the Federal\nOpen Market Committee has been thinking about these issues.\nAt our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job\ncreation, and price stability. We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases\nwere uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook. We therefore said\nthat we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and\nassessing their implications for the economic outlook.\nToday the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last\nseveral months warrant a patient, wait- and-see approach regarding future policy changes. In\nparticular, our statement today says, “In light of global economic and financial developments and\nmuted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determin es what future adjustments\nto the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.”\nThis change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy.\nLike many forecasters, we still see “sustained expansion of economic activi ty, strong labor\nmarket conditions, and inflation near . . . 2 percent” as the likeliest case. But the crosscurrents I\nmentioned suggest the risk of a less favorable outlook. In addition, the case for raising rates has\nweakened somewhat. The traditional case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks\nthat arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too- high inflation. Over the\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage past few months, that risk appears to have diminished. Inflation readings have been muted, and\nthe recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months.\nFurther, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey -based measures of inflation\nexpectations have been stable, financial market measures of i nflation compensation have moved\nlower. Similarly, the balance—the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a\nnumber of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved\ncloser to historical norms. In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by\nbeing patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy.\nLet me now turn to balance sheet normalization. Over its past three meetings, the FOMC\nhas held in- depth discussions on the stages of this process. Today we made some important\nprogress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary\nPolicy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today’s F OMC\nstatement.\nThe Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our\ncurrent operating procedure for implementing monetary policy. That is, we will continue to use\nour administered rates to control the policy rate with an am ple supply of reserves so that active\nmanagement of reserves is not required. This is often called a “floor system” or an “abundant\nreserves system.” Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the\nimplementation note released today, th is means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool,\nis held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve’s administered rates of\ninterest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without\nmanaging the supply of reserves actively. As the minutes of our recent discussions have\nindicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short -term\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective tran smission of those rates to\nbroader financial conditions.\nSettling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further\nquestions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization. The decision to retain\nour current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the\nultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions’ demand for\nreserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not requir e us to make frequent\nsizable market interventions. Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but\nwe know that this demand in the post -crisis environment is far larger than before. Higher reserve\nholdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must\nnow hold. Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve\ndemand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago. The implication is that the\nnormali zation of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance\nsheet, than in previous estimates.\nIn light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing\nreserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appro priate timing for the end of balance sheet\nrunoff. This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance\nsheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual- mandate objectives and avoiding\nunnecessary market disrupti on. We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings.\nThe process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented. Throughout this process\nwe’ve attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we’ve been willing to make changes as\nwe learn more about the process. The implementation and normalization statement released\ntoday is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage might adjust our plans. The statement makes three points: First, as we’ve long emphasi zed, the\nfederal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool.\nSecond, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not\nhesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments. This does not mean\nthat we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted.\nThird, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017.\nWhile the federal funds rate would remain our acti ve tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios,\nwe recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy\nis not sufficient. In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools,\nincluding balance sheet policy.\nTimes of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC\npolicy. We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we’re doing it, both\nregarding the path of rates and also regarding management of the balance sheet. We believe that\nthis transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability.\nThank you. I ’ll be glad to take your questions.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So you’ ve said many times\nrecently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn ’t be so. You ’ve said recently that\npolicy —the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn’ t require that\nanymore. Is that still the case? If so, how do you justify the removal of the need for some\nfurther interest rate increases? Basically, are we at neutral now , or does the economy still need\naccommodation?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now.\nWe think our policy stance is appropriat e right now . We do. We also know that our policy rate\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage is now in the range of the Committee ’s estimates of neutral. So we ’ll be—again, we think our\npolicy stance is appropriate.\nHEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. Last week, the IMF said\nrisks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy. Can you clarify —\ndoes the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the\nstatement about risk s being balanced?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the\nrisks to the baseline , and the risks are , of course , the fact that financial conditions have tightened,\nthat global growth has slowed, as well as some, let ’s say, government -related risks like Brexit\nand trade discussions , and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown. So we\nlooked at —we look at those , and the way we think of it is that policy —we will use our policy ,\nand we have, to offset risks to the baseline. So we view the baseline as still solid , and part of that\nis the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks. So that ’s the way we ’re thinking\nabout that now.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. The Fed has linked\nits commitment to patie nce in part to subdued inflation outcomes. Would you be comfortable\nwith continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target\nby core inflation? How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation w hen\ndetermining the next move? Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is\nfavorable , and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to —these risks —are going to be\nwith us for a while. We think our stance is appropriate. We think there ’s no pressing need to\nchange our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage I would say that we ’ll be looking at a full range of data , and that will include inflation\ndata. It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum\nemployment. Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are —\nwe’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’ t look at —we look at inflatio n equally on\nboth sides. So I can ’t get into specific hypotheticals , but I do believe that we have a symmetric\nobjective , and I believe we’ ll act that way.\nRICHARD MILLER. We learned from the last minutes of the meeting that some of the\ntweaks you make t o the statement have a lot more portent than we thought. In light of that, I ’m\nwondering if you can provide us with a “ decoder ring ” for this statement. “ Adjustments ”—does\nthat suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down? And w hen you twin “ in\nlight of global economic and financial developments ” with “ muted inflation pressures, ” does that\nsuggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you’ ve talked about and\ninflation moving up before you get off the dime , so to speak, and move?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorry —say again what the first question was ?\nRICHARD MILLER. First question is, “ adjustments ”—is that meant to imply the next\nmove is as most likely to be up as down?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Ye s. I’m just going to say that the —it’ s going to depend\nentirely on the data. We ’re not making a judgment. We don’ t have a strong prior. We will be —\nwe will patiently wait and let the data clarify. Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be\nwith us for a while , and I think we ’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to —as they\nrelate to the outlook for the U.S . and that will be an important aspect as well. Your second\nquestion was?\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage RICHARD MILLER. Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the\nend of these muted inflation pressures —are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to\nchange this “ patient ” stance?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, it ’s really hard to speak about generalities. We ’ll\nbe looking at everything , but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures —you know,\nyou would want —I would want to see a need for further rate increases , and, for me, a big part of\nthat would be inflation. It wouldn’ t be the only thing , but it would certainly be importa nt.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss\nan actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now? If so, is that under\nconsideration right now , and when might we know? The second thing is, I have to nail down this\nthing. You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the “market average” or the “market outlook” for\nthe size of the balance sheet. Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3 ½ trillion? And\nif you ’re not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay. So today I ’m here to talk about decisions and also\ndiscussions about decisions that haven’ t been made. So we ’re talking about the latter thing,\nwhich is discussions , and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are. But so the Committee is —\nwhat we ’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer -run\ngoal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct —\nefficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’ t put our\ngoals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil. So there are a lot of pieces to that , and\nwe’ve learned over time that it ’s—when making these —when designing these plans, like , for\nexample, the original normalization plan, it’ s good to take your time. Let the best ideas rise to\nthe top. Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’ re really\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage comfortable with what you’ve got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly. So I don’ t\nwant to get ahead of that process today.\nBut—so we ’ve discussed —there are a number of pieces to that puzzle. There are several\ndifferent pieces to them , and I think they ’re coming —and I’m very pleased with the progress that\nwe’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those\ndiscussions. That ’s the first question. I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else ’s\nestimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today. There are estimates out there, but\nI’m not at a point today where I ’m going to be giving out numbers on that. But there are\nestimates , and I think they ’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. So, just to clarify —I’m sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of\nthe runoff? That sounds like what you said, to me.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL . Yes, it’s —so, a gain, we haven’ t made any decisions. There n o\ndecisions have been made. There are different pieces of the thing , and that is in the discussion as\none of many pieces that is in the discussion. A nd that was reflected in the last minutes, actually.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . Chairman\nPowell, I want to follow up on Steve ’s question. The size of the balance sheet obviously matters\na great deal , but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was\npurchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings. So once you are —once you reach\nthe terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage -backed securities into\nTreasuries , it will matter a great deal , of course , where along the curve the Fed resumes those\nreinvestments.\nAnd so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation\nthat would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing ,\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage perhaps , in shorter maturity assets , versus the other approach that was identified in the December\nmeeting minutes, which would be to si mply reflect issuance of the outstanding T reasury\nmaturities? And which approach do you think is more a ppropriate in the current environment ?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. These are great questions. Let me say that the question of the\nultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one , and it ’s one\nthat we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings. It won ’t be\nthe first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve. We had\ndiscussions at one of the last two meetings on this , and we haven ’t come to a judgment on that .\nAnd, you know, I wouldn’ t comment beyond saying that we understand that ’s a key question,\nand there are, you know, there are issues to be decided. There are benefits and costs to doing —\nto taking different approaches , and I wouldn’ t want to prejudge them today.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times . I am struggling a\nlittle bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago. You ’ve said\ntoday that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue\nraising rates. Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks? Can you\nspeak specifically to why you ’ve mo ved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates\nthis year to a posture of standing still?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I’d point to a couple of things. First, the narrative of slowing\nglobal growth continues, if you will. The incoming data have shown more of that. We ’ve seen\nthat both in China and in Western Europe, and so that ’s an important —that has important\nimplications for us , and that story has —let ’s just say it continues.\nAnd, in addition— I mean, I think important —possibly less important now —probably\nless important now , but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first -\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage quarter GDP. We don’ t know the ultimate resolution of it. If that ’s all there is , and the\nshutdown is gone and there isn’ t another shutdown, then we ’ll get most of that back in the\nsecond period—second quarter.\nSo those things —in addition, you know, you have to look back. Financial conditions\nbegan to tighten in the fourth quarter . And they now have persisted and remain tight er—\nsignificantly tighter, let ’s say —than they were , and that ’s something that we have to take into\naccount as well. So that ’s where we are.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. You said\nyou like to be a plain speaker , so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible. Is it fair to\ncharacterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now —a\nnew regime for the Fed? And , if not, can you put a time frame on “patient ”? Does “ patient ”\nhave some sort of time frame? And I ’m wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got\non your December 19th news conference, your later statements —do you feel you’ve put a\n“Powell put” into the markets ?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So , patience— I think we ’re going to know in hindsight ,\nbecause the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its\nimplications for the outlook. So that ’s going to be —so it’ s hard to say, you know, it’ s hard to\nthink of what to call it a t this point or how to label it.\nSo really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions.\nAnd I would say this : We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two\nthings. You know, it’ s interest rates, it’ s risk spreads, it’ s currency, it’ s the stock market, it’ s\ncredit availability, it’ s many, many factors. And what matters for financial conditions is , when\nthere are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage importa nt for us because they have important macroeconomic implications. So that ’s how we\nthink about it.\nSo we don’ t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets. But\nwhen we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that ’s something that has to play\ninto our thinking. In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions , so it’ s sort of\nthe essence of what we do.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted to ask, first of all ,\nabout whether t he Fed is gathering information about some of the new money laundering\ninformation that ’s come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any\nconcerns there? And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there’ s any kind\nof timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real -time payments and whether you’re\ngoing to build a real -time payment system?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Right. So, on the first question, I can —we don’ t comment on\nindividual investigations or whether they ’re happening. I will say that we take our enforcement\npowers very seriously , and we put them to work when we feel it’ s justified.\nIn terms of real -time payments, it’ s something we ’re very actively working on. As you\nobviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them. You know, the thing\nis, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and\ninterest groups, consumer groups , and we ’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of\nyears. We don’ t have plenary authority to just do things , for the most part , in the payment space.\nWe’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public —public interest groups —and\nall those groups around the table. And we’ve— I think we ’ve played a constructive role in that\nrespect , and I believe that will continue.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage JIM PUZZANGHERA. Thanks. Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times . You and your\ncolleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed\nnot to raise r ates—to stop raising rates. How would you respond to those who would suggest\nthat the Fed just caved to the president ’s demands?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we care about —and , really, the only thing we care\nabout at the Fed —is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately. So\nthat’s very strongly our culture. I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the\nFed would recognize that description. So we ’re always going to do what we think is the right\nthing. We ’re never go ing to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of\nour work. You know, we’re human. We make mistakes . But we ’re not going to make mistakes\nof character or integrity. And I would want the public to know that , and I would want them to\nsee that in our actions.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from F ox Business News. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman. The long -term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent. I’ve talked the last year with a\nnumber of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next\nrecession. You say that ’s your first tool , that’s your primary means of adjusting monetary\npolicy. So with a larger balance sheet —with a larger balance sheet, could you —how could you\nhandle that next re cession , then , with the combination of those two?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a\nsituation in the future —we hope not , but—we could be in a situation where we ’d like to cut rates\nmore than we can effectively , and we hit the zero lower bound. We don’ t think anything like\nthat is in the cards. Now, there’ s no reason to think that it would be. But as we said in today ’s\nrelease, if that happens, then we ’ll use the full range of our tools , and that includes the balance\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage sheet. But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate\nand forward guidance about the interest rate.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Even if you have a large balance sheet —$4 trillion? Above\n$4 trillion?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. There would be room to do substantially more.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. I just wanted to go back\nto—you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue. You mentioned a\ncouple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data. I’m wondering, as\nyou guys discussed during this week ’s meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of\nthe shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would dim inish consumer\nconfidence, have some severe ripple effects ? Just talking to other folks outside, businesses —\nclearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain. I’m just wondering about , for American\nfamilies that missed two paychecks, how is this going to play out for them for the months\nto come?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Right. So let me give you the economic side of it first—is that,\neven with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that ’s the end of it and everyone gets their\nbackpay —except the contractors, I guess, the private- sector contractors , but—some people get\ntheir backpay , then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter. So that’s that. I would\nsay that the —you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go\nthrough. I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really\ngrateful they did. I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we\nshould all be grateful for. Did that answer both your questions?\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage DONNA BORAK. Yes, it does. So you don’t see a permanent effect of this shutdown?\nAnd I’m just wondering if you’re thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of\nreaching this point again on February 15?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So would there be a p ermanent effect? As I mentioned, there\nwouldn’ t be if there isn ’t another shutdown. If there were going to be a permanent effect or a\nlasting effect, let ’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and\nthat would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the\nUnited States. That would be the channel. And I think that was something that we and many\nothers were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown. In terms of ideas for\nnot having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those , so I think that\ncould be a profitable thing to explore.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, AP. The Beige Book that was prepared for\nthis mee ting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the\ntensions there. Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting\nthe wording i n your statement?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So , trade— you sound l ike you’re an avid reader of the Beige\nBook, and that ’s great —the trade, as you will know , then —trade has been a big feature in the\nBeige Book for some time now. The Beige Book is a collection of all of our —of the comments\nthat our Reserve Bank presidents get from their D istricts. It’s incredibly valuable , because\nyou’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line. And there have been real concerns\nabout trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retal iation\nand that kind of thing. So that ’s been a concern.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage I would say the longer -term concern , though, is the negotiations that are going on. If they\nlinger, then there could be more and more uncertainty , and you worry over time that that could\nhave an effect on business confidence. So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied\nboth here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China. So\nthe concern is more a longer —for me —a longer , drawn -out set of negotiations back and forth,\nwhich could result in sapping business confidence. Uncertainty is not the friend of business.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace. I\nwant to talk to you about corporate debt. Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising\ninterest rates —we ’ve had low interest rates for so long —are you contributing to a bubble in\ncorporate debt?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So , we did —we ’ve called out corporate debt as a risk —more\nof a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, t he sense of that being that if you\nhave companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they ’re going to be less\nable to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and\nthings like that. So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn. So we watch that.\nWe also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies. In\nother words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans. The question is, what is their exposure?\nDo they retain big pieces of the loans? Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build\nup in a pipeline? So we monitor those risks very carefully. And, frankly, the banks monitor\nthem much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis. So it’ s a concern.\nIt’s something that we ’re watching. Of course, you know, November, December, and January\nwere much slower months for those sorts of things. But , you know, it’ ll be something that we ’re\nalways paying close attention to.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage GREG ROBB. Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Financial markets\nhave reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference. The Dow Jones i ndustrial\naverage is up more than, like, 500 points. There’ s a sense in the market that there’ s, you know,\nwhat people call the “ Powell put ” on the markets. Are financial markets wrong in that\nassessment?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would point to all the continuity here. You know,\nthe thing we did on the balance sheet is something we ’ve been working on for, frankly, years —\nthe thing we announced today. And so we ’re providing clarity there. I think that ’s a\nconstructive thing to do.\nMy—honestly —only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the\nAmerican people—that ’s it. And this situation, I think, calls for patience —I think it does. And\nit’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate. We see these uncertainties , and we see a\ntime wh en we can afford to —we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch , and that ’s\nwhat we ’re planning to do. And I think it’ s the right thing . I feel strongly that it is.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last\nyear completed its f intech c harter . And one of the questions around that charter has been\nwhether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system. I’m\ncurious if you think a f intech c harter is a good idea in general , and what conditions you think\nmight be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment\nsystem.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I’m not going to be able to help you much on that. Those are\ngreat questions , and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are\nlooking at. I think we ’re open to these ideas , but I don’ t have any news for you on that today.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage STEVE BECKNER. Thank you. Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.\nMr. Chairman, you’ve echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and\nelsewhere in the world , but I wonder whether it’ s possible that slower growth abroad might\nactually be beneficial to this country , in some respects , at least —for example, perhaps increasin g\ncapital inflows and putting downward pressure on long -term rates in this country, as happened in\nthe Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, Steve, it’ s certainly possible. Ultimately , though,\nyou know, a strong global economy is good for us. We export to these countries. We trade with\nthese countries. I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept\ncoming in stronger and stronger , and that meant the euro was strong , and that supported our\nexports. So , ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point\nto an interesting case.\nMARK HAMRICK. Chairman Powell, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Thank you. As\nyou probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected\nto surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of\nWorld War II. First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the\nAdministration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO? And\nthen, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that ’s even\nclose to being true?\nCHAIRM AN POWELL. So , first, it is important —we don’ t do fiscal policy. We don’ t\nadvise the government or Congress on fiscal policy , so I’ll limit myself to more high -level\ncomments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long -known fact that the U.S. federal g overnment\nbudget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed. And that is driven principally\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage by the combination of health- care costs —really , due to our health- care delivery system —and the\naging of the population. And there’ s no time like now—when the economy is healthy, growing,\npeople are working —to go after that problem. Ultimately, we will have to. We don’ t have a\nforecast. We don’ t forecast those things. I have no reason to doubt CBO ’s numbers on this. I\nhaven ’t actually looked at that report , but my general experience with them is that it’ s a\nprofessional outfit.\nMARK HAMRICK. What does that look like , if that really takes place 10 years down\nthe road?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, you know, first of all, our —the work that we do relates\nmore to the medium term rather than the long term. And so I don ’t see this , in particular , as a\nthreat to this business cycle or to the economy this year. It’s more in the longer run, we ’ll be\nspending all of our money on paying interest and not on the t hings that we really need to be\ndoing for future generations and for our own generation. So it’ s a serious problem , but it’ s not a\nproblem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. I know\nwhere the FOMC participants ’ estimates for the long -run interest rate are. They ’re all above\n2½ percent. Right now we’re between 2.25 and 2½. So I think a key question right now is, is\npolicy accommodative at this moment? Are we looking at staying accommodative for some\ntime, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets?\nThanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at\n2½ percent , and th at’s kind of roughly where we currently are. And as I ’ve said a couple of\ntimes, when you get to that range —you know that we can ’t directly observe the neutral rate. We\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage only know it by its works. And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that r ate might be\nand let the data speak to us. So we can do that. We’re in the range. There are a number of\nCommittee members who are, you know, right around that range. And I think we ’re watching\nto see.\nWe don’ t—I don’t —again, I think that our policy sta nce today is appropriate for the state\nof the economy. That ’s my feeling. We’ re going to be watching data to see whether that ’s right ,\nand we ’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and\nhow the U.S. economy performs this year.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Thank you. Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse.\nAmong the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American\nexpansion would be the prospect of a “hard” Brexit?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So we ’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully\nfor a long time. And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either\nin the U .K. or in the EU or both. So we have worked with those institutions alongside U .K. and\nEU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of\nthe things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes. So we ’ve done a lot of\nwork on that , and, generally speaking —again, a lot of w ork has been done —we have to be\nhumble and say that this is an unprecedented event. But that ’s the financial system aspect of it.\nIf there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the\ncontinental economy and certainly to t he U .K. economy , and we would feel that. The question\nfor us —it wouldn’ t be a huge first -order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial\ndisruptions. So , if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it\nwould reach us.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage I would expect that we would feel some of this , and it’ s very hard to have great\nconfidence that you know what that would be . But it would be something —probably not\nmaterial to our economy , but it’ s something we ’ll be watching very carefully and certainly\nhoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, I’m Jean Yung with Market News. I have a question about the\nultimate size of the bala nce sheet. How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for\nfinancial institution s’ demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past\nyear and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same\ntime frame? Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to\nencourage banks from holding —to hold less reserves?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Let me be clear . I don ’t know that demand for reserves has\nrisen over the past years. I think our understanding of demand for reserves —remember that the\nbanks have more reserves th an they need. Reserves are still quite abundant.\nSo the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end\nafter, you know, after t he firms adjust to our very gradual decrease? And so our understanding ,\nreally , of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past\nyear. And then there would be a buffer on top of that. And then we would want to be —we\nwould want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in\nan abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates.\nIf you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these\nbig, ongoing interventions in the market. We don’ t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large\nongoing presence in the market around this. We ’d rather just, you know —in managing the\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage federal funds rate, we ’d rather have it set by our administered rate s. So that implies you’d want\nto be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is.\nAnd, again, there’ s no cookbook here, there ’s no playbook. No one really knows. The\nonly way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligen ce and then,\nultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully.\nJEAN YUNG. But do you take the survey result s as given , or do you try to encourage\nbanks from holding a [inaudible ]?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. We don’ t take— you know, we don’ t think we have a precise\nunderstanding of this at all. I want to be clear about that. These estimates are fairly uncertain.\nSo if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the\nmiddle] , all you can say is , it’s probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart,\nequidistant from the middle] .\nIf banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason— which is to say , to hold\nliquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio , to meet their resolution\nrequirements and resolution planning —we ’re not going to discourage them from holding them.\nThey are , in fact , a very safe asset —in a way, the safest asset. And we want the banks to be safe\nand sound.\nWe didn’ t create the reserv es, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since —in the\npost-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand- new and quite substantial liquidity\nrequirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit. So it’ s not a bad thing\nthat ba nks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset. We don’ t—we ’re not encouraging\nthem to hold reserves inste ad of T reasuries . Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for\nthis purpose.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. A data-\ndependency question: H as there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data?\nHow do you balance those two things?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum\nemployment and stable prices , and that ’s about, you know, hard, real -side economic data. We —\nas I mentioned earlier, we —our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy\nthrough financial conditions. So financial conditions matter , and they matter in the way that I\nsuggested ear lier—which is to say , broad financial conditions changing over a sustained\nperiod—that has implications for the macroeconomy . It does. So if you lower interest rates and\nthey stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate. That ’ll have an\neffect on —over time , an effect on the economy. But, again, the entire focus we have is on\nmaximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial\nconditions generally.\nMYLES UDLAND. Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance. I would just\nask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general . And are you surprised at how much of a\nconversation we ’re having around the balance sheet , and how much talk about the balance sheet\nfrom you rself and various Fed official s have moved financial markets? Because putting out a\nstatement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising,\nconsidering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal with balance\nsheet normalization —to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy. And so I would just ask,\nare you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in\ndesigning the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019 Chairman Powell’s Press C onference \nPage We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was —that would be confusing to\nmarkets. So what we did was we set up the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that was\nvery transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to T reasuries , pretty much\nthe exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands.\nAnd we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and\nunderstood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have inter est rates be\nthe active tool of policy.\nSo that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one\nfor our policy and for the benefit of the country. I think that there’s —I think the market is now\nlooking for more clarity around that , and I think we’ll be providing it. That ’s what ’s happened.\nThanks very much."
