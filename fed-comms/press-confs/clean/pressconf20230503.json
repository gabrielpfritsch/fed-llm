  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. Before discussing today’ s meeting, let me comment\nbriefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly\nimproved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient. We will\ncontinue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons\nfrom this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr ’s Review of the\nFederal Reserve’ s Super vision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The review ’s findings\nunderscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual\nmandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. Since early last\nyear, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we will take a data -dependent\napproach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate. I will\n\nhave more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend\npace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and\nslower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the year, job gains\naveraged 345 ,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at\n3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are\ncoming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has sown —\nshown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor\ndemand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer- term\ninflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\n\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are high ly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose —poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent. And we ’re continuing to [carry\nout] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWith today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more\nthan a year. We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest\nrate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be reali zed, especially on inflation.\nIn addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit\nconditions. Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook. But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and i nflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain.\nIn light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have\nput in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We , we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of\n\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. And we\nare prepared to do more if greater monetar y policy restraint is warranted.\nWe remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep\nlonger -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period\nof below -trend growth and some softe ning of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Tha nks. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March\nminutes and, if so , what a recession like what the y’re envisioning would look and feel like when\nit comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , taking your question—of course , today our decision was to raise\nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A , a decision on a pause was not made today. You will\nhave noticed that in the —in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the\nCommittee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. Tha t sentence is ,\nis not in, in the statement anymore. We took that out , and instead we ’re saying that, in\n\ndetermining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation\nto 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into a ccount certain factors. So we —that ’s a—\nthat’s a meaningful change that we’ re no longer saying that we anticipat e. And so we ’ll be\ndriven by incoming data meeting by meeting. And, you know, we ’ll approach that question at\nthe June meeting. So the —the staff ’s forecast is —so let me say —start by saying that that ’s not\nmy own most likely case, which is really that , that the economy will continue to grow at , at a\nmodest rate this year. And I think that ’s—so different people on the Committee have different\nforecasts. That ’s, that ’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [The] s taff produces its\nown forecast, and it ’s independent of the forecasts of , of the participants, which include the\nGovernors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course. And we think this is a healthy thing—\nthat the , the staff is writing down what they really think. They ’re not especially influenced by\nwhat the G overnors think, and vice versa. The Governors are not taking what the staff says and\njust writing that down. So it ’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can\nhave different perspectives. So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, a nd by that I\nwould charact erize as one in which the ris e in unemployment is smaller than is —has been typical\nin modern- era recessions. I wouldn’ t want to characterize the staff ’s forecast for this meeting.\nWe’ll, we ’ll leave that to the minutes —but broadly, broadly similar to tha t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.\nThanks for taking our questions. I ’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible\neffects of a debt -limit standoff. You ’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised , but do\nyou see any economic s effects of even getting close to a default? And what type of situation\nwould that look like?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’ t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:\nThese are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they ’re, they ’re for Congress and the\nAdministration —for the elected parts of the government to deal with. And they’ re really\nconsigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling\nbe raised in a timely way , so that the U .S. government can pay all of its bills when they’ re due.\nA failure to do that would be unprecedented. We’d be in uncharted territory, and the —and the\nconsequences to the U .S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite\na[d]verse. So I’ll just leave it there. We , we don’t give advice to either side. We just would\npoint out that it—that it ’s very important that this be done. And the , the other point I’ll make\nabout that, though, is that no one should assume that the F ed can protect the economy from the\npotential, you know, short - and long- term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. We, we —\nit’s, it would be so uncertain that it ’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place\nwhere we’ re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U .S. government ’s not\npaying its bills.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And just a follow -up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a\npossible standoff —did that affect today ’s monetary policy decision at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t say that it did. It was —of course, it ’s something that\ncame up. We talk a lot about risks to the —to the outlook, and that will —that c ome up. A\nnumber of people did raise tha t as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn’ t say that it was important in\ntoday’ s monetary policy decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC.\nCan you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation\n\nwhere you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest\nrate risks? And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ ve done in the wake of the recent\nbank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk ?\nAnd kind of part 3 , but it ’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation\nprinciple that mone tary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the February 14 presentation—I didn’ t remember it very\nwell. But now, of course, I ’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And\nwhat it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole B oard—\nthe entire B oard. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks\nand, and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Val ley Bank, which talked about, you\nknow, the amount of losses they—or mark -to-market losses they had in their portfolio. There\nwas nothing in it about —that I recall, anyway, about , about the risk of a bank run. So it was —I\nthink the takeaway was , they were going away to do a —an assessment, a vertical —sorry,\nhorizontal assessment of , of banks. It wasn ’t—it, it wasn ’t presented as an urgent or alarming\nsituation. It was presented as a —as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing. And I\nthought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.\nIn terms of what we ’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are , are—many, many\nbanks are now , are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since , since the\nevents of , of early March, to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. I—\nyou know, like so many things, it, it’ s very useful. But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits. I\nmean, I , I think in this particular case , we have found that the monetary policy tools and the\nfinancial stability tools are not in conflict. They ’re both—they ’re working well together. We ’ve\nused our , our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And, at the\n\nsame time, we ’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment\nand price stability.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ’m sorry. I don’ t mean to be argumentative, but\nthe, the staff report said , “SVB . . . has significant interest rate risk. ” It said, “I nterest rate risk\nmeasurement [s] . . . failed ” at SVB. And it said, “ Banks with large unrealized losses face\nsignificant safety and soundness ri sks.” Why was that not alarming?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, I didn’ t say it wasn ’t alarming. It was —they ’re\npointing out something that they’ re working on and that they’ re on the case—that , that, you\nknow, that —I’m not sure whether they mentioned —I thi nk they did, actually. They mentioned\nthat they had taken regulatory action matter —or supervisory action in the form of matters\nrequiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say : Yes, this is\na bank , and there are many other banks that are experiencing this —these things, and we ’re on the\ncase.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask —obviously, with the recent\nbank turmoil, we ’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks. And I was just curious whether you\nthink that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial\nstability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U .S. getting even\nlarger.\nCHAIR POWELL . So I, you know, we certainly don’ t—and I don’ t have an agenda to\nfurther consolidate banks. There’ s been —consolidation has been a factor in the U .S. banking\nindustry really since interstate banking and before that even—i t goes back more than 30 years.\nYou—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks. Now there\n\nare 4,000 and change. So that ’s, that ’s going on. I personally have long felt that having small -,\nmedium -, and large -size banks is a, a great part of our banking system. You know, the\ncommunity banks serve particular customers very wel l; regional banks serve very important\npurposes , and the various kinds of G -SIBs do as well. So I think it ’s healthy to have a, you\nknow, an arrange— a range of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that ’s a\npositive thing. Is it a financial —so I would just say, in terms of J .P. Morgan buying First\nRepublic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.\nThat, that is their ro le, so I really don’ t have a comment on , on that process. As you know,\nthere’ s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank. So it was legitimate. And I think the\nFDIC , I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least -cost bi d. So I w ould assume\nthat’s what they did.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. S o do you have any concerns about the fact that they’ re, they’ re\ngetting larger in general ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I think it ’s probably good policy that we , we don’ t want the\nlargest banks doing big acquisi tions. That is the policy. And —but this is —this is an exception\nfor a failing bank. And I , I think it ’s actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also\nwould have —would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the\nregional banks bought , bought this company. And that could have been the outcome. But ,\nultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is , it goes to the , the least -cost\nbid.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Now to Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Col by Smith with the Financial Times. At the March\nmeeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be\n\nequal to one or more rate increases. So, given developments since then, how has your estimate\nchanged?\nCHAIR P OWELL. Yeah. I think— I think I follow that up by saying, it’ s, it’s quite\nimpossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But, in principle, that ’s the\nidea. You know, when we—we ’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the pr ice of credit ,\nand that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism. And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tight er in a kind of\nbroadly similar way. It isn ’t—it isn ’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one\nand the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we ’re trying it. But , ultimately, we\nhave to be —we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.\nSo it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates —in principle, we won ’t have\nto raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happene d. The extent of that is so\nhard to predict because we don ’t know how persistent these , these effects will be. We don ’t\nknow how large they’ ll be and how long they’ ll take to be transmitted. But that ’s, that ’s what\nwe’ll be watching carefully to find out.\nCOLBY SMITH. Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the\nCommittee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if , if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?\nCHAIR POWELL . It’s that —this is just something that we have to factor in as we —as\nwe want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of , of the extent\nto which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one , meeting by\nmeeting, and we ’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that —they ’re listed in , in\n\nthe statement, the obvious factors. That ’s, that ’s the way we’ re going to be thinking about it.\nAnd that ’s really all we can do. As I say, it does complicate —we, we have, you know, a broad\nunderstanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing. There’ s a lot of\nliterature on that. But translating it into , into rate hikes is uncertain , let’s say —it adds even\nfurther uncertainty. Nonetheless, we’ ll be able to see what ’s happening with credit conditions —\nwhat ’s happening with lending. We get —there’ s a lot of data on that. And, you know, we ’ll,\nwe’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.\nMICH ELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So, noting that\nthe statement dropped the reference to “ sufficiently ” restricted —“restrictive, ” I was wondering,\ngiven your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,\nsufficiently restrictive.\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s going to be an ongoing assessment. We ’re going to need data\nto accumulate on that —not an assessment that we’ ve made, as —that , that would mean we think\nwe’ve reached that point. And I just think it ’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.\nBut, nonetheless, you, you will know that the S ummary of E conomic P rojections from the March\nmeeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was —\nthis was the appropriate level of the —of the ultimate high level of rates. We don ’t know that.\nWe’ll revisit that at the June meeting. And that ’s—you know, we ’re just going to have to—\nbefore we real ly declare that, I think we ’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you\nknow, make that —as I mentioned, it ’s an ongoing assessment.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. I have a follow -up on credit. Could you give us a sense of\nwhat the SLOOS survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were\n\ntightening credit as of the, the last survey. What did this one show, and how did that weigh into\nyour deliberations?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in li ne\nwith our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent , when you\nsee it , with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we ’re seeing\nfrom other sources. You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have —some of them had been tightening their lending standards.\nBanking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument\naround the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was\nto give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as you’ve discussed, the Fed staff p rojected a recession starting later this year. So my question is\nwhy it was necessary to raise interest rates today . Or, put , put differently : If the whole point of\nslowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ ve, for the last two\nmeetings , been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to\nkeep moving?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we—the reason is that we —again, with our monetary policy\nwe’re try —trying to reach and then—and then stay at a , for an extended period, a level of\npolicy—a policy stance that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over\ntime. And, you know, that ’s what we ’re trying to do with our —with our tool. I think slowing\ndown was the right move. I , I think it ’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do\n\nso. So I , I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance. We always have to balance\nthe risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of\nmaybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along\nwith the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to\nHoward ’s question—you’ ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six -week intermeeting cycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment\nwill be an ongoing one. You—you know, you can’ t—with , with economic data, you, you\ncan’t—you’ ve, you’ ve seen —take inflation for a minute. Look, look back. We’ ve seen inflation\ncome down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We’ve seen inflation have\na few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you’ re going to want to\nsee that —you know, that a few months of data will , will persuade you that you’ ve—that you’ ve\ngot this right , kind of thing. And, you know, we , we have the luxury: W e’ve raised 500 basis\npoints. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably —that you can calculate them\nmany different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a , a reasonable\nestimate of , of, let’s say , one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent. So you’ ve got 2 percent\nreal rates. That ’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,\nwould assess as, yo u know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight. And you see that in interest —\ninterest -sensitive activities. And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.\nAnd if you—if you put the —you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that ’s, that ’s\n\nongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we ’re, we may not be far off —we’re possibly\neven at —that level.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with\nFox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections\nshow , at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of\n3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Look —I think we ’re always going to have 2 percent as our , our\ntarget . We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it ’s—let me just say , that ’s not what we ’re looking for.\nWe’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time. I mean, we —that ’s, that ’s not a\nquestion that ’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But , ultimately,\nwe’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools. We have a, a goal of getting to\n2 percent. We think it ’s going to take some time. We don ’t think it’ ll be a smooth process.\nAnd, you know, I think we ’re going to—we ’re going to need to stay at this for a while.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. How does the other side of the mandate —the jobs side —once\nyou get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at\nthat point . Right now , you have a labor market that ’s still extraordinarily tight. You still got\n1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number , for every unemployed person. We\ndo see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions. But, overall, you’ re near a\n50-year low in unemployment. Wages —you all will have seen that the wage number from late\n\nlast week, and it ’s—whenever it was. And, you know, it ’s, it’s a couple of percentage points\nabove what would be —what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So we do\nsee some softening ; we see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments.\nBut the labor market is very, very strong, where as inflation is, you know, running high—well\nabove our —well above our goal. And right now , we need to be focusing on bringing inflation\ndown. Fortunately, we ’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATTHEW BO ESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.\nSo, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed\nofficials ’ projections did imply or seem ed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast\nas well, given the strong first -quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I ’m just wondering if you\ncould kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’ re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,\ngiven that that ’s the F ed staff ’s forecast —possibly also the broader Committee ’s forecast as\nwell—and , and also, of course, most private -sector forecasters ’.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . I don ’t think —you know, I know what ’s printed in the\nSummary of E conomic P rojections and all that. I don’ t think you can deduce exactly what you\nsaid about what participants think, because you don’ t know what they were thinking for first -\nquarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I ’ll just say , I, I continue to think that it ’s possible that this time is really different.\nAnd the reason is , there ’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It’s, it’s\ninteresting , as, you know, we ’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the\nunemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was —even lower than where it was\nwhen we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see—by surveys and much,\n\nmuch [other] evidence —that, that conditions are cooling gradually. But it’ s—it really is\ndifferent. You know, it wasn’ t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of\nthe—as they ’ve declined without unemployment going up. Well, that ’s what we ’ve seen. So\nwe—there are no promises in this. But it just seems that, to me , that it’ s possible that we can\ncontinue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment\nthat have gone with many, you know, prior episodes. Now, that would be a gainst history. I , I\nfully appreciate that. That would be against the , the pattern. But I do think that it —that this, that\nthe situation in the labor market , with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are\nactually —wages have been moving down. Wag e increases have been moving down, and that ’s a\ngood sign—down to a more sustainable level. So I think that —I think it ’s still possible. I —you\nknow, I think, you know, the , the case of , of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely\nthan that of having, having a recession. But it’ s not —it’ s not that the case of having a recession\nis—I don’ t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild\nrecession.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still\nwell above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation. Do you see that as well? And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we look at a range of wage , wage measures. And then\nthat’s in nominal. And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases\nplus inflation. And so you ca n—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation\nindex, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta w age t racker, compensation per hour —basically ,\nthose four and many others. And you can—you can look at , at what the —what they would have\nto run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation. They can\n\ndeviate. You know, corporate margins can go up and down. And there is a feature of long\nexpansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later , later in a\nrecession —sorry, later in an expansion. So, yeah. The, the—you know, and we calculate those,\nand you have to take the precision with a degree of —a degree of salt. But I would say that what\nthey will show is that, you know, if , if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer\nto where they need to be. Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get —to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. I—by the way, I don’ t want\nto—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You ’re asking me a very\nspecific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together.\nAnd it ’s very hard to say what ’s causing what. But, you know, I ’ve never said that, you know,\nthat—that wages are really the principal driver , because I don ’t think that ’s really right.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Well, you mentioned\nprofit margins. Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’ t\nfallen as much as might be expected, given that we ’re seeing at least some pullback among\nconsumer spending. So , speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a\ndriver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to\nreduced inflation in the coming months?\nCHAIR POWELL. So higher profits and higher m argins are what happens when you\nhave an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply. And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where , where supply has been fixed or ,\nor not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.\nSo to get, I , I think—as goods pipelines have , have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we\n\ndon’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation\ncome dow n. And you’ ll see —you’ ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of\nfull competition , where there’ s enough supply to meet demand. And then it ’s—then it ’s, then\nyou’re really back to full competition. That ’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you\ntell us something about what your policy reaction function is —your policy framework is going\nforward? When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,\nwhich is, by definition, backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is\ngoing to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?\nCHAIR POWELL. I didn ’t catch the last part. Rolling ?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Do you\nrule that out?\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay , I got it. So, what are we looking\nat? I mean, we look at a combination of data and , and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is\nto—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we ’re always, always\nlooking at both. You know, and it will —of course , it’ll be the obvious things. It ’ll be readings\non infla tion. It ’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of\nthose many things. I think a particular focus for us going—now , over the past six, seven weeks\nnow and going forward is going to be , what ’s happening with credit tighte ning? A re small and\nmedium -sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on\nlending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.\nThat’ll, that ’ll be an important thing. I just —you know, we ’ll be looking at everything. It’s—\n\nagain, I would just point out , we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points. We are shrinking the\nbalance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but\nperhaps a little bit more , due to what ’s happened. And we have to factor all of that in and, and\nmake our assessment of —you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And\nwe have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable l ags. So this is\nchallenging. But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that ’s what we think.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. What about the idea of rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we on the Committee have a —have a view that inflation is\ngoing to come down—not so quickly, but it ’ll take some time. And in that world, if that forecast\nis broadly right, it would not be appropriate and —to cut rates, and we won’ t cut rates. If you\nhave a different forecast and, you know, markets —or have been, from time to time , pricing in,\nyou know, quite rapid reducti ons in inflation, you know, we ’d, we ’d factor that in. But that ’s not\nour forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation\nmoves down. Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn ’t moved\nmuch. And it ’s quite stable. And, you know, so we think we ’ll have to —demand will have to\nweaken a little bit, and labor market conditions , conditions may have to soften a bit more to\nbegin to see progress there. And, again, in that world, i t wouldn’ t be—it wouldn’ t be appropriate\nfor us to cut rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I ’m curious how you view the\nrole of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress . Do you\nthink it ’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to\n\ncompete with banks for deposits? And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of\nthe facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.\nAnd, you know, the —it’ s, it’s really not contributing, we don’ t think, now. It hasn ’t actually\nbeen growing. You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the —when , when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have\nreally stabilized now —what happened was , institutional investors took their uninsured deposits\nand put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that. Over the course of , of maybe the last year, retail investors had\nbeen gradual —as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ ve been gradually moving their deposits\ninto higher -yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.\nSo that ’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a , a tightening cycle. What\nwas unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that. But it doesn’ t seem to have had any —any effect\noverall on the over night repo facility. That is really there to , to help us keep rates where they ’re\nsupposed to be, and it ’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sarah.\nSARAH EWALL -WICE. Sarah Ewall -Wice, CBS News. I want to go back to the debt\nceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy , but can you just\nspeak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets , and borrowing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I would just say, it’ s —I , I don’ t really think we should be —\nwe shouldn’ t even be talking about a world in which the U .S. doesn’ t pay its bills. It just—it just\n\nshouldn’ t be a thing. And, and again, I would just say, we don’ t—no one should assume that the\nFed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally\nfrom , from the damage that such , such an event might inflict.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last\nweek, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the\nregulatory—or the supervisory lapse s at Silicon Valley Bank : a policy change in 2019 to exempt\nall but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019. Do you share that view, and what would it take to get the , the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be\nnecessary?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I didn’ t—I didn’ t take part in creating the report or doing the\nwork, but I do— I have read it, of course. And I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this\nway: A, a very large —a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly\nand unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system. I thin k\nthe only thing that , that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,\nand, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is —may, it may just have\nbeen technology evolving. You know, we have to keep up with all that. But some of it may be\nour policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever. What our job is now is , identify those\nthings and implement them. And that ’s kind of the only thing I care about is —and I think— I\nfeel like I am accountable for doing e verything I can to make sure that that happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Evan.\n\nEVAN RYSER. Thank you. Evan R yser with M NI Market News. Chair Powell, are we\nin the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks? And,\nsecondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would— I guess I would say it this way. There were\nthree large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we —\nthat we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of , of First Republic\nkind of draws a line under that period of —is an important step toward drawing a line under that\nperiod of , of severe stress. Okay. I also think we are very focused on what ’s happening with\ncredit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the —in the Beige Book, and\nyou will see in the SLOOS , is, is small and medium—medium -sized, small and medium -sized\nbanks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards —build liquidity. What ’s going\nto be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we , we will continue to very care fully\nmonitor what ’s going on in the banking system, and we ’ll factor that assessment into our\ndecisions in an important way, going forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Fed Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just\nwondered i f you ’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up\nto it over the last—since you’ ve been Fed Chairman, I think I ’ve heard you say a couple of times\nthat you defer red to the Vice C hair for S upervision. Do you think that was the right way to go\nabout this? And , yeah, comments on that. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say, first of all, I ’ve been Chair of the Board for\nfive-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think w e’ve learned some\n\nnew things as well, and we need to do better. And , as I mentioned, I thought the report was\nunflinching and appropriately so. I welcome it. And I agree with and will support those\nrecommendations. And I do feel that I ’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster\nmeasures that will address the problems. So, on, on the V ice C hair for S upervision, you know,\nthe place to start is , is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The Vice Chair, it says, shall\ndeploy policy recommendations —“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding\nsupervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies . . . , and shall oversee the\nsupervision and regulation of such firms.” So this is Congress establishing a four -year term for\nsomeone else on the Board—not , not the C hair—as V ice C hair for Supervision who really gets\nto set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors. Congress wanted\nthat person to be —to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it\nworks —the way it has worked in practice f or me is , I’ve had a good working relationship. I give\nmy, my counsel, my input privately, and that ’s—I offer that. And I have good conversations,\nand I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that\nperson, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and , and his predecessor. And I think\nthat’s the way it ’s supposed to work, and that ’s appropriate. I, I believe that ’s what the law\nrequires. And, you know —but , but it isn ’t—I wouldn’ t say it’ s a matter of complete deference.\nIt’s more , I have a —I have a role in , in presenting my views and discussing—having an\nintelligent discussion about what ’s going on and why. And, you know, that ’s, that ’s my input.\nBut, ultimately , that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of\nGovernors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.\nGREG ROBB. Just wondered if you have any regrets? Or was there anything that, you\nknow —decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what ’s happened?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve had a few , sure. I mean, you know, who doesn’ t look back and\nthink that you could have done things differently? But, honestly, you don’ t—you don’ t get to do\nthat. Again, my focus is on what —control the controllable. As one of my great mentors used to\nalways say, “C ontrol the controllable.” What we control now is , make a fair assessment, learn\nthe right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them. And , and I think that , that\nVice Chair Barr ’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we ’ve got to follow through.\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. Hi, there. Megan Cas sella with Barron ’s. Did the possibility of\npausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered? I’m curious if\nyou can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again\nor what those discussions entailed.\nCHAIR POWELL. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across\nthe board. I would say there are a number of people —and, you know, you’ ll see this in the\nminutes. I don’ t want to try to do the head count in real time. But people did talk about pausing,\nbut not so much at this meeting, you know, that we ’re—I mean, there ’s a sense that we ’re,\nwe’re—that, you know, we ’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that —you\nknow, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that ’s going on through various\nchannels, it ’s—we , we feel like we —you know, we ’re getting close or , or maybe even there.\nBut that, again, that ’s going to be an ongoing assessment. And , and we ’re going to be looking at\nthose factors that we listed and —to determine whether there ’s, there ’s more to do.\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the\nstatement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report\nor inflation print be enough to push the F ed to tighten again?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I don ’t want to— I couldn’ t—I couldn’ t really say. I just think\nwe’re—I think we —look , I think we ’ve moved a long way fairly quickly. And I think we can\nafford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. And we ’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ ve learned from the banking\ncrisis —that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I just would start with something that’ s changed, really, which\nis this —the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through\nhistory. And that now needs to be reflected in some —in some way in regulation and in\nsupervision. It —we know —now that we know it ’s possible, I think we didn’ t—no one thought\nthat was possible. No one —I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite\nso quickly. So I think that, you know, that will play through. I, I, you know —it will be up to\nVice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think— I think\nthat’s one thing. I, I guess I would just say that . Then, you know —tha t we’re going to—\nobviously, we ’re going to revisit [this] . It’s pretty clear we need —to me , anyways —clear that\nwe need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I ’m, I’m\nthinking that we ’re on the —on track to do that as w ell.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Can you be any more specific on stress testing or\nlooking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. That ’s—see, that ’s, that ’s what Vice Chair Barr ’s role really\nis, and he ’ll take the lead on that.\nThank you."
