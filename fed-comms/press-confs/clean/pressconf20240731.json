My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the\npast two years. The labor market has come into better balance , and the unemployment rate\nremains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent. We are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.\nToday, the F OMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. We are att entive to\nrisks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid\npace. GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent\nlast year. Private domestic purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment,\ngovernment spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand—\ngrew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid. Investment in equipment and\nintangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment\nstalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first. Improving supply conditions have\nsupported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.\nPayroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter —a solid pace, but\nbelow that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at\n4.1 percent. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an\nincrease in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged\n25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past\nyear, and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that\nconditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic —strong, but not overheated.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our\nlonger -run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in\nJune; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent. Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a\nbroad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as\nit erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for t he American people. In\nsupport of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As\nthe labor market has cooled and infla tion has declined, the risks to achieving our employment\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nand inflation goals continue to move into better balance. Indeed, we ’re attentive to the risks to\nboth sides of our dual mandate.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the\nfederal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward 2 percent. The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much\ncould result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing\npolicy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In\nconsidering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation\npersists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.\nIf the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stabi lity is essential to\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. Our success in\ndelivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect\ncommunities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\npublic mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment\nand price -stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. T hanks for taking our\nquestions. Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage. I wonder if\nyou think that ’s a reasonable expectation , and, if so, why not just make the move today?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. S o on September, let me say this . We, we have made no\ndecisions about future meetings , and that includes the September meeting. The broad sense of\nthe C ommittee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to\nreduce our policy rate. In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will\nnot be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases. The question will be\nwhether the totality of the data, the ev olving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with\nrising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market. If that test is met, a\nreduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.\nSo you asked, why not today? And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the\nCommittee is that we ’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our\npolicy rate but that we ’re not quite at that point yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So just to, to follow up on that a bit , if inflation behaves as\nyou expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would—I would think about it this way . I’ll give an\nexample of , of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’ t be\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nappropriate to cut. So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or\nless in line with expectations, growth remains , let’s say , reasonably strong, and the labor market\nremains , you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a , a rate cut\ncould be on the table at the September meeting.\nIf, if inflation were to prove , you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from\ninflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things. You know, I\nthink it ’s going to be not just any one thing. I t’s going to be the inflation data , it’s going to be\nthe employment data , it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it —it’s going to be the\ntotality of all of that that would help us make this decision.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. And just to follow up on that —specifically , in what ways\nright now, given all you’ ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et\ncetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to\n2 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I think it ’s just a question of seeing more good data. We have\nseen—the last couple of readings have , have certainly added to confidence . And we ’ve seen\nprogress across all three categories of core PCE inflation —that’s goods , nonhousing services ,\nand housing services. So it ’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at\nthe beginning of the year . Then we saw some more good inflation data ; we had seven months at\nthe end of last year. You know, w e just want to see mo re and , and gain confidence . And, as I\nsaid, we have—we did gain confidence , and more good data would cause us to, to gain more\nconfidence.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. The March SEP\npointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at\n4 percent. Since we’ re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was\nprojected for the labor market, I ’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best\nguidepost for policy rather than, let’s say , the shallower one laid out in that June SEP.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, s o I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to\ndepend on the way the economy evolves. And I can’ t really give you any, any better forward\nguidance on it than that. We didn’ t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting. We will do another\none at the September meeting. I would just say, I can —I can imagine a scenario in which there\nwould be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves ,\nand I wouldn’ t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today. I ’ve said what I —what I can\nsay about September and about today , though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you ’ve said\nbefore that you wouldn’ t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation\nhas lagged. Does that apply for the labor market , too? If the labor market is back in equilibrium,\nwhy is restrictive policy and , potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate,\nwarranted right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the very reason that we ’re thinking about —that we ’ve said\nin our—in our statement that we ’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the\nrisks are coming back into balance. We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is\nan ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions. And that ’s what we want to see.\nYou know, w e’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move , really , from\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\noverheated conditions to more normal conditions. We are watching the labor market conditions\nquite closely , and that ’s what we ’re seeing. If we —if we start to see something that looks to be\nmore than that, then we ’re well positioned to respond. That ’s, that’s part of what we ’re thinking.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And when you talk about seeing something that ’s more than\nwhatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ ve said that stronger growth\nwouldn’ t, wouldn’t override better news on inflation. I wonder how that cuts the other way. If\nyou’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change\nthe calculus on what you’ re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So w e have , we have —growth isn ’t one of our three. We have two\nmandates, as you know . The labor market, maximum employment is one , and stable prices is\nanother. So we weigh —we weigh those two things equally under the law. When we were far\naway from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that. Now we ’re back , back to a closer to\neven focus, so we ’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we ’re getting what\nwe’re seeing .\nAnd, as I said, we’ re prepared to respond if we see that it ’s—that it’s not what we wanted\nto see, which was , you know, a gradual normalization of conditions —if we see more than that .\nAnd it wouldn’ t be any one statistic, although, of course , the unemployment rate is generally\nthought to be , you know, a single —a good single statistic . But we ’d be looking at wages , we’d\nbe looking at participation, w e’d be looking at all the things —surveys, quits, hires, all of those\nthings —to determine the overall status of the labor market. But we ’re looking at it now.\nI would say, again, I think you’ re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions,\nand that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then . I think inflation\nwas actually —core inflation was actually running below 2 percent. So we don’ t think —I don’ t\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nnow think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary\npressures. So I would—I would not like to see a material further cooling in the labor market, and\nthat’s part of what ’s behind our thinking. The other part, of course, is that we have made real\nprogress on inflation. And we’re —we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite\nthere yet, but we ’re more confident that we’re on a—that we ’re on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent. So those two things ar e working together , and we ’re factoring those both into our\npolicy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned not\nwanting to see any further cooling in the job market . Why not ? Or would you consider\npreemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling? Is that something you\nwould cut ahead of time for?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’ t say I wouldn’ t want to see any other cooling. I t would\nbe more of a material difference. If we —if we ’d be looking at this and if we see something that\nlooks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have the intention of responding to. So , in terms of—I don’ t think of it that way. I think of it as , you\nknow, we ’re actually in a good place here . We’re balancing these two risks of , you know, go too\nsoon, and you undermine progress on inf lation ; wait too long or don’ t go fast enough, and, and\nyou put at risk the recovery. And so we have to balance those two things . That’s the nature of\nhaving two mandates , and I think we —this is how we balance them. It’s a rough balance, but it\ndoes feel like, again, the labor market feels like it ’s in a place where it ’s just a process of\nongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low . And, you know, we ’ll\njust have to see what the data show us.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. And , just to follow up quickly: [I] wanted to see what\nyou thought of the recent JOLTS r eport, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down\neven below 2019 levels. Layoffs remain low . So it painted a picture of a very static labor\nmarket. Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the\ndirection we would want to see . So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job\nopenings . That was good. T oday’ s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that ’s, that’s\na good reading. I t shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level\ncontinues to come down to more sustainable levels over time. That ’s exactly the pattern that we\nwant to be seeing. So I think the data —the dat a we’ve been seeing in the labor market are\nbroadly consistent with that normalization process. Again, we ’re closely monitoring to see\nwhether it starts to show signs that it’ s more than that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked\nabout cutting rates as a process, and , in June , you talked about the idea that , well, one rate cut\nwouldn’ t do anything. So I wonder if you can sort of —follow ing up on Colby’ s question—talk\nabout , are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate\ncuts? Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut? Or a re you in the\nprocess now of thinking that rates need to be nor malized here? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I can ’t really say that, honestly. You know, we’re —we —\nwe’ve seen significant movement in the labor market , and, you know, we ’re very mindful of this\nquestion of, is it just normalization or is it more? We think it ’s just normalization, but we want\nto be in a position to, to support the labor market. At the same time , we’re seeing progress on\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ninflation. So , you know, we actually got to this —we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting .\nAnd if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment —sorry , inflation was\nover 4 percent . It was a completely different economy. Now we ’ve made a lot of progress , and\nthe labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid -3s, so it ’s a different economy . And\nI think it ’s time, it ’s coming to be time , to adjust that so that we support this continued process.\nThe thing we ’re trying to do is —you know that we have, we ’ve had this really significant\ndecline in inflation , and unemployment has remained low . And this is a really unusual and\nhistorically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve. What\nwe’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going? And this is —this is part of that.\nWe think we don’ t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ ve\nmade : 12-month headline at 2½ [percent] , core at 2.6. You know, it’ s way down from where it\nwas. The job is not done on inflation, but , nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the\nrestriction in our policy rate. And I think we’re just —it’s part of a process.\nIn terms of what that looks like, I mean , I think most rate —you would think, in a base\ncase, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’ t want to try to give specific\nforward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that ’s highly uncertain.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell. Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between? Would\nyou characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Actually , what we ’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw\nlast year. Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last\nyear was from goods pr ices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an\nunsustainable rate. This is a broader disinflation . This has goods prices coming down, but it’s\nalso—we ’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories : nonhousing services and\nhousing services. So , you know, the thing i s, we’ve only—you ’ve got one quarter of that . We\nhad seven months of low inflation ; you got one quarter of this. I would say the quality of this is ,\nis higher , and it ’s good, but so far , it’s only a quarter. So I think, you know, we need to see more\nto know that we ’re—to have more confidence that we ’re on, on a good path down to 2 percent.\nBut as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we ’ve been getting good data. And\nthings like the ECI r eport and, frankly , the softening in the labor market conditions , you know,\ngive you more confidence that the economy’ s not overheating . It doesn ’t look like an\noverheating economy, and it looks like an economy that ’s normalizing.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And if we ’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is\nthere any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate\ncuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the thing about —if what it is is seasonality , and it could just be —\nit’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments . If that’ s what it is,\nthen that actually implies that, that other months were under reporting too low inflation. I f you\nsmoothed it out, it ’s a zero -sum game. And that ’s why we look at 12 months . We look at\n12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out. Twelve -month now is\n2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core. This is so m uch better than where we were even a year\nago. It’ s a lot better. Now, t he job is not done . I want to stress that, and we ’re committed to\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ngetting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress,\nand we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more\nequally than we did a year ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. I ’d like to\nask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it. At this point, is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices? Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I—you know, I think that we ’ve been given an assignment by\nCongress . This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment\nand price stability, right? And so in our , you know, quasi -constitutional document, the Statement\non Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals , and if one of\nthem is farther away than the other—the two variables , inflation and employment— if one is\nfarther away from its goal than the other, then you , you concentrate on the one that ’s farther\naway. And you take account of the time to reach the goal.\nSo, for the last couple of years , the best service we could do to the American people was\nto focus on inflation. But as inflation has come down —and I think the upside risks to inflation\nhave decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened —you\nknow, probably the inflation, inflation ’s probably a little farther from its target than is\nemployment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are , are real now. So\nwe have to weigh all that , and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive\npolicy rate . It’s clearly restrictive. I t’s been the rate we’ ve had in place for a full year . And the\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ntime is coming —as other central banks around the world are facing the same question —the time\nis coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions , restriction\nso that we may address both mandates.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well , you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday\nand another one before you meet again. Are you certain that you won’ t fall behind the curve and\nlead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?\nCHAIR POWELL. “ Certainty ” is not a word that we have in our —in our business. So,\nyou know, we get —we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn ’t going to be one\ndata read or even two . It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just —and\nthen how is that affecting the outlook? And how is it affecting the balance of risks? That ’s\ngoing to be the assessment that we do. Of course , we’ll, we ’ll all look carefully at the\nemployment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and\nthe September meeting, and we ’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence of F ox\nBusiness. I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking. There ’s a,\na shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs. Looking at the\njob sides, we ’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing. We’ve —we’re hearing on\nearnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs. In the jobs r eport from the BLS,\ngovernment jobs has been a leading creator. Could the government jobs —as a sector —hiring\nmask underlying weakness in the jobs r eport?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , you know, we ’ll look at everything. We’ ve seen some , some\ntendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we ’ve\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nhad some months where , where job creation was broader. And also , you know, the headline\nnumber of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing. A nd I think you do look at\nprivate demand extra carefully, to your point about , about government. So we ’ll just be looking\nat, at all those things.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Just as a follow then —so could the F ed then be behind the\ncurve ? Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting , you said the reports could be\nnoisy or overstated. Was there a discussion of , of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut\ntoday, and could the F ed be “ behind the curve ”?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right? It ’s\nthe risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late. We’ve been —you know, we , we had\nseven months of good inflation data at the end of last year . We said we wanted to see more. W e\nsaid—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first\nquarter wasn ’t, wasn’t great —inflatio n data . And now we ’ve got another quarter —a quarter that\nis good. A nd, you know, we ’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too\nlate. That ’s what we ’re doing. There ’s no guarantee in this . It’s a very difficult judgment call,\nbut this is —this is how we ’re making it.\nSo—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a —you know, we had\na nice conversation about , about this issue today. The overall sense of the C ommittee, as I\nmentioned, is that we ’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial\nback restriction, but we ’re not quite at that point yet. We want to see more good data. The\ndecision was unanimous —all 19 participants supported it. B ut there was a real discussion back\nand forth of what the case would be for , for moving at this meeting. A strong majority supported\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmoving—not moving at this meeting. That was the strong sense of the C ommittee . But it’ s a\nconversation that we had today, certainly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Thank you for taking our\nquestions. When the F ed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and\nvariable lags. I wonder if that applies on the way down, too. How are you and the C ommittee\nthinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, it does. And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the\nlast six months, by the way. You , you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean , even a\nfew months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was. Look at the labor market\nnow—you can see. A nd look at inflation—sorry —rate -sensitive, interest -sensitive spending.\nYou really do see now that policy is restrictive. I wouldn’ t say it’ s extremely restrict ive, but it ’s\ncertainly effectively restrict ive. Yes , there —the lag should, should be on the way down. I t\nshould take some time to get into —to get into the full economy, a ffect financial conditions . And\nthat affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing , and, ultimately , inflation. It\ndoesn’t —it’s not instantaneous , although it ’s faster than it used to be because markets move now\nin anticipation of our moves.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long\nand variable lags, even when you’ re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the F ed to\nhelp stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. We have to worry about that. I mean, we—just to make it clear, you\nknow, it’ s a very difficult , challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’ t\nwant to go too late. But that ’s—this is how we made that judgment. I feel good about where we\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nare. We ’re certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at\n5.3 percent. We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness. That’s not\nwhat we ’re seeing , though. W hat we ’re seeing —look at the —look at the first- half growth\nnumbers . Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half. I t’s not signaling a weak economy. It ’s\nalso not signaling an overheating economy.\nLabor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate ha s moved up seven -tenths, and we ’re\nseeing —we’re seeing normalization there, but wage , wage increases are still at a high level .\nUnemployment is still at a low level. Layoffs are very low . Initial claims have moved up, but\nthey’ re pretty stable , and they’ re historically not high at all. So the total scope of the data\nsuggest s a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that\ncontinues to be the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. On the labor market, I was\nwondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the\nSahm r ule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. We—so I would just say, the question really is , is one of , are we\nworried about a sharper downturn in the labor market? So, and the answer is, we ’re watching\nreally carefully for that. We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a —I\nwould call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history. A “ statistical\nregularity ” is what I ’d call it. It’s not like an economic rule where it ’s telling you something\nmust happen.\nSo, again, what do we see? What are our eyes telling us? We look at —we look at all the\nthings we ’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market —again, job creation at a\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\npretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually. J ob\nvacancies have come down, but they ’re still high by historical standards. So, again, I ’ve been\nthrough some of the data already, but what we think we ’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor\nmarket, and we ’re watching carefully to see if it —if it turns out to be more . If it starts to show\nsigns that it ’s more than that, then we ’re well positioned to respond.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave\ndifferently this time than it has historically?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think, you know, history doesn’ t repeat itself; it rhymes. That\nstatement is very true about the economy . You never assume it ’s going to be just the same. An\nexample would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies? There are many, many\nexamples, so it ’s never exactly the same. Also, let ’s remember that this p andemic era has been\none in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted , like the inverted yield curve\nfor starters. So, many, many received —pieces of received wisdom just haven ’t worked, and it ’s\nbecause this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the\nshutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand. So the whole —the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior\ninflation or downturns that we ’ve seen or business cycles that we ’ve seen. So we ’re having to\nlearn . We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say. So\nwe don’ t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themsel ves automatically.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you, Chair Powell . Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.\nThere seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data. Do you take those anecdotes seriously—\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthat is , that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what ’s shown in\nthe data ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great. What ’s even\ngreater is hearing the R eserve B ank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with ,\nwith businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their\nDistricts. But I ’ll tell you, it’ s a pretty —the picture is , is not one of a slowing or , you know, a\nreally bad economy. I t’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth\nis stronger than other regions, but , overall, it ’s—again, look at the aggregate data. The a ggregate\ndata is—particula rly PDFP, private domestic f inal purchases —is 2.6 percent , and that ’s a good\nindicator of private —of private demand. So we listen to all of that, and it does, does —I think\nit’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data. Especially , you\nknow, it’ s very hard —GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter. So it ’s just hard to measure\neconomic activity. T here are a lot of —it’ s just difficult to do. So I look at both, but I wouldn’ t\nsay that the —that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat . It’s more mixed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Thank you. Jo Ling Kent with CBS News. Chair Powell, thanks for\ntaking our questions today. You have consistently said that the F ed does not consider politics in\nmaking decisions. With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so close to the election is something the central bank knows “ they shouldn’ t be doing.” What ’s\nyour response , and do you believe it ’s possible to r eally remain apolitical with a September rate\ncut?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. I absolutely do, and I think it ’s—first of all, we haven ’t made any\ndecisions. I would say it this way: haven ’t made any decision about any future meeting. I don’ t\nknow what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy . I really\ndon’t know. I do know how we will make that assessment. That ’s what I do know.\nSo if you take a step back, the current situation , again , is inflation has come down much\ncloser to our goal, and that ’s happened while unemployment has remained low. We’ re, we’re\nvery tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing. That’s at\neach of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing\nelse—doing our part, whatever that part may be. You know, w e’re using our best thinking.\nWe’re doing our best to understand the economy. We, we follow academics. W e follow the\nmany commentators who bless us with their commentary [laughter], but we don’ t change\nanything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar.\nCongress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all\ntimes, not just some of the time. I ’ll say this , too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a\npolitical party, a politician, or any political outcome. The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans. If we get it right, the\neconomy will be stronger . We’ll have price stability . People will find jobs . Wages will rise in\nreal terms . Everyone will benefit. So that ’s what we believe, and that ’s how we will always act.\nThis is my fourth presidential election at the F ed. I can tell you this is how we think about it.\nThis is what we do. So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nJO LING KENT. Just a quick follow -up—do your economic forecasts and models take\ninto account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris\nand Trump, and, if so, how?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. We do not do that. We absolutely do not do that. We don’ t—\nwe don’t know who’ s going to win. We don’ t know what they’ re going to do. W e don’ t act as\nthough we know , and we just can ’t do that , you know ? We basically —we have our forecast .\nWe’re not —we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to\nmake policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’ t happened yet. We would\njust—that would just be a line we would never cross. You know, w e’re a nonpolitical agency.\nWe don’ t want to be involved in any —in politics in any way, so we wouldn’ t do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicholas.\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you, Chair Powell. Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’ s\nMagazine. There hasn ’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time. If the\ndata do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September? Basically, are there meaningful differences in C ommittee members ’ assessments of how much\nmore confidence is needed?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s —there are always meaningful differences. There are.\nAnd, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting. We do have a very robust\ndiscussion of these things. You ’re right that in , in most cases , people, if they feel heard and they\nfeel that they ’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people , most\nof the time , that ’s going to be enough. There are dissents. T hat’s fine. You know, no one has a\nveto. N o single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against ?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nWe’ve had —we’ve had, you know, dissents. We haven ’t had so many during the pandemic era,\nand it just may be that we , we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get\nthings right, but before the pandemic , we had plenty of dissents. And dissents happen. It’s part\nof the process . There’s nothing wrong with dissents , and if it happens , it happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hello . Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Is a 50 basis point cut as a\nfirst cut at all likely or even on the table? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’ t want to say —I don’ t want to be really specific\nabout what we ’re going to do, but that ’s, that’s not something we ’re thinking about right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nCHAIR POWELL. Of course , we haven ’t made any decisions at all as of today.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. Not to get into the minutes , but you said there was a real discussion today for\nmoving at this meeting. I’m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the\ndiscussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so , you know, the way the meeting is set up , the first day\nthere ’s a discussion of financial stability because it ’s every other meeting we have that , and then\nwe have an opportunity to comment on that. Then we have an economic go- round. And then,\nthis morning , we have the monetary policy go -round. And I think in people ’s economic or in\ntheir monetary policy go -round, people express their views about this, and , you know, there ’s a\nrange of views. People —as you will know from the spee ches that they give —people have\ndifferent ways of thinking about the economy. And so, in the minutes , we’ll lay this out in a\nmuch—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there ’s a range of perspectives. A nd,\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nyou know —but I do think that we are, we ’re a consensus- driven organization. People come\ntogether . This was a unanimous —a unanimous decision. A nd, at the end, everyone , everyone\nsupported the outcome —not just the voters, but everyone. So I would also say, some people\nexamined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but , overwhelmingly,\nthe sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending\non how the data come in.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could\nmove at the next meeting —\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —assuming inflation comes ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , assuming that the totality of the data supports such an\noutcome. No question. That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned . We think that the time is, is—\nit’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we —that we hope we get, then a reduction in our\npolicy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op- ed in Bloomberg earlier this\nmonth, which you probably saw, in which he said, “ It might already be too late to fend off a\nrecession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk. ” Is he wrong?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the judgment that we have to make , and we ’re, we’re well\naware of the judgment. We’re—as I ’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against\nthe risk of going too late. If we go too soon, we can —we had a lot of advice , you know, to go\nahead and cut after the seven good months of last year. We didn’ t. We said we needed to see\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmore. Then we saw some higher inflation. We ’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we ’ve\nseen the labor market move quite a bit . And, as I mentioned, I don’ t think it needs to cool off\nanymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is ,\nof course. So I think it ’s a difficult judgment to make , and what you see is the judgment of the\nCommittee is that that time is drawing near. T hat time could be in September if , if the data\nsupport that.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. And have the chances of a hard landing increased?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I don’ t know whether they’ ve increased . I think they ’re low. I\nthink this is —you don’ t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply\nweakening. That’s just not in the data right now. What ’s in the data right now is an economy\nthat’s growing at a —at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but , nonetheless,\ninflation —sorry , unemployment is low . The data overall show a strong labor market. And so\nthat’s, that’s really what you see.\nIt’s not —it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.\nIt’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but , of course , the job is never done. You know,\nwe’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads . And I think we ’re—if\nwe are to respond to weakness, we ’re certainly , you know, well equipped to do that . But that ’s\nnot what we ’re seeing. What we’ re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good\nlabor market and inflation coming down.\nMICHE LLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you so much. In the —in the minutes of the June meeting that\ncame out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some F ed officials\nsaid maybe the F ed wasn ’t as clear enough about its reaction function. And , and when I talked to\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthe commentators who bless you with their comments [laughter], they say that they really don’ t\nhave a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going\nforward . They don’ t have a good sense of that. Is there anything you can say, like how will we\njudge that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean , I think the reality is that, that forecasters—and this\nisn’t just the Fed by any means —forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the\nstrength of the economy last year. So I think we had to be pretty humble about , about giving\nforward guidance about this, that, and the other thing. We need to be pretty careful about that .\nAnd, you know, when you’ re saying you’ re going to be data driven, of course , it’s always what\nthe data —how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it ’s—nobody has great vision\ndeep into the future.\nIn terms of a reaction function, that ’s a—that’s a long- time discussion that people have\nhad forever. I think people have understood for a long time , actually , that we were very focused\non bringing down inflation. N obody was really confused about that. The data have, you know —\nagain, we ’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter. Markets move\naround on that —on the data , really . Not so much —it’ s not really what we ’re going to do. I t’s\nmore just that the data keep coming in , and markets are very , very responsive to that data right\nnow.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Jeff for the last question.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ’m going to change gears on you just a little bit\nfrom all of the rate talk and whatnot. With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year,\nthere hasn ’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you\ncould give us an update on where things are with that. Is that considered a dead issue now ? Is it\n\nJuly 31, 202 4 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nstill something that ’s being discussed within the Committee , and what, what ’s happening with\nthat?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’ s not something that comes up at all with the —in the FOMC . So,\nmore broadly, digital finance is an area that ’s having—that has really significant implications for\npayments generally, instant payments. And , you know, it’ s something that’ s going to really\nchange the way —it’ s going to make more efficient and , hopefully, safer and all those things —\nthe way payments are made around the world. And so we have people who are researching that\nand trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as a convener and as an operator , too.\nIn terms of a CBDC, there ’s really nothing new going on. T here’s not much going on at\nall. We’re not —we don’ t have the authority to issue a CB—a retail CBDC that ’s available to the\npublic. We ’re not seeking that authority. So what we ’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up\nwith developments there . Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing ,\ndoing that. Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC . We’re really\nnot. We’ re really just evaluating , you know, the story and what ’s happening out there. So I\nthink it ’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we\ndon’t have —on a CBDC, we don’ t have any plan to. We would need to go to Congress , and we\nhave no plan to do that . We’re not —no one here has decided that we think it ’s a good idea yet.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you."
