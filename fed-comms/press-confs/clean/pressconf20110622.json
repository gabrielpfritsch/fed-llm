  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon and welcome.\nIn my opening remarks today, I’ll briefly revi ew today’s policy deci sion. And I’ll place\nthe decision in the context of our economic projecti ons and our policy strategy. I’ll then be glad\nto take your questions. Throughout today’s briefi ng, my goal will be to re flect the consensus of\nthe Committee while taking note of the diversity of views, as appropriate. Of course, my\nremarks and interpretations ar e my own responsibility.\nAs indicated in the policy statement rele ased earlier this afternoon, the Committee\ndecided today to keep th e target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The\nCommittee continues to anticipat e that economic conditions—inclu ding low rates of resource\nutilization and a subdued outlook for inflation in the medium run—are likely to warrant\nexceptionally low levels for the federal funds ra te for an extended period. The Committee’s\nplanned purchases of $600 billi on of longer-term Treasury secu rities will be completed by the\nend of this month, and the Committee will continue to reinvest principal payments from its\nsecurities holdings going forward.\nIn conjunction with today’s meeting, the FO MC participants submitted projections for\neconomic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and\nover the longer run. These pr ojections are conditional on ea ch participant’s individual\nassessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives. I’ll focus on the information shown in th e figures that have been distributed. In each\nfigure, the dark area denotes the central tendencie s of our current projections, while the lighter\nshaded area denotes the full range of projections . The longer-run projecti ons, shown at the right\n\nof each figure, represent participants’ assessmen ts of the rate to which each variable will\nconverge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the\neconomy.\nThe longer-run projections for output grow th have a central tendency of 2.5 to\n2.8 percent, and the longer-run projections for th e unemployment rate have a central tendency of\n5.2 to 5.6 percent—the same as in our April projec tions. These projections may be interpreted as\nindicating participants’ current es timates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its\nnormal unemployment rate over the longer run re spectively. It should be noted that these\nestimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision, because longer-run rates of economic\ngrowth and unemployment are dete rmined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over\ntime and that often cannot be directly measured.\nThe central tendency of the longer-run projectio ns for inflation, as measured by the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent. Since the longer-run inflation\noutlook is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, these projections can be interpreted as\nindicating the inflation rate that each of the participants judge to be consistent with the Federal\nReserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices. In effect, the “mandate\nconsistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.\nI now turn to the contours of the Committee’s economic outlook. As indicated in today’s\npolicy statement, the economic recovery appear s to be proceeding at a moderate pace, though\nsomewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected, and some recent labor market indicators have also been weaker than expecte d. For example, the unemployment rate has risen\nby 0.3 percentage points since March, and new cl aims for unemployment insurance have moved\nsomewhat higher.\n\nThe reduced pace of the recovery partly reflect s factors that are likely to be temporary.\nIn particular, consumers’ purchasing power ha s been damped by higher food and energy prices;\nand the aftermath of the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan has been associated with\ndisruptions in global supply chains , especially in the auto sector. However, some moderation in\ngasoline prices is now in pros pect, and the effects of the Ja panese disaster on manufacturing\noutput are likely to dissipa te in coming months.\nConsequently, as shown in the first figur e, entitled “Change in Real GDP,” the\nCommittee expects that the pace of economic r ecovery will pick up over coming quarters.\nSpecifically, participants’ projecti ons for output growth have a cen tral tendency of about 2.7 to\n2.9 percent for this year and 3.3 to 3.7 percent for next year—growt h rates faster than we have\nseen so far in 2011. However, Committee partic ipants have also generally responded to the\nrecent slowing by marking down the growth proj ections for 2011 and 2012, which are nearly a\nhalf percentage point lower th an our April projections. Looking further ahead, the central\ntendency of the growth projections for 2012—2013, sorry—is 3.5 to 4.2 percent, essentially the\nsame as in the April projections.\nAs shown in the second figure, entitled “Une mployment Rate,” the unemployment rate is\nexpected to resume its gradual decline towards le vels that the Committee j udges to be consistent\nwith this dual mandate. In particular, the une mployment rate is projected to edge down over\ncoming months to 8.6 to 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then decline gradually\nover the subsequent two years to a level of 7.0 to 7.5 percent in the four th quarter of 2013, still\nwell above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run unemployment projections. In short,\nwe expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline, but the p ace of progress remains\nfrustratingly slow.\n\nInflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some\ncommodities and imported goods. In addition, prices of motor vehicles have risen notably as a result of the recent supply chain disruptions. Howe ver, as the effects of these factors dissipate,\nthe Committee anticipates that inflation will subsid e in coming quarters to levels at or below its\nmandate-consistent rate, as shown in the figure entit led “PCE Inflation.” Specifically, the central\ntendency of participants’ inflati on projections is 2.3 to 2.5 percent for this year but declines to\n1.5 to 2.0 percent in both 2012 and 2013—a trajectory th at is broadly similar to that of our April\nprojections.\nThe economic outlook provides important policy context. In particular, the Committee’s\npolicy strategy is intended to foster both aspe cts of our dual mandate—that is, promoting the\neconomic recovery so that the unemployment rate returns over time to its longer-term normal\nlevel, and ensuring that inflati on, over time, is at levels consis tent with our mandate. At\n9.1 percent, the current unemployment rate rema ins elevated, and progress towards more normal\nlevels of unemployment is likely to be slow, as I noted. Moreover, the inflation rate, which\npicked up in recent months, is expected to subside to levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit less, that most participants judge to be most consistent with the dual mandate. The ongoing\nlabor market slack and the subdued inflati on outlook are key reasons for the Committee’s\ndecision to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation and for our judgment that exceptionally low levels of the f unds rate are likely to be warranted for an\nextended period.\nThank you. I’d be glad to take your questions. JON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, the\nFOMC says that it will maintain short-term inte rest rates at an exceptionally low level for an\n\nextended period. Does that policy—or, does that guidance also apply for the Fed’s securities\nholdings? In other words, will they be maintained at a very high level for an extended period?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We haven’t made a ny such commitment. It’s true that\nwhen we begin to allow the portfolio to run off ra ther than reinvesting, that would be a first step\nin a process of exiting from our currently highl y accommodative policies. But we’ve not yet\nchosen to make any particular commitment about the time frame. But we’ll be looking at the\noutlook and trying to assess when the appr opriate time is to take that step.\nJON HILSENRATH. If I may follow up, why give guidance on—sorry. If I may follow\nup, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on another policy tool when the\nFed has talked about those two policy tools working together?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, that’s a good qu estion. It’s something we have on the\ntable, something we’ve thought about. But to this point, we haven’ t taken that step.\nGREG IP. Mr. Chairman, the Committee lowere d not just this year’s central tendency\nforecast but also 2012 . And yet, the statement of the Comm ittee attributes mo st of the revision\nforecast to temporary factors. So I was w ondering if you could explain what seems to be\npersisting in terms of hol ding the recovery back. I did see the statement says, “in part” to factors\nthat are likely to be temporary. Are there mo re permanent factors that are producing a worse\noutlook than three months ago?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as you—as you point out, what we say is that the\ntemporary factors are “in part” the reason for the slowdown. In other words, part of the\nslowdown is temporary, and part of it may be longe r lasting. We do believe that growth is going\nto pick up going into 2012 but at a somewhat slower pace from—than we had anticipated in\nApril. We don’t have a preci se read on why this slower pa ce of growth is persisting.\n\nOne way to think about it is that maybe some of the headwinds that have been concerning\nus, like, you know, weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance\nsheet and deleveraging issues—some of these headwi nds may be stronger or more persistent than\nwe thought. And I think it’s an appropriate balance to attribut e a slowdown partly to these\nidentifiable temporary factors bu t to acknowledge a possibility that some of the slowdown is due\nto factors which are longer lived and which will be still operative by next year. You note that, in\n2013, we have growth at about the same ra te that we anticipated in April.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, could you desc ribe to what extent the situation in\nGreece and Europe was discussed at the meeting and what policy conclusions were reached?\nAnd also could you tell us whether or not, in response to the recent slowdown, there was a\ndiscussion about further easing?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, with resp ect to Greece, that’s obviously very\nimportant. That—it’s a very difficult situati on. We’ve been in close communication with our\ncolleagues in Europe—obviously not part of the negotiations, but we’ve been kept well\ninformed. We had a G-7 call over the weekend, for example. I think the Europeans appreciate\nthe incredible importance of resolv ing the Greek situation. If there were a failure to resolve that\nsituation, it would pose threats to the European financial system, the global financial system, and\nto European political unity, I woul d conjecture as well. So, yes, we did discuss it. It’s one of\nseveral potential financial risks th at we’re facing now. But, agai n, we are mostly just following\nthe—the situation closely and making sure that, as best we can, that our own institutions are well positioned relative to sovereign debt in the so-called peripheral countries.\nWith respect to additional a sset purchases, we haven’t take n any action, obviously, today.\nWe’ll be reviewing the outlook going forward. It will be a Committee decision. I think the point\n\nI would make, though, in terms of where we are t oday versus where we were, say, in August of\nlast year when I began to talk a bout asset purchases, is that at that time, inflation was very low\nand falling. Many objective indicators suggested that deflation was a nontrivial risk. And I think\nthat the securities purchases have been very suc cessful in eliminating defl ation risk. I don’t think\npeople appreciate necessarily that deflation can be a very pern icious situation where it could\nhave very long-lasting eff ects on economic growth.\nIn addition, growth in payrolls has actually picked up. In the four months before the\nJackson Hole speech in August, there was about an 80,000 per month payroll increase. So far in\n2011, including the weak payroll re port in May, the average is cl oser to 180,000. So there has\nbeen improvement in the labor market, albeit not as strong as we would like . As of last August,\nwe were essentially missing significantly in bo th—on both sides of our mandate. Inflation was\ntoo low and falling, and unemployment looked like it might be even beginning to rise again. In\nthat case, the case for monetary action was pretty clear in my mind. I think we are in a different\nposition today—certainly not where we’d like to be, but closer to the dual-mandate objectives\nthan we were at that time. So, again, the situat ion is different today than last August, but we’ll\ncontinue to monitor the ec onomy and act as needed.\nLUCA DILEO. Luca DiLeo, Dow Jones. Would budget cuts, which may begin at the\nend of this year, help or hinde r the economy? This goes back to the other question: What’s\nfiscal policy like in the 2012 growth forecast?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The effect of fis cal cuts on the economy depends very much\non the timing. I’ve advocated th at the negotiations about the budget focus on the longer term,\nsay, 10 years, which is the budget window, or ev en longer if you’re taking into account\nentitlement reform, for example. By taking a lo ng-run perspective, we can help the economy by\n\nreducing the risk that interest ra tes might rise suddenly. We may help increase confidence in the\npart of households and businesses. And so I think it’s very desirable that we take strong action to\nlower our budget deficits over the longer term.\nIn doing that, I think it would be best not t o—in light of the weakness of the recovery, it\nwould be best not to have sudden and sharp fiscal consolidation in the very near term. That\ndoesn’t do so much for the long-run budget situation. It just is a negative for growth. So my\nanswer is that it depends very much on the timi ng, and I hope that the co ngressional negotiators\nwill take a longer-term view as th ey—as they discuss the issue.\nDARREN GERSH. Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report on PBS. If I could\nfollow up on what he just said, there seems to be a growing view in the coun try that the deficit is\nthe problem with jobs, and that immediate cuts in the defi cit would grow the economy and\nimmediately create jobs. Many eco nomists disagree with that. Do you want to go a little further\nand maybe talk about that issue, and whether you agree with that view that seems to be taking\nroot?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’t think that sharp, immediate cuts in the deficit would\ncreate more jobs. I think in the very short r un that we are seeing already a certain amount of\nfiscal drag coming from state and local governments, as well as from the withdrawal of previous\nfederal stimulus. So I think in the very short run that , you know, the fiscal tightening is—is, at\nbest, neutral but probably somewh at negative for job creation.\nI think what people will understand, should understand, is that our budgetary problems\nare very long run in nature. The projections made by the CBO, for example, talk about where\nour debt-to-GDP ratio will be in 2020, 2025, and so on. That doesn’t mean we should wait to act. The sooner we can act, the better. But th e most efficient and effective way to address our\n\nfiscal problems—and, again, I think this is extremely important—is to take a longer-run\nperspective, not to focus the cuts heavily on th e near term. But by taking a long-run perspective\nand making a credible plan for reducing future defi cits, we’ll lower interest rates, or at least\nprevent them from rising, and we w ill increase confidence. And that could be very constructive.\nBut if it’s entirely focused on the near term, I don’t think that’s the optimal way to proceed.\nNEIL IRWIN. Mr. Chairman, Neil Irwin with the Washington Post . Do you believe that\nthe FOMC has the authority to set a, say, 2 per cent inflation target on its own, unilaterally, or do\nyou believe that it would need to go to Congress to get that target made more explicit? If the\nformer, are you considering doing it ? If the latter, ar e you considering going to Congress to ask\nthem to do it?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, Neil, as you know, I’ve been a long-time proponent\nof an inflation target. I think that it would help an chor inflation expectat ions; it would make it\neasier to reach our inflation objec tive. At the same time, it’s not at all inconsistent with our\nemployment objective because keep ing inflation low and stable, k eeping inflation expectations\nlow and stable, actually gives th e Fed more leeway to respond to short-term shocks to the\neconomy. So I think it’s something, you know, that is worth considering.\nIn terms of authorities, I w ould just say that there are multiple models around the world.\nSo, for example, in the European Central Bank, that bank has a mandate for price stability,\nperiod. And they set their own definition of that using input from economists and others. So I\ndon’t think there’s a real barrier to setting a target. However, it is very important that, first, that\nwe communicate to the public what we’re doing. Without sufficient explanation and\nbackground, many people might think that we were somehow abandoning our employment\ntarget. So we need to make sure that that’s well understood both by the public and by Congress\n\nthat having a target would not mean that we we re abandoning the other le g of the dual mandate.\nAlso, you asked about consulting with Congress. I think under any circumstances, it would be\nimportant to take the pulse of Congress. They—w e might have the legal au thority to do this, but\nI think we do need some buy-in from the Administ ration and Congress to take that step. We are\ncontinuing to periodically discuss this issue. It’s been part of our ongoing communications\ndiscussion, which included this press conferen ce as one innovation, for example. There’s\nnothing imminent. But, again, we’ll continue to discuss this, and, as appropriate, we’ll be\nconsulting about it.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . What is your\nassessment of the impact on the United States ec onomy if there is a default by one or more\nEuropean nations? What steps has the Fed taken to assess the consequences for American\nfinancial institutions? And, in particular, have you examined the impact on derivatives holdings\noutside of the regulated financial system?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, to answer yo ur second question first, we have been\nvery assiduous in examining the exposures of fi nancial institutions to the so-called peripheral\ncountries. The answer is that the banks that we regulate are not si gnificantly exposed to—to\nthose countries directly, at least. They have significant exposures to European banks in the\nnonperipheral countries, and so indi rectly, they have that exposu re. The—and that statement\nwhich I just made includes credit default swap s and so on. The gross numbers that the BIS\npublishes do not fully account for a wide variet y of hedges and other positions. So we have\nasked the banks to essentially do stress tests and ask, looking at all their positions, all their\nhedges, What would the effect on their capital be if Greece defaulted? And the answer is that the\neffects are very small.\n\nIt’s also the case that—well, we don’t oversee the money market mutual funds. We have\nbeen keeping a close eye on that si tuation. There again, the situation is similar in some sense, in\nthat except—with very few exceptions, the money market mutual funds don’t have much direct\nexposure to the three peripheral c ountries which are currently deali ng with debt pr oblems. They\ndo have very substantial exposure to European ba nks in the so-called co re countries: Germany,\nFrance, et cetera. So to the extent that ther e is indirect impact on—on the core European banks,\nthat does pose some concern to money market mutual funds and is a reason why the Federal\nReserve and other regulators are co ntinuing to look at ways to st rengthen money market mutual\nfunds.\nIn terms of the impact of the problem in Greece on the United States, as I’ve indicated,\nthe direct exposures are pretty small, and we’re doing all we can to monitor those exposures.\nHowever, as we saw in a small situation, a small case last spring, a disorderly default in one of\nthose countries would no doubt ro il financial markets globally. It would have a big impact on\ncredit spreads, on stock prices, and so on. And so, in that respect, I think the effects on the\nUnited States would be quite significant.\nDONNA BORAK. Mr. Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker . To talk\nabout—further about banks, as you know, global regu lators are meeting this week to finalize a\nproposal that would name the worl d’s most significantly banks and as well as a surcharge. There\nare some that are arguing that regulators are going too far, too fast. And I’m wondering, for\nregulators, you know, where is the line wher e you—to pass, where you go too far, and you do\nhurt credit lending and inevitably hurt the economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So I’ll be attending that meeting, and so I’ll have a chance\nto hear others’ views and to contribute to that discussion. It’s only been two years since we had\n\nthe worst financial crisis certainly since the Gr eat Depression and possibly in the history of the\nUnited States. And the failure or near failure of large financial institutions was a major\ncontributor to that cris is. Since we can’t know exactly what threats will come in the future,\nprobably the best all-purpose wa y of strengthening the balanc e sheets of banks and other\nfinancial institutions is by capital. And I’m very supportive of increased capital to—and better\nquality capital—to help ensure that these banks w ill be stable and able to lend in the event of\nanother crisis, which I hope we don’t, of course, ever see.\nIn terms of the SIFI surcharge, so-called, I think it’s also appropriate to have additional\ncapital requirements for the largest and most syst emically important institutions. After all, it’s\nbecause their failure would have very deleterious e ffects in the financial system, we need to take\nextra steps to make sure that th ey will be very unlikely to fa il. In addition, it provides some\nmore level playing field because, by having higher equity requirements, the largest institutions\navoid some of the funding advantages that would otherwise accrue to firms that are viewed as\nbeing too big to fail. So I think it’s very important to do that. And we’ll be negotiating,\ndiscussing with our collea gues internationally what the appropr iate number of fi rms is, what the\nappropriate criteria are, and what the amount of capital s hould be. In choosing the amount of\ncapital, we will certainly be trying to weigh off and balance, on the one hand, the need for extra\nsafety of systemically important firms agai nst the impacts on lending and so on. Although I\nwould note that, since systemically important fi rms are only part of the banking system, to the\nextent that they reduce their lending, some of that lending might go to other institutions.\nIn terms of going too far, you know, it’s ver y, very difficult to make a broad-based\nassessment of the overall impact of all of the rules and regulations. Bu t I would like to make\nclear that, both by law and by our internal pr actices, the Federal Reserve does cost-benefit\n\nanalysis of every rule that we write, and we publis h those. So we are looking at the cost-benefit\nfor these regulations. Moreover, we have wo rked with—the Federal Reserve has worked\nactively with the BIS, the Basel Committee, to do analyses of the effects of capital requirements,\non the one hand, on the probability of a crisis, a nd on the other hand, on the cost of lending and\nthe effect on growth. Those studies have b een published. And if you look at them, you’ll see\nthat we believe that the capital which has been imposed so far would significantly reduce the\nthreat of a massive financial crisis and, on the ot her hand, have very small effects on growth. So\nI don’t think we’re on the wrong side of that tradeoff at this point.\nROBIN HARDING. Robi n Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, you now\nexpect that both headline and core inflati on would be close to your long-run objective in 2012\nand 2013 while unemployment remains high. Does that mean you think the medium-term tradeoff between inflation and growth has got worse? And, furthermore, can I ask—Has the\nunexpected rise in core infla tion changed your understanding of the output gap? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, to address the la tter question first, th at’s a possibility.\nAs you saw from the—but as you saw from the projections we just put out, the Committee—\nevery member of the Committee sees the long -run unemployment rate—the NAIRU, as it’s\ncalled by economists—somewhere around 5½ percent, ba sically. So that would suggest that the\nCommittee still believes that the output gap is quit e large. With respect to core inflation, some\nof the effects, at leas t there, are also temporary. To name two examples, the supply chain\ndisruptions brought about by the Japa nese disaster have led to a ve ry significant increase in auto\nprices, both new and used automobiles, last month. As these problems are resolved—and they\nappear to be very much on the way to being re solved—we would assume that the auto prices\nwould come back down and incentives would be re stored as competition increases and costs are\n\nreduced. So that’s one example. Another woul d be the fact that en ergy prices have passed\nthrough to a number of—despite th e fact that core is defined excluding energy, that’s only the\nenergy, direct energy products—things like airfares, for example, which are very sensitive to the\ncost of jet fuel, are also a part of the core. So you would imagine that , as the price of oil\ndeclines, that you would see some bounce—dec line in, also in—in the core measures of\ninflation. So given that there’s still a large output gap, given that inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored, given that some of the temporar y factors affecting infl ation, including core\ninflation, are likely to recede, I think it’s reasona ble to think that core inflation will fall back\ntowards mandate-consistent levels . That being said, I think it ’s the case, if you look at the\nprojections that we have marked up a little bit, the near-term and core projections.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, what is\nthe extended period right now for exceptionally low fed funds rate—rat es, given the recent\ndevelopments in the U.S. and global economic pict ure? Is it a year or two? And under what\nconditions would the extended period be extended even longer? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, you know, th e reason we use terms like “extended\nperiod” is not to be intentiona lly opaque. The reason is that we don’t know exactly how long. I\nthink the—I think the thrust of “ex tended period” is that we belie ve we’re at leas t two or three\nmeetings away from taking any further acti on, and I emphasize “at l east.” But depending on\nhow the economy evolves, and inflation and unemployment, it could be, you know, significantly\nlonger. It will depend on how the economy and the economic outlook changes. If we do get both improved job creation and inflation close to our—close to or even above our mandate-\nconsistent level, then that would be a sign that we need to consid er beginning an exit process.\nBut we’re not there at this point.\n\nPETER BARNES. But what about negative co nditions—for example, the situation in\nEurope becoming a contagion situation?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, if the ec onomy worsens and inflation remains\nrelatively low, then we wouldn’t begin to exit, and, therefore, we wouldn’t change the language.\nThe expected length of keeping rates low would th en be longer, but, again, we wouldn’t want to\ngive explicit—we could, I suppose, but we have at le ast not chosen so far to give an explicit time\nframe, again because it’s our intention to continue to monitor the economy, revise our outlook—we just revised our outlook fairly significantl y since April—and make a judgment based on the\nincoming data. So we don’t want to commit our selves necessarily to a fixed—a fixed time\nframe.\nCRAIG TORRES. Mr. Chairman, Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Cool fan charts.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. CRAIG TORRES. So, all of you have to make policy projections on appropriate policy.\nSo to get to this world of 2013, when we have above-trend growth and unemployment falling\nand inflation at a really nice level, what would your appropriate policy be to get there? Would it\nbe an early gradual exit, a la te steep exit, or no exit?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I don’t think it would be constructive for me to give\nyou a tentative projection because, obviously, as I’v e indicated, there’s simply no alternative but\nto watch the incoming data and to make judgments both in terms of when the exit should begin,\nwhich, at this point, is going to depend on inco ming data, but also what the slope of tightening\nwould be, how quickly we would tighten. So, you know, we all have estimates in our minds, but,\nyou know, that’s a very far cry from saying that th is is what’s going to happen. In a sense, the\nFOMC has to forecast its own behavior in th e same way it forecasts the economy. And that\n\nforecast can change. And given developmen ts in the economy, we might end up doing\nsomething different than what we currently think is most likely.\nKEVIN HALL. Kevin Hall of McClatchy News papers. If I understand correctly, unlike\nyour predecessor, you’re actually bringing your own forecast to the FOMC meeting. As a first\namong equals, how did you fall in the central te ndency? Were you among the three that were\nexcluded on the high end or the low end? A nd on the range—where would you put yourself on\nthe range of the forecasts as a first among equals? And as a side note, I don’t think your\npredecessor did this. Why did—what benefits do you get by bringing your own forecast? And\nthe—your predecessor made headlines recently, s uggesting that we should urgently move back\nto the Clinton-era tax levels be cause of how bad the debt situa tion could get. Without getting\ninto the area of Congress, what they should or sh ouldn’t do, what would be the benefits or costs\nof moving back to a 1999 3 pe rcentage point change in the marginal tax rates?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, in your firs t question, I’m a member of the FOMC,\nand so I have submitted my own forecasts. I think I would characterize me as—myself as being\npretty consistent with most of my colleagues. I certainly am not taking an outsized extreme view\nin any way. And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdow n is at least partly\ntemporary, and that we’ll see grea ter growth going forward. At the same time, I did—I do think\nthat, given that we can’t explain the entire slowdown, that the best guess would be that growth, at\nleast in the near term, might be a li ttle bit less than we anticipated.\nOn tax policy, you know, I think the main poi nt I’d like to make—and as you know, I’m\nreluctant to get into specifics of tax and spendi ng policy—the main point I’d like to make is that\nwe do need very seriously and urgently to addr ess the overall fiscal situation, in particular by\ntaking a long-run perspective to do that. Exactly how that’s done is really the responsibility of\n\nCongress because there are different tradeoffs fr om different choices. And, of course, those\nchoices also reflect fundament al values in what—about what you think the government should\ndo, how much resources the govern ment should command through taxes, and so on. So I don’t\ngenerally make recommendations about specifics. But I do think, in my role as someone who’s\nextremely interested in financ ial stability, that addressing th e medium- to long-term deficit\nproblem is very urgent.\nMICHELLE FLEURY. Michelle Fleury, BBC News. Looking at your unemployment\nprojections, it seems you expect weak growt h—weak jobs growth going forward and then a\nreturn to normal, sort of, in the long run. Does this mean, th en, you don’t expect that there’s a\nstructural issue here? And, if not, can you sort of give us a time frame for sort of in the long run,\nwhen we return to normal?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we expect —as the projections show, we expect\ngrowth in the second half of this y ear and next year to be certainly faster than it’s been so far in\n2011. And as a result, we would expect to see healthier job creation nu mbers. So we should\nsee—if our forecast is correct , we’ll see payroll numbers improving relatively soon.\nIn terms of the unemployment rate, though, gi ven that growth is not much above the\nlong-run potential rate of growth—and we ha ve in our projections an estimate of\n2.5 to 2.8 percent, we haven’t really done much better than that—it take s growth faster than\npotential to bring down unemployment. And since we’re not getting that, we project\nunemployment to come down very painfully slowl y. At some point, if growth picks up as we\nanticipate, job numbers will start getting bette r. We’re still some years away from full\nemployment in the sense of 5½ percent, say, and that’s, of course, very frustrating because it\n\nmeans that many people will be out of work for a very extended time. And that can have\nsignificant long-term consequences that concern me very much.\nMARK FELSENTHAL. Mark Felsenthal , with Reuters. Mr. Chairman, given your\nresponse just now, and given the Fed’s belief that the recent uptick inflation is transitory, why\nwouldn’t the Fed consider taking more action to st imulate growth? And if it would consider that,\nwould bond purchases be your preference, or woul d communications tactics, such as the one\nsuggested by Jon, also be on the table as you cons ider how to get the eco nomy growing again?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, there are a couple of considerations. One, as I\nindicated before, is that the current outlook is si gnificantly different than what we were facing\nin—in August of last year. We no longer have a deflation risk. Infl ation is above—at the\nmoment, is above target. We expect it to fall, but we’re no longer— certainly not in any\ndeflationary situation. And notwithstanding th e disappointing news recently, the labor market\nhas been performing better than it was last year. On top of th at, we have an awful lot of\nuncertainty right now about how much of this sl owdown is temporary, how much is permanent.\nSo that would suggest, all else equa l, that a little bit of time to see what’s going to happen is—it\nwould be useful in making policy decisions. We ’ll continue to look at the outlook and act, you\nknow, as appropriately as the news comes in a nd the projections change. We do have a number\nof ways of acting; none of them are without ri sks or costs. We could, for example, do more\nsecurities purchases and structur e them in different ways. We could cut the interest on excess\nreserves that we pay to banks. And as was suggested by an earlier question—several earlier\nquestions, actually—Jon’s question about givi ng guidance on the balance sheet or by perhaps\neven giving a fixed date, you know, to define “exte nded period,” those are ways that we could\n\nease further if needed. But, of course, all of these things are so mewhat untested. They have their\nown costs. But we’d be prepared to take ad ditional action, obviously, if conditions warranted.\nAKIHIRO OKADA. Mr. Chairma n, I am Akihiro Okada with Yomiuri Shimbun , a\nJapanese newspaper. During the Japanese lo st decade in the 1990s, you strongly criticized\nJapan’s lack of policies. Recently Larry Summers suggested in his column that the U.S. is in the\nmiddle of its own lost decade. Based on thos e points with QE2 ending, what do you think of\nJapan’s experience and the reality facing the U.S.? Are there any historical lessons that we should be reminded about? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I’m a little bi t more sympathetic to central bankers\nnow than I was 10 years ago. I think it’s very important to understand that in my comments—\nboth in my comment in the published comment a decade ago as well as in my speech in 2002 about deflation—my main point was that a determined central bank can always do something\nabout deflation. After all, infl ation is a monetary phenomenon, a central bank can always create\nmoney, and so on. I also argued—and I think it ’s well understood that deflation, persistent\ndeflation can be a very debilita ting factor in—in growth and empl oyment in an economy. So we\nacted on that advice here in the Un ited States, as I just described, in August, September of last\nyear. We could infer from, say, TIPS prices —inflation index bond pri ces—that investors saw\nsomething on the order of a one-third chance of outright deflation going forward. So there was a\nsignificant risk there. The securities purchases that we did were intended, in part, to end that risk\nof deflation. And I think it’s widely agreed th at we succeeded in ending that deflation risk. I\nthink also that our policies were constructive on the employment si de. This, I realize, is a bit\nmore controversial. But we did take actions as needed, even though we were at the zero lower\n\nbound of interest rates, to address deflation. So that was the thrust of my remarks 10 years ago.\nAnd we’ve been consistent with that—with that approach.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckne r, Market News International. Do you\nand your colleagues have a statistical trigger of any sorts, say, a particular level of\nunemployment or inflation at which you would be gin the exit process? If you do, wouldn’t it\nmake sense to announce it? If not, why not?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it ’s pretty impossible to create a statistical trigger\nbecause we have currently 17 independent memb ers of the FOMC. Each has his or her own\nview on the outlook, on the efficacy of monetary policy, and on the risks to inflation and\nunemployment. So we don’t have any such form ula. We have staff produce, you know, various\nscenarios, which give some i ndication of—given their projections of where the most likely\noutcomes, most likely points for a beginning of an exit would be. But as I said earlier when I\nwas asked about my own projections, those are very tentative, depend on a lot happening, depend\non the forecasts evolving as expected, and are cer tainly subject to change as new information\ncomes in.\nDEREK KRAVITZ. Derek Kravit z, Associated Press. On your point about permanent\nfactors, housing, back in February—actually, November, you had said that a second asset—a\nsecond round of asset purchases would go ahead and ease mortgage ra tes and make housing\nmore affordable. You’ve seen housing become mo re affordable; you’ve seen rates decline. But\nyou’re seeing underlying fundamentals in the sector still very weak—starts, sales, and prices.\nMany economists have pushed back any and all economic forecasts for the sector to 2013–2014 for any meaningful rebound. What could be done for that sector as far as—to stimulate growth?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the housing sector is very important to the overall\nrecovery, and so we’ve paid a lot of attention to that. We did—as you point out, we did succeed\nin significantly lowering the mortgage rates. So those who can get credit, together with the low\nprices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.\nUnfortunately, there are problems, including th e fact that credit standards for mortgages\nhave tightened quite considerably so that roughly a bottom—the bottom third of people who\nmight have qualified for a prime mortgage in te rms of, say, FICO scores a few years ago cannot\nqualify today. So that’s—that’s ce rtainly an important problem. Th ere’s also evidently a lot of\nuncertainty about employment, about the econo mic recovery, and that’s affecting people’s\nwillingness to make the commitment to buy a hou se. So there are a number of fundamental\nfactors which are slowing th e housing market down, and th ey do present very difficult\nchallenges. The Fed is trying to address this in a number of ways. Of course, our monetary\npolicy is intended to try to promote employment and income gains, which, of course, will help\nhousing demand. As regulators, we have recently issued cease-and- desist orders to servicers to\ntry and improve servicing practices. We work with our regulated banks to ask them to do\nmodifications where appropriate and to manage th eir REO—real estate owned—real estate in an\neconomy-supportive way.\nWe’ve also—the Federal Reserve has also be en very much involved in giving input to\nother agencies which have res ponsibilities for housing. For exampl e, we have provided advice to\nthe Treasury on their modificati on programs. In fact, I am—ex officio, I am the head of the\noversight board for the TARP, which is—now mos tly consists of HAMP, the housing program.\nSo, in that context, I’m kept well informed. So the Federal Reserve is doing a lot and doing what\nit can. I think otherw ise I’d like to see just further efforts to—first of all, to modify loans where\n\nappropriate; to—and where not appr opriate, to speed the process of foreclosure and disposition\nof the foreclosed homes in order to clear the market; get these homes out of the pipeline; and\nallow people to, you know, to operate in a market where they’re more confident that prices will\nbe stable rather than falling. It’s inte resting now that—although house prices overall are\ndeclining, all of that is concentr ated in distressed properties; th at is, houses which are not being\nsold on a distressed basis have much more stab le prices than those wh ich are being sold on a\ndistressed basis. And that suggests that, if we can reduce the current number and something of\nmore than a third, maybe 40 percent of home sale s which are on a distressed basis, that would do\na lot to stabilizing the market and helping give people confidence that they can buy, and not be\nbuying into a falling market.\nThank you very much."
