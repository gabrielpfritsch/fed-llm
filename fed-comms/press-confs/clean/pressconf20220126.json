  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy\ninterest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The Committee also agreed to co ntinue reducing its net asset purchases on the\nschedule we announced in December —bringing them to an end in early March. As I will\nexplain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving ec onomic environment, and it will continue to do so.\nEconomic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations\nand the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of house holds and businesses. Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and\nresilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High -frequ ency\nindicators point to reduced spending in COVID -sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.\nAnd activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs.\nFortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent\nas previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a ret urn to strong growth.\nThat said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain. And we have not lost sight of the\n\nfact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health -care workers on the front\nlines, the virus continues to cause great hardship.\nThe labor market has made remarkable progress and , by many measures, is very strong.\nJob gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three\nmonths. Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.\nLabor demand remains historically strong. With constraints on labor supply, employers\nare having difficulties filling job openings , and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many\nyears. While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the\naging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who would otherwise would be\nseeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of f actors related to the\npandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave\nof the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time , there are good reasons to expect some\nfurther improvements in participation and empl oyment.\nInflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent. Supply and demand\nimbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to\ncontribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus.\n\nWhile the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the\ndislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of\ngoods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year.\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and tha t will require price stability. We are committed to our price -stability goal.\nWe will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. And we ’ll be watching carefully to see wh ether the\neconomy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the fed eral funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in\nDecember, to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we’ ve seen\nin the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer -run goal, the economy\nno longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\nOf course, the economic outlook remai ns highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary\npolicy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in\n\nunexpected ways. We ’ll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible\noutcomes. With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high\ninflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals.\nTo provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Fe deral\nReserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions. [In] these high- level principles , [we] clarify that the federal\nfunds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary po licy and that reducing our balance sheet\nwill occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet . Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample -\nreserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury\nsecurities.\nOur decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum -employment\nand price -stability goals. In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our\napproach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments. The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of\nshrinking the balance sheet . And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and\nprovide additional information at the appropriate time.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -\nstability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questi ons.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the first question, we ’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the\nAssociated Press.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thanks, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. So it ’s\nexpected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting , but certainly in the past, the\nFed has hiked at every meeting. So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive\nmeetings on the table this year? Is every meeting a live —a live meeting? And, on that note,\nwould the F ed consider f ront-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn ’t raise at every\nmeeting? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So , as I —as I referred to in my opening statement, it ’s—it\nis not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to\nprove appropriate. And so, at this time, we haven’ t made any decisions about the path of policy.\nAnd I stress again that we’ ll be humble and nimble. We’ re going to have to navigate\ncrosscurrents and actually two -sided risks now. So—and, and I ’ll say also that we ’re going to be\nguided by the data. In fact, what I ’ll say is that we’ re going to be led by the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook, which we ’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and\ntransparency —tran sparently.\nSo more to your question, w e know that the economy is in a very different place than it\nwas when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The\nlabor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher\nthan it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the\nappropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven ’t made any decisions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you were talking about the\nhealth of the labor market. And I ’m curious whether you would characterize where we ’re at\nright now as maximum employment . And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes\n[are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control\nwithout hurting jobs and wages?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorr y. Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.\nSo I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee —that both sides of the mandate\nare calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in\nplace during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the\npandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are\nconsistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employ ment that is\nconsistent with price stability. And that is —that is my personal view. And, and, again, very\nbroad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate.\nThe other thi ng is , maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the\ncourse of the business cycle. In the particular situation we ’re in now, it may well increase .\nMax—the level of maximum—of employment that ’s consistent with stable prices may increase.\nAnd we hope that it will , as more people come back into the labor market, as participation\ngradually rises. And the policy path that we ’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of\nthat comment—that outcom e as well.\nSo the thing about the labor market right now is that there are —there are many millions\nof, of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can—\nwhether we can raise rates and , and move to less accommodative , and eve n tight , financial\n\nconditions without hurting the labor market. I think there ’s quite a bit of room to raise interest\nrates without threatening the labor market. This is, by so many measures, a historically tight\nlabor market . Record levels of job openi ngs, of quits. Wages are moving up at the highest pace\nthey have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful. Look at\nsurveys of companies —they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels, really ,\nthat we ha ven’t seen in a long time —and, in some cases, ever. So this is a very, very strong\nlabor market , and my strong sense is that we can —we can —we can move rates up without ,\nwithout having to, you know, severely undermine it.\nI also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which\nshould also help bring down inflation, w e hope , including improvement on the supply side,\nwhich will ultimately come . The timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is\ngoing to be less supportive of , of growth this year —not of the level of economic activity , but the\nfiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces —which should\nbe working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing\nand pace of that are , are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we —than\nwe thought. And, of course, we ’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does\nnot be come entrenched.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street\nJournal. I , I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. The stateme nt on the balance sheet\ntoday calls for “significantly reducing ” your holdings. What does that mean? And then, apart\nfrom moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And, finally, how much\n\ndisagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than\npassive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’ re\nquestions that the Committee is just turning to now. So we had—we had a discussion, as you\nknow, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues. At this meeting, we ’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a\nhigh level. And those are meant to gui de the actual decisions we’ ll make about the pace and\nabout all of the questions that you ’re, you’re asking.\nAnd I expect that this process will , will be something that we spen d time on in coming\nmeetings. I can ’t tell you how many. I can ’t tell you how long it will take. But —and then, you\nknow, at the appropriate time, we ’ll provide additional information. So I did—the last cycle\nwhen we —when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over , over the course of\ntwo or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.\nSo we ’re just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we ’ll be turning to, you know, more\nof the details that you ’re—that you’re asking about.\nI would say this. The balance sheet is, is much bigger. I ’d say it has a shorter duration\nthan the last time. And the economy ’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So —and I\nthink that leads you to— and I said , I’ve said this —being willing to move sooner than we did the\nlast time and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it ’s really —it’s really not appropriate for me\nto speculate exactly what that would be. And , and—but I would point you to principle number\none, which is “ the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.” So we do want the federal funds\nrate—we , we want to operationalize that [as the primary means] . And we want the bala nce sheet\n\nto be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting\nreinvestments.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance\nsheet both restrain the economy, both tighten mone tary policy. How should we think about the\nrelationship between the two? For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every\n¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, we think of the balance sheet as , as moving in a\npredictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it ’s the federal funds rate. There are—there are rules of thumb —I’m reluctant to\nland on one of them —that , that equate this. And —but there ’s also an element of , of uncertainty\naround the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions. Balance sheet [policy] is , is still a\nrelatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’ re less certain about that.\nSo, again, our —I think our —the pattern we ’ll follow is to —is to arrive at a, you know, a\ntiming and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will— it will start in the background. And then we ’ll look to have that just\nrunning in the background and have —and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of\nmonetary policy. That ’s, that’s at least the plan. I can ’t tell you much more about any of the —\nany of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things. But w e’ll be\nturning to all of those at coming meetings.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Now we ’ll go to Neil Irwin.\n\nNEIL IRWIN. Thank you, Chair Powell. It ’s Neil Irwin from Axios. Glad to be back.\nSir, I was wondering if the volatility we ’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes\nyou as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy. Conversely, to the degree\nthat financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your tightening goals?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real\neconomy: maximum employment and price stability. And financial conditions matter to the\nextent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we ,\nwe look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what\nwe’re always asking ourselve s is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material\nenough that —of a change in financial conditions —that they are inconsistent with the\nachievement of our goals? So that ’s how we ’re looking at that. And I don’ t want to comment on\ntoday’ s financial conditions broadly, but we ’re not looking at any one market or , or so. So that ’s\nhow we ’re thinking.\nIn terms of what we ’ve seen, I would say this. We, you know, we said at our last meeting\nwe published the Summary of E conomic P rojections, the me dian of which—the median\nparticipant expected three rate increases this year. And, you know, it ’s six weeks, seven weeks\nlater now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working. Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases. Surveys show that market\nparticipants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time ,\nsometime later this year perhaps. We haven ’t made that decision yet. So we , we feel like the\ncommunications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and\n\nthat financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make. And monetary\npolicy works significantly through expectations. So that , that in and of itself is appropria te.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Howard Schneider.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. You know, for a year or so—Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell.\nHoward Schneider with Reuters. So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase. Now that we ’re approaching that moment, what are the\nbenchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases? I know you can’ t stipulate the path, but\nhow s hould we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you’ re right. We haven ’t got—we haven ’t gotten to that point\nyet. We haven ’t made a decision yet, and we ’ll make that decision at the March meeting. We’ ll\nmake a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate. I would say that the Committee is , is of a\nmind to , to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are\nappropriate for doing so. We have— we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the\nworld. But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that\nshould be temporary. And we think that the economy should —the underlying strength of the\neconomy should, you know, should, should—show thr ough fairly quickly after that.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow just on a related question, the December\nSEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of n eutral. Given developments since then, do\nyou still think that ’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the p ath is highly uncertain and that we ’re committed to using\nour tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we ’re seeing , does not become\nentrenched. So a number of factors would be —it’s not just monetary policy —a number of\n\nfactors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned. Fiscal policy will be —will provid e\nsignificantly less of an impulse to growth. We do expect this year —although we do expect now\nthat it will come slower than , than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the\nsupply side. So that, too, should—should lower the supply- side barriers, which are a big pa rt of\nthe story of why inflation is high. I n addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly\nless accommodative.\nSo the question is —you know, we ’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that\nwill be , are things turning out as we expec t? There ’s a case that, for whatever reason, the\neconomy slows more and inflation slows more than expected ; we’ll react to that. If, instead, we\nsee inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we ’ll react to that. And, again,\nwe’re, we’ re well aware that this is a different economy than —than existed during the last\ntightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Jeanna Smialek. Let ’s go to Jeanna. [No\nresponse] Okay. Let ’s go to Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle. The\ntechnical question is, if , if you’ re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings\nand you won’ t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to\ntechnically mean that you won’ t or can ’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer. I s that\ncorre ct? That ’s the first thing.\nSecond of all, you suggested that , that the—with balance sheet running in the\nbackground —that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the\n\nsame time. That’s sort of the technical question part of it. The principal question I have is , you\nsaid it ’s going to be running in the background. But the statement on the balance sheet principles\nsays “ the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach ” based on “economic\nand financial developments, ” which suggests there ’s something of a reaction function associated\nto the balance sheet and it won’ t be running in the background. So can you give us any sense of\nthe discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction functi on surrounding the balance\nsheet? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me —let me —let me start by talking about that last paragraph.\nSo you’ ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the\nbalance sheet is a complicated o ne, and it involves , inevitably , surprises. And so during, during\nthe years , during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.\nNow, we didn’ t intend to do that. It just—events required us to do so. So we got a pretty robust\nparagraph there that says we’ re free to do this at any time. And it doesn ’t mean we’ re going to,\nbut if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we ’re not going to be —we ’re\nnot going to stick with something that isn’ t working. Th at’s all that ’s saying. It’ s meant to be\nquite a general statement rather than a , a hint.\nSo, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is , is\nembodied in these principles . So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is\nthe primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we ’ll use —determine the timing and\npace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to\nreduce the size after we begin th e process of raising rates, and on and on like that. I mean, that —\nthose are all the things that , that try to describe how we will proceed.\n\nBut maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question : You know, asset purchases\nwere , were enormously import ant at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market\nfunction, as they were at —right after the —in the critical phase of the G lobal F inancial C risis.\nAnd then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the\neconomy no longer needs this , this highly accommodative policy that we put in place. So it ’s\ntime to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance\nsheet. Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be. We’ ve identified the\nend state as —in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in\nthe ample -reserves regime. So there ’s a substantial amount of , of shrinkage in the balance sheet\nto be done. That’s going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable.\nAnd so those are some of the ways that I would think this , this lays out our , you know, the way\nwe—the way we ’re thinking about this.\nIn terms of the timing, I can ’t really help you. You know, it just says after , after we get\nunder way. So we ’re—I would say we are , we’re going to have another discussion at , at the next\nmeeting. And my guess is , we’ll have at least one other d iscussion at the meeting after that.\nAnd, you know, we ’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress. And we ’ll, you know, we ’ll start the\nprocess of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time. It ’s—I wish I coul d say more. But, honestly, we haven’ t made those decisions. And we\nactually haven ’t even really had the , the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will\nhave at coming meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Craig Torres.\nCRAIG TORRES. Chair Powell, Chair Powell. Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair\nPowell. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you\n\nsaid risks are two sided. And I ’m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the\nelusive soft landing. Is Fed policy a risk? Overtightening? Or what are the risks?\nAnd then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question. You know,\nRobert Kaplan’ s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair\nPowell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns. And we ’ll list transactions and all\nkinds of things. And next to those transactions , we’ll put dates. And Bloomberg asked for the\ndates of Mr. Kaplan ’s transactions. The Dall as Fed is not giving us the dates. And I don’ t see\nwhy this is a matter for the i nspector general or anybody else. I mean, why can ’t he give us the\ndates? Will you help us get the dates of those transactions? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you asked about t he risks first. So I —you know, the one risk is\nthat inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and , certainly ,\nin my view as well. There ’s a risk that , that the high inflation we ’re seeing will be prolonged,\nand there ’s a risk that it will move even higher. So we don’ t—we don’t think that ’s the base\ncase, but you asked what the risks are. And that ’s—we have to be in a position with our\nmonetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes. And that calls for us to be in position.\nWe, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we ’ve got to\nbe in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains\nhigher.\nAnd, of course, that is a risk to th e—to the —to the expansion. You know, we ’ve been\nsaying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over\nthe last [one] , which was a record long expansion. We saw labor force participation rise. We\nsaw wages persis tently higher for people at the lower end, and there , there really was no obvious\n\nimbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion. It could have gone on for years were it\nnot hit by the pandemic.\nSo we’d love to find a way to get back to that. Th at’s going to require price stability, and\nthat’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal.\nSo I mentioned two- sided risks. You know, a couple things. One, Omi —COVID is not\nover. And COVID can continue to evolve, and it ’s just —we have to accept that it ’s not over,\nand the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be —that ’s sort of a downside risk\nfrom a growth standpo int. I would point to—you know, another , another risk is just further,\nfurther problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that ’s—their no- COVID policy may cause more\nlockdowns , is likely to, and that may play into— may play into more problems in supply chains.\nIn addition, there ’s what ’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there ’s plenty of\nrisk out there. And we, you know, we can’ t—we can’t forget that the re are risks on both sides.\nSo that ’s, that’s there. That ’s what I would say.\nI know you’ ve been all over this issue with , with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of , of\ninformation. We don’ t—we don’t have that information at the Board. And, you know, I hand—\nI asked the i nspector g eneral to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands. I play no role in\nit. I seek to play no role in it. And I don’ t—I really —I can ’t help you here today on this i ssue.\nAnd I ’m sorry I can ’t.\nCRAIG TORRES. Okay, okay.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Jeanna now.\n\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. And sorry for my\ntech issues. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands\ntoday. You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your\ncolleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year. And I wo nder if you still think that projection from December is a\nreasonable one. And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’ re thinking about\nthat. And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleratio n. Like, how do—how do we get from here, 7 percent CPI, to where you expect to be\nat the end of the year ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’d say, you know, since , since the December meeting, I would\nsay that the inflation situation is about the same but probably sligh tly worse. I ’d be inclined to\nraise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation —let ’s just go with that —by a few tenths\ntoday. B ut we ’re not writing , writing down an SEP at this meeting. B ut I think it ’s—it hasn ’t\ngotten better. It’ s probably gotten just a —just a bit worse, and that ’s been the pattern. That ’s\nbeen the pattern.\nSo I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there ’s a range there. And\nthat range has been moving to the right for , for a year now. And, by the way, if you look at other\nforecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living , you’ ve seen the same\npattern. So , what do we think about that? Well, I think we , you know, we wrote down rate\nincreases in the December meetings, each of us ind ividually. And I think to the extent the\nsituation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that ’s how\nwe’re thinking a bout it.\n\nI—as I mentioned, though, I think it ’s—part of this will be that us, the Fed , moving away\nfrom a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then,\nover time, to a policy that ’s not accommodative , in time. I don ’t know when that will be.\nThat’s—those are the things that we’ re—that we’re thinki ng about. That ’s, that’s part of it.\nAnother part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years. That impulse will be less, in fact, will be —will be negative this year. And so that ’s another\nthing. The other one is , we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And, you know, the\nports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now, what\nwe’re learning is, it ’s just taking much longer , so I think— longer than expected. And that , I\nthink, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think we ’ll come\noff of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the —in the spring last year. But,\nreally, what ’s—the question is going to be , what i s inflation running at? And so we ’ll be\nwatching that.\nAnd I , you know, we —our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent . It’s also\nto provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very, very\nstrong right now, and I think that that strength will continue. There ’s a—there ’s really a shortage\nof workers. We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in\nthe lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other indicators. So I think that ’s, that’s what we ’re looking at. And we ’re also —you know, we\nrealize, I think, as everyone does , that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we ’re going to have\nto adapt. And we ’re going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we ’re going to have to be\nadaptable and , you know, move , move as appropriate.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Great. Thank you.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Colby Smith.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, when you talk about being\nhumble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the\npossibility of raising interest rates by large r increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at\nsome point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently? And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions. We really\nhaven’ t. And , and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a\ndifferent situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’ 16, ’17, ’18 when we were\nraising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent , even below 2 percent . Unemployment was ,\nwas not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent\nrange.\nRight now , we have inflation running substantially above 2 perc ent and, and, you know,\nmore persistently than we would like. We have growth —even in forecasts, even in the\nsomewhat reduced forecast for 2022 —we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than\nwhat we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where, by so many\nmeasures, it is historically tight. I think the —you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is , is\nlooking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the\nunemployment rate cons istent with] maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and\njob openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’ re seeing —and, and just the ratio of job\nopenings to unemployed —you’ re seeing a very, very tight labor market.\nNow, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It ’s\n1½ percentage point s lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a [full] percentage point of\n\nthat is , is retirements. Some part of those retirements are, are, you know, rela ted to COVID\nrather than just regular retirements . So we think there ’s, there ’s a pool of people out there who\ncould come back into the labor force. But it’ s not happening very quickly, and it may not —it\nmay continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going] . So that ’s, that ’s,\nthat’s how we think about that. We haven ’t made —to your specific question—we really have\nnot addressed those questions. And we ’ll begin to address them as we— as we move into the\nMarch meeting and meetings after that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how\ninflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower -, lower -income earners? And\nare you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can ’t effectively measure , the impact of inflation\non some of the most vulnerable households? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s, it’s more a matter of —I think the problem that we ’re—that\nwe’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck\nto paycheck, they’ re spending most or all of their —of, of what they ’re earning on food, gasoline,\nrent, heating their —heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right\naway forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that ’s really the point. I\ndon’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different\nsocioeconomic groups. It’s—that’s not the point. The point is , some people are just really in\na—prone to suffer more.\nI mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’ t good. It’ s bad. High\ninflation is , is bad, but they’ re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive\n\ntheir cars and things like that. It’s more —so that , that ’s really how I think of it. And, you know,\nwe, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans. But part of —part of it is just\nthat it’ s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of\ntheir—of their income on necessities, which are —which are experiencing high inflation now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Michelle , and t hank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking\nthe question here. So year over year, inflation ’s at a 40 -year high. Th e [increase in] input costs\nfor producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record. Some investors fear that the\nFed might be moving too late. Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes,\nbut was a rate hike more than 25 ba sis points discussed today?\nAnd as a follow to that —because I have problems with the mute button —as a follow to\nthat, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year. You\ntalked about that today. The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip\nshortage will last into 2023. So today you said inflation will start to ease this year. I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to\nbe completely worked out by the end of this year. I do not expect the m, and I have not expected\nthem. What I would say , and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the\nsecond half of this year, mainly —progress because we’ re not making much progress. If you\nlook at a ton of metrics, you can find some th at suggest that delivery times are shorter and\ninventories in some industries moving up. But, overall, we ’re not —we ’re not making progress.\nAnd, you know, things like the semiconductor issue a re going to —they ’re going to be quite a\nlong time. I would th ink they’ ll go more than through 2023.\n\nIn terms of —so in terms of being too late, I would just say this. We—our policy needs to\nbe positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the\npossibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we ’d expected. And\nwe think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we ’re\ncommitted to doing that. And that ’s, that’s really where we are.\nIn terms of your , your question about the , the size of rate increases, we haven ’t—we\nhaven’t faced those decisions. We haven ’t made them. It isn ’t possible to sit down here today\nand tell you with any confidence what the —what the precise path will be. But in —as we work\nour way through this , meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different\nexpansion, as I ’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger\neconomy. And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in —in the policy that we\nimplement.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Mike McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ’d like to sort of weave some of the\nstrands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is. Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent ? Do you want to go\nbelow 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate? And because you said we\nhave to protect the employment part of your mandate, i s there some sort of circuit breaker that\nwould stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, no. There ’s no—there ’s nothing in our framework about having\ninflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the\nanswer to that is , is “no.” What we’ re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations\nwell anchored at 2 percent . That ’s, that’s always the , the ultimate goal. And we do that in the\n\nservice of having inflation —we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent over time.\nAnd if inflation doesn’ t average 2 percent over time, then it ’s not clear why inflation\nexpectations would be anchored at 2 percent . So that , that’s the way we think about tha t. You\nknow, it —what was the last part of your —of your question?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I was asking if you’ re protecting the employment side of the\nmandate, whether there ’s some sort of circuit breaker there.\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing like that. I mean, I would s ay you have a tremendously\nstrong labor market. And you have growth this year at —forecast to be well above —well above\npotential. I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2\n[percent]. Most forecasts [of actual growth] ar e significantly above that for 2022, and that ’s\neven with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market’ s going\nto be strong for some time.\nWe’re —ideally , what we ’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent .\nAnd we ’re trying to do that in a process that , that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also\nleave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take.\nAgain, I would say that it isn ’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down. It’ ll be\nsupply- side improvements, and it ’ll be less, les s fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all\nlikelihood.\nSo—but monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent .\nAnd a situa tion where , where the two goals are —the two goals can be in tension is a difficult\none. But I —but I don’ t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant\nthreat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher pa rticipation over time is\nhigh inflation. And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these large r wage\n\nincreases that we’ re seeing now. So we do hope to achieve , and our plan is to achieve , both of\nthose goals.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I co uld— if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too\nmuch as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being\nmore forecast dependent in making decisions , rather than the state dependency you’ ve been\nusing as a framework for the last year and a half or so?\nCHAIR POWELL. State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we —if\nwe saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflatio n—actual inflation before\nwe tightened. And so that was a very state -dependent thought because, for a long time, we ’d\nbeen tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared. And that was the case for , for a number of years. So in thi s particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring\nincoming data as well as the evolving outlook.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask you, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, and I real ize, I mean, that is what it is. But do you feel that, you know,\nmonetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we ’re having right now is because the government response, you know,\ncollectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it ’s too soon to write that history, really. But what I would\nsay is this. The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the\nglobal economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to\ntheir homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines , and it could be a really long\n\ntime to get them, you know . And then, you know, you have —economic activity drops by a\nshocking amount in one —so there was a real risk of lasting damage.\nAnd I think Congress responded remarkably with the —with the CARES Act, incredibly\ntimely and very powerful. People will —there ’ll always be flaws in these things. B ut in real\ntime, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded. And what we were able to do was,\nyou know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what\nreally needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress\nenabled with the CARES Act.\nSo now, that was a lot of —that was a lot . And what we did was a lot. And, you know,\nnow—so , what we have now is , we have the strongest recovery of any, any country. And we\nhave —we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we ’ve had, because\nwe’ve, we ’ve put so much support behind the recovery. And we ’re managing the , the relatively\nhigh- class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage. So —and\nthese are serious problems, very serious problems that we , you know, we ’re working as hard as\nwe can on.\nWas it too much? Again, I ’m going to leave that to the historians . And—but look, i n\n25 years, we ’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2- , 3-, 4-, 5-year period.\nAnd we ’ll say, you know, we ’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment\nabout the actions that people took. But it was all founded, though, in a —in a very strong\nreaction to a , you know, to a unique historical event. And I guess I ’ll have to leave it at that. I\nlook for —I hope I ’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Fair enough. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Jean Yung.\n\nJEAN YUNG. Thanks, Michelle. Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield\ncurve could flatten , or even invert , after rate hikes begin. Would that worry you, and how\nimportant is that risk in the Fed’s considera tion for adjusting policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’ t\ncontrol the slope of the yield curve. Many flat —many factors influence longer -term interest\nrates. But it is something that we watch, and , and you w ill know that from when we had this\nissue a few years ago. And we take it into account , along with many other financial conditions ,\nas we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that ’s,\nthat’s one thing I would say.\nAnother is, currently, you’ ve got a slope. If you think about 2s to 10s, 2- year Treasury to\n10-year Treasury, I think that ’s around 75 basis points. That ’s well within the range of a\nnormal —of a normal yield -curve slope. So it ’s something we ’re monitoring. We don ’t think of\nit as—I don’ t think of it as some kind of an iron law. But we do look at it and try to understand\nthe implications and what it ’s telling us. And it ’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.\nJEAN YUNG. Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it —if it did invert, would you tie it\nto U.S. fundamentals? Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ d—that ’s, that’s a good question in, in real time. Obviously,\nU.S. long- term sovereign debt is an —is an important global asset. And it —and the fact that our\nrates are so much higher than , than other risk -free sovereign rates around the world may put\nsomething of a ceiling on our —on our rates. I don ’t know. But it would really depend on the —\non the facts and circumstances at that time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.\n\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Within the\ncontext of just the broad effort to normalize rates, wo uld you describe what you want to do as a\ngradual hiking? And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it ’s often the talking\npoint for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’ t emerge. Is that\nsomething that has a lso factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?\nThanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would describe what we ’re doing along these lines. This is going to\nbe a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy\nthat we put in place to deal with the —with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that ’s\ngoing to involve a number of things. It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset\npurchases. It’s going to involve lifting off. And it ’s going to involve additional rate increases as\nappropriate. And we , we have —we ’re going to write down in March our next assessment of\nwhat that might be. It ’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite\nadaptable, I think, in our under standing of this.\nThe last thing we ’re going to do is , we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think,\nto talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner. And that ’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I\nwouldn’ t—I don’ t think it’ s possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we ’re, we’re\ngoing to need to be, as I ’ve mentioned, nimble about this.\nAnd the economy is quite different this time. I’ve said this several times now. The\neconomy is quite different . It’s stronge r. Inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much\nstronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make —as we make monetary policy. And\n\nyou asked about financial stability concerns . In connection with our policy–w as that your\nquestion?\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Yes. Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set\nof] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that . I didn ’t\nknow if that was part of the discussion today.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would just say this. We, we, of course, have a financial stability\nframework. And what it shows is a number of , of positive aspects of financial stability. But you\nmentioned, really , [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat\nelevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don’ t really think asset\nprice s themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that ’s because\nhouseholds are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape\nfinancially. Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing. The banks are highly\ncapitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong. There are some concerns in the— in\nthe nonbank financial sector around —still around money market funds, although the SEC is\nmaking—has made some very positive proposals there . And we also saw some things in the\nTreasury market during the acute phase of the crisis , which , which we ’re looking at ways to\naddress. But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable —are manageable, I\nwould say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. T hank you very much."
