  "text": "December 16 , 2020\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and\nprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide\nrelief and stability, to ensure that the rec overy will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting\ndamage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases. Together, thes e measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful\nsupport to the economy until the recovery is complete.\nEconomic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second -quarter level. The\nsubstantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an\nannual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated. H ousehold spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been\nstrong and ha s moved above its pre -pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains\nlow, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and\nhospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federa l stimulus\npayments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. B usiness investment has also picked up. The recovery\nhas progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections. Even so, overall economic acti vity remains well below its level before the\npandemic , and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.\n\nIn the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and\nApril have been regained , as many people were able to return to work. As with overall economic\nactivity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. Job growth slowed to\n245,000 in November, and while t he unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remain s\nelevated at 6.7 percent. Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic\nlevels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will not\nlose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the un employment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is\n5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023. The economic downturn\nhas not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage\nworkers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic\ndislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in\nthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly\nsoft. Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.\nThe median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.\nAs we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is\nextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the course of the virus. Recent news\non vaccines has been very positive. However, sign ificant challenges and uncertainties remain\nwith regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy across\n\ndifferent groups. It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implications\nof these de velopments . The ongoing surge in new COVID -19 cases, both here in the United\nStates and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be very challenging. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to enga ge—reengage in a broad range of activities.\nAs we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEP\nmaterials at the same time as our FOMC statement. Included in these materials are two new exhibits that show how the balance of par ticipants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have\nevolved over time . Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge the\nlevel of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated. In terms of risks to the outlook,\nfewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September.\nWhile a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic\nactivity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.\nThe Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad- based and inclusive\ngoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent. As we reiterated in today’s\nstatement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and\n\nlonger -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an\naccommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\nachieved . With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain\nthe current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderate ly exceed 2 percent for some time.\nIn addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our\nholdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed\nsecurities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made\ntoward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals . We believe the increase in our\nbalance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the e conomy.\nCombined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance\nsheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reaching\nour employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher ex pected path of the balance sheet. Overall,\nour interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.\nThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly\nsupport th e flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for\nstate and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to\n\nthe economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency\nlending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in\nvery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,\nenabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Altho ugh funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or new\npurchases after—of assets after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerging\nlending facilities, if needed, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund. When the time comes,\nafter the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box.\nAs I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed\ncannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with\nbroad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will\nbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,\nbusinesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe of our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity\nand employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\n\nTo conclude, w e understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to\nusing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rich Miller.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Michelle. I wonder\nif I could start with the , the SEP. We have —unemployment now is at 6.7 , the SEP median sees,\nsees it falling to 5. Headline inflation is one time 1.2, t he SEP median sees it rising to 1.8 . And\ncore inflation is 1.4 , and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise. Would that constitute “ substantial\nfurther progress ” toward the C ommittee ’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. Well, so we ’re not —we’re not going to be identifying\nspecific—associating that test with , with specific numbers at this point. So, really, the question\nis, what do we mean by, by that language ? And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that\nour guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum -employment and price -stability goals are achieved , and\nthat’s, that’s a powerful message. So “ substantial further progress ” means what it says. It means\nwe’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level\nand inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal before we start making\nadjustments to our purchases.\nI would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding\npolicy accommodation. There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation. And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off. So I can ’t give you an exact set of numbers. We will—of\n\ncourse, as we approach that point, we ’ll be evaluating that. And when we see ourselves on a\npath to achieve that goal, then we will —we will say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time\nwhen we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases.\nRICH MILLER. Very quickly on, on that. You, you mentioned the next couple months\nare going to be very chal lenging. And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration\nof the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, again, I would start with what w e actually did at the\nmeeting, w hich, which was, we provided this , this guidance about the path of asset purchases.\nAnd I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward. And,\nyou know, so I guess since September we ’ve now adopted a flexible average inflati on-targeting\nframework. We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in\nthat new framework. And now we ’ve done the same for , for asset purchases. So, you know,\nwe’ve, we’ve been sort of —as, as the future has become clearer and as we ’ve absorbed new\ndevelopments in medical —in the medical sphere and also in , in the economy, we have —began to\nbe able to see further. So we ’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance.\nAnd we think that the —that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important. We think\nthat the , the prior language of “in coming months ” was obviously temporary. This links that\nguidance, those purchases , to actual “substantial further progress ” toward our , our mandated\ngoals. We think that ’s important. And we think that that is important to have done.\nI, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is\nappropriate. We think it ’s providing a great deal of support for the economy. Fi nancial\nconditions are highly accommodative. And, you know, we monitor a range of financial\ncondition indexes. There are many of them, and they’ ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that.\n\nYou can—you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy —for example,\nhousing, durable sales, vehicle sales —those parts of the economy are, are performing very, very\nwell. The parts of the economy that are weak are the service -sector businesses that involve close\ncontact. Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the\nvirus.\nAnd I ’ll close by , by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more\naccommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels. And we recognize that circumstances co uld shift in a way that warrants our , our doing that, including by\nadjusting purchases. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S.\neconomy to achieve our goals. We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done. No one should doubt that.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timiraos.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timirao s, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, a\ntwo-part question. What , if anything, would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases toward\nthe longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs? And does your guidance today on asset purchases foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point , lengthen\nmaturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchas e amounts ?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I , I don’t —I\nwouldn’ t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations. You know, we , we look at our\noverall stance of policy, w e look at overall financial conditions , we look at what ’s going on in\nthe economy—different parts of the economy, and w e ask ourselves, should we change our\npolicy stance? We do that at every meeting . And we look at where financial conditions are now ,\n\nand, and we , we feel that they are appropriate for now. Anytime we feel like the economy could ,\ncould use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it. We—but r ight now,\nwe’re providing a great deal, a nd we think—we happen to think it ’s the right amount.\nAnd, you know, you, you mentioned —I think you’ re referring to the idea of maintaining\nthe duration but , but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did. And\nthat, that is something that we —you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was\naddressed in the minutes. And I would say, the views on that were mixed : Some thought it was\nan interesting idea, others not so much. I , I wouldn’ t say that that ’s something that ’s, that’s high\non our list of , of possibilities.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Polit ico. I want ed to ask about the\n13(3) facilities. Chair Powell, you’ ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin ’s\ninterpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on , on what should happen with those programs.\nSo, first of all, I ’m curious whether under a new Treasury S ecretary you will accept whatever\nlegal interpretation they put forward for those programs. And then, also, given that there isn ’t a\nstatutory requirement for you to have financi al backing from Treasury for 13( 3) facilities, do you\nhave any plans for any future facilities that don ’t requir e Treasury backing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on your —on your first question, we really have not thought about\nthat. We ’re, we’re very focused on—we have a lot to do now. We, we have not focused on, on\nthat question , and I , I really have nothing to add on that. Your second question is —sorry. Oh, if\nthere were no —ye s. No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability to\ndo facilities under 13( 3) in some cases with no backing. But we can ’t do any 13( 3) faciliti es\n\nwithout the approval of the Treasury S ecretary , right? But we did some facilities —I think one of\nour facilities this time didn ’t have any Treasury backing. And I think some in the —in the round\nof—during the G lobal F inancial C risis also didn ’t have any.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any plans —like, would you consider doing more\nfacilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing?\nCHAIR POWELL. I would say that we are—you know, we ’re—we have the authorities\nwe have. We will use them if , if they’ re needed and if —and if the law permits us to do so. We\nwould—we would always do that. We, we do not have any plans for , for the future about this.\nWe—we ’re very focused on, on getting through year -end. We’ve been very focused on, on the\nissues that are right in front of us. A nd, honestly, we ’re not —we’re not planning on anything or\nhaving any discussions about what we might do down the road.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year. I know how much\nyou enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus , so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus. There ’s\ntalk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress. Is , is that sufficient? Is\nthat what you’ re looking for? Do you think that ’ll be sufficient for helping the economy?\nFinally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is. I wonder if you can put\nsome detail on that. How much concern do you have in terms of , where could employment go?\nWhat could happe n to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this surge ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay . So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.\nThe case for fiscal policy right now is , is very, very strong. And I think that is widely\nunderstood, I would say, now. The details of it are entirely up to Congress. But with the\n\nexpiration of unemployment benefits —some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of\neviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is , there ’s a need for households and\nbusinesses to have , have fiscal support. And I do think that —again , I think that is widely\nunderstood. So I think it would be —I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is\ndoing right now. It’s not up to us to judge that work. It ’s really, really theirs. And I , I don’ t\nhave a view for you on, on the size of it. It ’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill.\nOn the surge, you know, so it ’s a really interesting question. We have , and others too,\nhave consistently expected there to be more economic—that , that cases would hold— growth in\ncases would hold back the economy more than it actually has. So we ’ve overestimated the, the\neffects on the economy of , of these spikes we’ ve been having.\nNow, this spike is so much larger that I thin k—and I think forecasters generally do think\nthat there —that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves\npeople getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that. And\nyou’re starting to see that. In the —in the high -frequency data, you’ re now beginning to see that\nshow up. And I think if this is —the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the\ncountry that that, that seems like it must happen.\nNow, how big will it be? We don’ t—we don’t really know. You know, there are —there\nare a lot of estimates. The general expectation is , you’ re seeing some slowing now. And you’ ll\nsee the first quarter could well be— what , what we said is that coming months are going to be\nchallenging. The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this.\nAt the same time, people are getting vaccinated now. They ’re getting vaccinated. And\nby the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’ re going to be seeing significant\nnumbers of people vaccinated. And so then what will be —how will that play into economic\n\nactivity? Again, we don’ t have any experience with this. You have to think that sometime in the\nmiddle of next year, you will —you will see people feelin g comfortable going out and engaging\nin a broader range of activities. And some people will be probably quick to do that. Some are\ndoing it now without a vaccine —right ?—in many parts of the country.\nSo, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the\nsecond half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly. We should be —\nyou know, we should be getting people back to work. Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing. The issue is more the next four or five months —getting through the next four,\nfive, six months. That is key. And , and, you know, clearly there ’s going to be need for help\nthere. And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we ’ll be getting that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeann a Sm ialek.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I was\nwondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices. They were mentioned in the most\nrecent minutes as, you know, potential ly a valua tion concern, especially as it related to your\nmortgage -backed security purchases. And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market\nlooks more or less fully healed. And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation\npressures there? And , if so, what can the Fed do to contain those?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the\neconomy, and housing prices are something that we ’ve been monitoring. And you see them\nmoving up. You see very high demand. T his, this is the housing market that people have been\nexpecting since , you know, 2010. And , and then, you know , not many, when the —when the\npandemic hit , thought, “Oh, this is what —this is what will produce that housing market ,” but\nit has.\n\nNow, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not —are not\nof a level of concern right now . That’s just reflective of a lot of demand. And, you know,\nbuilders are going to bring forth supply. There ’s also a sense that this—some of this may be\npent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once\nthat demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable.\nSo it’s a— it’s a healthy economy now. We, we met recently with a bunch of\nhomebui lders , and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they ’ve never seen the likes of\nit. But , no, housing prices themselves are not —are not a financial stability concern at the\nmoment. We will watch that carefully. But in the near term, I wouldn ’t think that that ’s an issue\nthat we ’d be concerned about.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. So with the\nactions that you’ve currently taken, how do you—how do you further fight a slowdown that\nyou’re seeing? We ’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month,\nthe unemployment, the job growth has slowed down. Is there more the Fed can do to fight this?\nOr is it now squarely in the Congress ’s realm?\nCHAIR POWELL. T here is more that we can do, cer tainly. We can —we can expand\nour, our asset purchase programs . We can focus them more on the longer end. There are a\nnumber of options we would have to provide more support to the econom y.\nSo I would—I would say , though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’ t\njust from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable\nlags. It’s really support. As the—as—we’ve, w e’ve talked about this as all of these government\n\npolicies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was\ncreated by the pandemic. And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they ’re\nacross it.\nBut there ’s a group for , for which they, they don’ t have a bridge yet. And that ’s who\nwe’re talking about here. It’ s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs. It’ s people who may\nlose their homes. It’s —you know, you see the, the —many, many millions of America ns are, are\nwaiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country. So we know there ’s need out\nthere. We know there are small businesses all over the country that , that have been basically\nunable to really function , and they’ re just hanging on. So —and, and they ’re, they’re so critical\nto our economy. So —and , by the way, now that we can—we can kind of see the light at the end\nof the tunnel, it would be —it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their\nlife’s work in many cases, or even generations ’ worth of work, because they couldn ’t last another\nfew months, which is what it amounts to.\nSo we have more we can do. And we’ll —I, I think more the issue is , we’re going to need\nto continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the , the\neconomy will be growing in expectation. We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year. But it’ s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of ,\nof labor market —the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and\nfor much of the last couple of years. So that ’s how I think about it.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider.\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chai r Powell. Thanks for doing this. And thanks,\nMichelle. Two , two quick questions. One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed modeled,\nsort of a working estimate of when the U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity?\nAnd, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the\ndecision to maintain th e current pace and quantities of bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs\nare showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent . Some might argue that you need\nto do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say “ We’re going to miss\nour target for another three years ” doesn ’t show a very firm commitment to the new framework.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , in terms of the vaccine, ye s, you know, we do estimates of , of\nwhen the United States would reach herd immunity, and they’ re, they’re going to be similar to\nwhat other people think. You know, i t depends on your assumptions, such as how many people\nwill actually take the vaccine a nd how fast will the rollout be . So it’ s assumption based on\nassumption based on assumption. But , you know, sometime —it’ s possible sometime in the\nmiddle or second half of next year. I ’m not going to try to be precise , because it ’s just another\nestimate. You know, our people are very good, but they ’re looking at , at the same data as other\npeople are. And so, you know, all the estimates are —it depends on what your assumptions are.\nBut under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as , as soon as the middle of next year .\nIn terms of the , you know, inflation, a couple things —your second question. You know,\nwe’re —I think you have to be honest with yourself about , about inflation these days. There\nare—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there ha ve been for a\nwhile , and they persist today. It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up. And it isn ’t\ngoing to be just a question—it’ s going to take some time. It took a l ong time to get inflation\nback to 2 percent in the last crisis.\n\nAnd, you know, we ’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even\nwith the very high level of accommodation that we ’re providing both through low rates and very\nhigh levels o f asset purchases, it will take some time, because that ’s what we believe the\nunderlying inflation dynamics are in our economy. And that ’s sort of why we ’re—one reason\nwhy we ’re concerned about inflation is that we see that. And , and that ’s why we have a dopted\nthe flexible average inflation -targeting framework. That ’s why we ’re aiming for an overshoot.\nBut we ’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to\nget there.\nIn terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to , to move asset\npurchases, y ou know, I don’ t think that would really be —I think it ’s going to take a long time\nhowever you do it. And, you know, we ’ve been having very long expansions since— in, in the\nlast several decades because inflation has not —really , the old model was , inflation would come\nalong and the Fed would tighten, and we ’d have a recession.\nNow inflation has been low, and we haven’ t had that dynamic. And the result has been\nthree of t he four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history. So, you know,\nwe’re, we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion, a nd that we ’ll keep our —what\nwe’re saying is, we ’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the e xpansion is well\ndown the tracks. And we ’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually\nreaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent . That ’s a very strong commitment ,\nand we think that ’s the right place to be.\nHOWAR D SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rug aber. I’m sorry, Mr. Chair.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly\ncredible. If you look at what —at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of , of when\nthe Fed will lift off , everything has moved. There have been significant movements since we\nannounced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the —with the framework being\ncredible to market participants. So I , I don’ t think it’ s something that —I, I mean, I ’m actually\npleased by , by the reception it’ s gotten in markets. And markets have moved in ways that\nsuggest it is credible.\nMICHELLE SMITH. T hank you. Chris .\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi, thank you. Yesterday, I guess, the Fed said that it is\njoining the international financial g reening group. And I just wanted to see if you could expand\non how the Fed is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed policy going\nforward. Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate\nchange when it comes to financial regulation. But how do you see that also potentially affecting\nmonetary policy? Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed for buying bonds of oil and\ngas companies. But leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there— is there any way that\nclimate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the —you’ re, you’re talking about the —sorry, the Network [of\nCentral Banks and Supervisors ] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week.\nAnd I ’ll just —I’ll just say a couple things about that. So , first, I ’ll just start by saying that we ’re\ngoing to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change\naffects our work, including the areas you mentioned. We’re going to do so with a great deal of\nengagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected\nrepresentatives who are charged with our oversight. We ’ll do it with great transparency.\n\nRemember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those\ngoals are set by Congress. We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we’ ll use\nvigorously. We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out,\ndebated , and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our\nstatutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities. And because we have a narrow\nremit, a nd because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from\ndirect political control. So society’ s broad response to climate change is for others to decide— in\nparticular, elected leaders.\nBut—so let me —let me get to your question. What does all that mean for an issue like\nclimate change? And why did we join the NGFS? So Congress hasn’ t explicitly assigned us or\nother financial regulators a role , and we ’re not among the agencies who contribute to the\nNational Climate Assessment —Climate Assessment , for example. But climate change is\nnonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law. And let me tell you why.\nOne of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the\nfinancial system. That ’s a responsibility we share with other agencies. The public will expect\nthat we will —we will do that. So we ’ll, we’ll expect that , that those important institutions will\nbe resilient against the many resists —risks that they fake—face: credit risk, market risk, cyber\nrisk. Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system , and the\neconomy. And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that\nmeans, what needs to be done about it, and by whom. That ’s why 83 central banks have joined\ntogether to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area. We’ve\nbeen attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the w ork. We\nhad discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.\n\nI’ll just say that the financial system is really a global one. It ’s important that we work\nand discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world , especially in a field where w e’re\njust beginning to develop our , our understanding.\nYou asked about monetary policy. You know, I —I’ll say this. We, we have historically\nshied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation. In fact, our agreement with Treasury\nduring the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’ 10 says that we will avoid credit allocation. It’s\nsomething we ’ve carefully avoided. So I , I would be very reluctant to see us move in that\ndirection, picking one are a as creditworthy and another not.\nSo you asked about monetary policy. Y ou know, it’s , it’s—for now , I would say the\nreal—the real concern is —the real place to focus, for me , is supervision of financial institutions\nand then financial stability concerns. You can see a connection there. Monetary policy,\nmaximum employment, stable prices —it’ s less obvious to me. I can —I can, you know —I can\nmake the argument, but it ’s less obvious to me that those should be first -order things that we\nwould look at in conne ction with climate change. But I think there ’s—I think there’s work to be\ndone to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of\nfinancial markets and financial institutions. I think that work is in its early days. A nd, again,\nwe’ll be careful . We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. And\nthank you, Michelle. I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid. J ust as one example,\nthe governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget d eficit , and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that ’s being debated this week\n\nseems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point. And I ’m just curious if you can give\nsome detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid s pecifically to state and\nlocal governments will have on the recovery and, specifically , with the m unicipal l ending f acility\nset to expire, what more the Fed might be able to do to fill that specific hole. Thanks very much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So the sta te and local governments, they provide important\ncritical services: safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that. They ’re, they’re really\ninvolved in people ’s lives, state and local governments are, to , to a large extent. The decision\nwhether to , to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress. And , you\nknow, they’ re in th e middle of these discussions, a nd, and those , those are issues for them to\ndecide.\nI would say that the picture is mixed. What ’s happened is, if you’ re a state that has a\nsignificant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground— oil from the ground, or\ngas—you are probably, at least in those industries , feeling a significant loss of revenue. A\nnumber of other states have been surprised on the upside, where —and that ’s because goods\nsales, for example—property taxes are—don’ t move much year to year. And, you know, the\nkind of sales taxes on goods —goods sales have been very high. Income has been more or less\nreplaced by, by the CARES Act —fully replaced , more than, in many cases. So the concerns that\nwe had at the very beginning of really serious , deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the\npart of state and local governments have not yet —have not yet occurred. What w e’re seeing is,\nis that it’ s different state to state. And some states are having significant difficulties, others not\nso much.\nThe real concern , though , that still emerges is , state and local governments are very large\nemployers, and—one of the largest. And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has\n\ndropped by 1.3 million in—of state and local government. So it ’s, it’s a very large number of\npeople to be —to be out of work from just that one source. It’s actually significantly more than\nlost their job s during the Global F inancial C risis.\nSo that is —that is a significant —a significant part of that group is , is in education. So\nwhen the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.\nNonetheless, it ’s a concern. We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that —why that\nmany people have been let go and what are —really are the sources. So we ’re monitoring it\ncarefully, and it ’s a mixed picture. And I , I just have to leave the question of what to do with\nfiscal policy on this to Congress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi.\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. You and the Fed\nhave consistently said that the Fed is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support\nif needed a nd really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough\noutweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there ’s so much suffering in the\neconomy. The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of time but is\nnot a big new easing step. Why was now , with the short -term outlook deteriorating due to the\nnew coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step? And is it because of the medium- term outlook improving? Or is it because the Fed just doesn’ t have the capacity to sort\nof build that bridge over the next four to five months for the —for the people who are struggling?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right . So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is ,\nthis is —this is a very, very lar ge asset purchase program. It’ s providing a tremendous amount\nof, of support for the economy. If you look at the interest- sensitive parts of the economy, they’ re\nperforming very well. The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high\n\ninterest rates. They ’re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, i n a sense . These are —these are\nthe businesses that , that are really hit hard by people ’s reluctance to gather closely .\nSo, so we , we do have the ability to —you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer -term\nbonds. And , and we may —we may use it. I’m not saying we won’ t—we won’t use that . It may\nwell come to , to using that. But also, I would remind —I would also note , though, monetary\npolicy works with “ long and variable lags, ” is the famous statement. So we think that the big\neffects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future. So this looks\nlike a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy. And , and\nthat’s why it is , is a very positive thing that, that we’re getting that.\nSo we , we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset\npurchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities , because that had —that also increases accommodation by taking more duration\nrisk out of the market. But we think our current stance is appropriate. And we think that our —\nyou know, that our , our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the\neconomy over time. Again, what we ’ve—what we’ve done is , we’ve laid out a path whereby\nwe’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until —really\nuntil we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know , not really the way it ’s been done\nin the past. So that ’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now.\nWe don’ t think the economy suffers from a lack of , of highly accommodative financ ial\nconditions. We think it ’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in\ncertain kinds of economic activity. And we expect that , that with the virus, that that will\nimprove —that condition will improve. Nonetheless, again, we will—ar e prepared to use our\n\ntools , and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we—as we think would,\nwould help.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Scott Horsley, NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Some forecasters have suggested that\nthere is a lot of pent -up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that\nmight stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely\ndistributed, a nd that the beaten -down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in,\nin a hurry. How might that affect inflation , in your mind? And would that be just a transient\nproblem or , or something that might warrant closer scrutiny?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that , that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price\nlevel. So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let ’s say, you know , that\nairfare, airfares —I’m just imagining this, right ?—that they go up. But what inflation is, is a\nprocess whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year. And if —given the inflation\ndynamics that we ’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price -level\nincrease has not resulted in ongoing price -level increases.\nAnd that , that was—the problem back in the 1970s was , it was the combination of two\nthings. One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up. But the second problem was that that —that that increase was persistent, there was a level of\npersistence. So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they ’d go up 6 percent next year, because\npeople would internalize. I mean , really, really , that ’s what happens is , people internalize that\nthey can raise prices, and that it ’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate. So that was\nthe inflation —those are the inflation dynamics of that era.\n\nThose dynamics are not in place anymore. The re—the connection between low\nunemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was. It ’s still\nthere , but it ’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was. And the persistence of inflation,\nif you—if you get a —for example, oil prices go up, a nd that ’ll send a temporary shock through\nthe economy. The persistence of that into , into inflation over time is just not there. So they—\nwhat you describe may happen, a nd, of course , we would watch it very carefully. We , we\nunderstand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will\nbehave in certain cases. But I would—I would expect , though, going in that that would be a\none-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. So not the kind of thing that the Fed would , would be trigger -happy\nto, to—\nCHAIR POWELL. No.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. — respond to?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, no. Definitely not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. [Inaudible] —question. But w hat I wanted to ask was, you know,\ngiven the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market , long run, can operate smoothly\nwithout some sort of active Fed presence—you know, buying Treasury debt? You know, I ’m\nreferring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles. He had some questions about it . So I wanted to\nknow where you stood on that issue.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So —you we re breaking up a little. I think —I think I got the\nsense of it, though. Ye s, I, I don’ t think it’ s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a\n\npermanent Fed presence. And we certainly don’ t—you know, that ’s not something we ’re\nplanning on or intending. Right now we ’re buying assets because it ’s a— you know, it ’s a—it’s a\ntime when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset\npurchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet.\nYou know, there ’s lots of demand for , for U.S. Treasury paper all —from all over the\nworld. And I , I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and\nlook at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector. And there ’s, there’s quite a lot of work going on on that front . But I , I don’t presume at all that,\nthat this is something that needs to be —where the Fed needs to be in there at all. I , I would think\nthat this should be handled by the private sector and can be. Institutions need to be able to hold this paper . And there may be —there may be a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a\nlot of risk. That’s, that’s yet to be proven. There are a lot of things that are being looked at\nright now.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang .\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. So , you know, as\nyou know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium -sized\nbusinesses. And the Fed launched a few efforts this year to—through its 13( 3) prog rams to reach\nout to those companies. But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed’s actions can do to provide support to those companies? Or is\nthat solely Congress ’s domain?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the main thing that those companies need is a —is a robust\nrecovery—a strong, robust recovery. And so we , we contribute to that through highly\naccommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are\nsupporting economic activit y. Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you\nknow, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those\nvaccines. And Congress contributes , contributes to that by helping them make it through this\nvery difficult time. And , and I think my understanding is that there ’s support for small\nbusinesses in , in what ’s being discussed on Capitol Hill. I would certainly think that would be\nsomething well worth looking at.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul La Monica.\nPAUL LA MONICA. Hi, Chair Powell—hi, Chair Powell . I was wondering if you’ ve\nhad any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden A dministration, particularly\nJanet Yellen, who obviously you can share some similar experience in running the Fed . So just\ncurious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new A dministration\nmight differ than the past couple of years.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we ’ve had a —and I ’ve had sort of the typical\nmeetings with the transition team for Treasury. They ’ve met with quite a lot of people in our\nagency and other agencies. And , really, it’ s about learning what we do. And I , I really have only\nspoken to f ormer Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated a nd just to say that I look\nforward to working with her. You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know. So I did that. But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her. And I , I’m not going to do that until she ’s confirmed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Jeff C ox.\n\nJEFF COX . Yes. Chair, thank you for taking the question. You ’ve been asked this\nquestion before in various forms. I ’m going to try it a little bit differently now. The equity\nmarket and the bond market seem to be telling two different stories about where , where things\nare heading. We [ inaudible] on the stock market , bond yields remain very low. Does that\nconcern you at all? A re, are you getting any more concerned about asset valuations in, in light of\nthe highly accommodative Fed policies?\nCHAIR POWELL. You, you were breaking up, but I , I think I got that. I think I got it.\nSo, you know, financial stability—we , we look at a broad range of things. We actually have a\nframew ork so that we can, you know, be —evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and\nso that the public can evaluate whether we’ re doing a job—a good job at it. We —so what do we\nlook at? Asset prices is one thing that we look at. And , you know, we published a report a few\nweeks ago on that —maybe it was month or so ago. A nyway. And I think you’ ll find a mixed\nbag there. It depends —with equities, it depends on whether you’ re looking at P /Es or whether\nyou’re looking at the premium ove r risk -free—over the risk -free return.\nIf you look at P /Es, they ’re historically high, but , you know, in a world where the —\nwhere the risk-free rate is sustain —is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium,\nwhich is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’ d look at. And\nthat’s not at , at incredibly low levels, w hich would mean that they’ re not overpriced in that\nsense. Admittedly, P /Es are high, but that ’s—you know , that ’s, that’s maybe not as relevant in a\nworld where we think the 10- year Treasury is going to be lower than it ’s been historically, from\na—from a return perspective.\nYou know, we look at —we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions.\nWe spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years buil ding up their capital. So far, they’ ve been a\n\nsource of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well. We look at leverage in\nthe nonfinancial sector —that’s households and nonfinancial corporates. Nonfinancial corporate\nleverage is high. We ’ve been watching that. But , you know, rates are really low. So —and so\ncompanies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are—\nrates are quite low. Your interest payments are low. Defaults and downgrades have , have\ndeclined since earlier in the year. Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed. But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress\nreplaced a lot of lost income. You know, it ’s very important that , that the economy gets strong\nagain. I mean, the , the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy.\nThe last thing is , is really funding markets. W e found that there was a lot of unstable\nfunding for companies, partic ularly financial companies. And that ’s, that’s down to a —to a very\nlow level these days. So the broad financial stability picture is , is kind of mixed, I would say. I\nwould say, you know, asset prices are , are a little high in that metric and in my view . But ,\noverall, you have a mixed picture. You , you don’ t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.\nSo—and it’s —again, it ’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily. You\nknow, we ’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and , and have published our , our framework,\nand, you know, we ’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed. So we work\nvery hard at it .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. And for the last question we ’ll go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal\nsupport for the economy. This year ’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion. And Republicans have\nargued they don’ t want to spend more, because we can ’t afford it. So I ’m wondering if you can\n\nmake the case for how mu ch we can afford. At what point do deficits and the debt start to have\nan impact on the economy or on interest rates? And how would we know when we get there?\nCHAIR POWELL. So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’ re\nthe ones —their reward is they get to make those very difficult de cisions. And—you know, so\nwe’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress. But I , I would just say, as a\ngeneral —as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path. F or my way of\nthinking and many others ’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when\nunemployment is low and taxes are —you know, are , are pouring in, and there ’s, there’s room to\nget on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy ’s really doing well. You ’re still now in\nthe—in the , you know, some part of , of an economic crisis. And the fact that Congress is\ndebating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairly\nsubstantial is going to get done, we hope —that what ’s being discussed is, you know, is , is of\nsome size.\nIn terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s —the question is —we ’ve\nalways looked at debt to GDP, and we ’re very high by that measure. By some other measures,\nwe’re actually not that high. In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the\namount of , what does it cost? And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest\ncosts of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we ’re actually —you know , we’re actually on\na more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes. Again, these are —these are\nissues for Congress. But , you know, I ’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal —the case for , for\nfiscal is, is strong. And I ’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if , if\nwe did get something soon.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, the argument for continuing to spend is that low interest\nrates make it affordable. Do you worry you get in a situation where you would have\ncongressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure\nto keep rates low because the country can ’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean, that ’s—I think we ’re a ve ry, very long way from that.\nYou know, the , the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick to\nour knitting. We try very hard to do that. And I , I think that ’s, that’s what people call fiscal\ndominance. And I , I think we ’re just a very, very long way from that. I think, you know, if\nwe—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and\nstable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don ’t think that that is something that will—that\nI would worry about, certainly not in the near term.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Good afternoon."
