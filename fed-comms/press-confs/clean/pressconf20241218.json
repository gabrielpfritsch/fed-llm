My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour, our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal.\nWe’re committed to maintaining our economy ’s strength by supporting maximum\nemployment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. To that end, today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce\nour securities holdings. I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a —at a solid\npace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, act ivity in the housing sector has been\nweak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections , Committee participants\ngenerally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over the next few years.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier\nin the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but , at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low. Nominal\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nwage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a\nbroad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in\n2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next few years.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer -run goal. Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November , and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and\n2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September. Thereafter, the median\nprojection falls to our 2 percent object ive.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the r isks on\nboth sides of our mandate.\nAt today’ s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds\nrate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼- 4½ percent. We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral\nsetting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing\nfurther progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation. With today’ s action, we\nhave lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nnow significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further\nadjustments to our policy rate.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on\ninflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We ’re not on any preset course.\nIn our S ummary of E conomic P rojections , FOMC participants wrote down their\nindividual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and\n3.4 percent at the end of 2026. These median projections are somewhat higher than in\nSeptember, consistent with the firmer inflation projection. These projections, however, are not a\nCommittee plan or decision.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation\ndoes not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the\nrisks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nOn a technical note : We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility\nto align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate —its typical configuration.\nTechnical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy : maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your\nquestions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. Thank you for taking\nour questions. I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’ s appropriate\nto cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year. And what\nwould you expect, at this point, the timing might look like? Would a January cut potentially be\npossible , or does a pause next month seem more likely?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so let , let me start by saying why we —why we cut today and\nthen—and then move to 2025. So I would say today was a —was a closer call, but we decided it\nwas the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability . We see the risks as two -sided : moving too\nslowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we ’re trying to steer between those two\nrisks , and, on balance , we decided to go ahead with a further cut . And I, I’ll give you some\ndetails on why.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nDownside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is\nnow looser than pre -pandemic , and it ’s clearly still cooling further, s o far in, in a gradual and\norderly way. We don’ t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to\n2 percent . Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold\nunemployment constant , the job -finding rate is low and declining, and other measures —such as\nsurveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that —broadly show a , a much cooler labor\nmarket than th ere was, than we had in 2019. It’ s still quite gradually cooling. So we , we keep an\neye on that .\nInflation, we see that story as still broadly on track , and, and I ’ll tell you why. We, w e’ve\nmade a great deal of progress. Twelve -month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November\nis estimated at 2.8 percent , down from a high of 5.6 percent . Twelve —but 12- month inflation\nhas actually been moving sideways, as we are “ lapping” very low readings of late last year .\nHousing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we\nmight like , but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.\nAnd we, we ’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for\ngoods . So I ’ll just say, we, we —so remember that we couple this decision today with the “ extent\nand timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at\nwhich it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments .\nYou ask about 2025. I , I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year\nreally reflects both the higher inflation readings we ’ve had this year and the expectation that\ninflation will be higher . You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we\nsee as higher . Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut . I think\nthe actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nWe’re, w e’re going to react to data . That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks\nis likely to be appropriate.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry, just one , one quick follow -up: Why, I guess, would you\nmake those cuts? Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this\nway: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points . We’ re significantly closer to\nneutral . At 4 .3 percent and “ change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive . But as\nfor additional cuts, we ’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as\ncontinued strength in the labor market . And as long as the economy and the labor market are\nsolid, we can be cautious about —as we consider furt her cuts . And all of that is reflected —to\nyour question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next\nyear, compared to four in September.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters , and thanks for the\nopportunity to ask you a question. So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the\nlast transition to a Trump A dministration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in\npart in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year .\nSome of it was a data mark -to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal . What ’s\nthe split on this one? How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,\nand how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I ’d say —I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start —let\nme start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place , and we think policy’s in a\nreally good place . Let ’s remember that the economy ’s growing 2½ percent this year, that\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ninflation has come down by 50 percent to, to— from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent . Headline\ninflation is 2.5 percent on a 12- month basis . We’re actually in a really good starting place here .\nBut since , you know —so , so what ’s really driving the , the slower rate- cut path? First\nthing is growth is stronger, right? We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so\nfar, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next\nyear as well . Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ ll see that participants\nthink that the —that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. And s o that ’s, that’s more\nstrength, right?\nInflation is higher, as we talked about . Inflation ’s higher this year . It’s also higher in the\nforecast next year . I’d also point out that we ’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another\nreason to be cautious about , about further moves . And—but then getting to your —to your point,\nthere ’s also, there ’s uncertainty —uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out , is actually higher .\nIt’s also —it’s also , in the case of some people, some people —the way I ’d say it is this : Some\npeople did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting . Some\npeople said they didn’ t do so, and some people didn’t, didn ’t say whether they did or not . So we\nhave people making a bunch of different approaches to that . But some did identify policy\nuncertainty as one of the reasons for their , their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.\nAnd, you know, the point of that uncertainty is , it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the\npath is uncertain you go a little bit slower . It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking\ninto a dark room full of furniture . You just slow down. And so that may have affected some of\nthe people . But as, as I said, there ’s a range of —range of approaches on the Committee.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that : You mentioned the risk and\nuncertainty indexes toward the back of the document . The upside risk to inflation jumped quite\nsubstantially . The only thing, really , that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the\ndisinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside . The only\nreal thing that’ s happened is November 5th, in the meantime . Is it fair to say that that ’s what ’s\ndriving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Actually, that ’s not the only thing that ’s happened. What ’s happened\nis that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think , are five -tenths higher than they were in\nSeptember . So, you’ ve got —you had two months of higher inflation, September and October .\nAs I mentioned , November is, is back on track. But, you know, once again we ’ve, you know,\nwe’ve had a year -end projection for inflation and it ’s kind of fallen apart as we’ ve approached\nthe end of the year . So that is certainly a larg e factor in people ’s thinking. I can tell you that\nmight be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to\nexpectations . It’s still , you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent] . It’s way below\nwhere it was . But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know , as I\nmentioned, a s we think about further cuts, we ’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.\nWe have been moving sideways on 12- month inflation as the 12 -month window moves . That ’s\nin part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4 th quarter of 2023.\nNonetheless, as we go forward, we ’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing\ninflation down and keeping a solid labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thanks for taking\nthe question. In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nthrough” any new tariffs as long as they were one- time increases and inflation expectations\nremained anchored . Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other\nthinking on tariffs generally that you can share ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative\nsimulations are a good place to start . I happened to have brought them here with me today. I ’m\nsure you have them too. They’re, t hey’re a good starting point , and, and I would just say, you\nknow, it’ s six-years -old analysis . But nonetheless , this is still, I think , I think the right, the right\nquestions to ask. A nd, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “ seeing\nthrough,” one was not . And I point you to, you’ll — there’s some language in the —in the “ see-\nthrough” paragraph. I t says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to\n“see through ” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in , in which it might not\nbe.\nIn any case, this is not a question that ’s in front of us right now . We, we won ’t face that\nquestion—w e don’ t know when we ’ll face that question . What the Committee ’s doing now is , is\ndiscussing pathways and understanding, again , the ways in which tariff- driven inflation can\naffect —tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that . So, we’re,\nwe’re —we ’ve done a bit of , good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it\nputs us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be , to make ,\nyou know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy\nresponse.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow [-up]. Do you, given the recent bout\nof inflation that we ’ve been through, with consumers seeing how , you know, prices can rise and\nbusinesses being —seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nlittle bit riskier to look through tariffs? I mean , are—do you feel that you have to respond more\nquickly to inflation threats , given what we ’ve seen the past few years?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the, the main thing is —and this is also a point in these alternative\nsimulations —is that there ’re just many, many factors that go into what , what —how much tariffs\nwill, will even go into consumer inflation. How persistent will that be? And, you know, s o, we\njust—we just don’ t know , really , very much at all about the actual policies, so it ’s very\npremature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don’ t know what ’ll be tariffed , from what\ncountries, for how long, and what size . We don’ t know whether there ’ll be, you know,\nretaliatory tariffs . We don ’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be\ninto consumer prices .\nTo your —to your point as well, I don ’t—I wouldn’ t say that we know whether the last\nepisode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we ’ve just been through a\nperiod of high inflation. We’ve just gotten through that period. That ’s a difference . It was also\nquite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries , since that, that may —that\nmay have affects. I don’ t know . I just think we , we need to take our time, not rush, and make a\nvery careful assessment, but only when we ’ve actually seen what the policies are and how\nthey’ re implemented . And, you know, we ’re just—we ’re just not at that stage . We ’re at the\nstage of doing what other forecasters are doing —which is kind of thinking about these questions ,\nbut not , not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, to make sure\nI understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the\ncentral tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nCommittee sees the risks to those projections to the upside. So if inflation only declines next\nyear from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me —let me find these numbers . So we have —we have inflation\ncoming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year . That’s, that’d be—that’d\nbe significant progress . You see a slower path . I think that does take on board that we want to\nsee real progress. But we, we, you know, we ’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation\ndown to that level . That wouldn’ t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be , it would be , you\nknow, better than this year . This year , [it] wi ll be 2.8 or 2.9. That would be meaningful . We,\nwe also have to think about the , the, you know, the labor market . And while we , we have the\nlabor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling, so far in an orderly , gradual way. But it’ s also something we need to keep our\neye on.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I , I guess , if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these\nprojections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing ” language in the statement, which has\nbeen used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it ’s going to be on hold for a\nwhile , and they said, “ Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time ,” would they\nbe mistaken to , to infer that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s, that’s not the —that’s not any decision that we ’ve made at\nall. Let me explain “ extent and timing.” So the , the sense of that wording is to make clear that if\nthe economy does evolve about as anticipated, we ’re at a point at which it would be appropriate\nto slow the pace of rate cuts. So “ extent, ” that just relates to how , how much further we can\nreduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance . Clearly , that distance has\nshrunk by 100 basis points . So it ’s significantly smaller. So that ’s, that’s the “ extent ” question.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nAnd, again, we ’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor\nmarket, to make those cuts.\n“Timing ” just suggests , again , that we ’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy\ndevelops as expected, we’ re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of\nadjustments . So that, that ’s what we mean by that . We’ re not trying to make decisions about the\nlonger run. You know, we are, we ’re trying to make sensible policy as we go . And , you know, I\njust would emphasize the uncertainty , which is, it ’s just —it’s just a function of the fact that, that\nwe expect significant policy cha nges. There’s nothing really unusual about that . I think we need\nto, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We’ll, w e’ll have a\nmuch clearer picture , I think, you know, when that happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Even\nthough you’ ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven ’t seen much change in\nmortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates . You say you’ re significantly restrictive . Are you\nrunning a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of\na slowdown than you anticipate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the , the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are ,\nare really longer -run rates , and they ’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,\nbut they ’re also affected by many other things . And longer rates have actually gone up quite a\nbit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,\nmortgage rates more than short- term rates do . So we look at that, but we look at all financial\nconditions , and then we look at what ’s hap pening in the economy. S o what we see happening in\nthe economy, again, is , you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nfor a very long time, and it keeps not happening. So we have —we ’re now well into another year\nof growth. I t looks like it might be 2 ½ percent . Third and— second and third quarters were right\nabout at the same level . So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well . Substantially\nbetter than our global peer group. And I, I —there ’s no reason to think a downturn is , is any\nmore likely than it— than it usually is .\nSo, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy. We have to stay on task , though, and\ncontinue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent . We’re also\ngoing to be looking out for the labor market . We want to keep the labor market pretty close to\nwhere it is . We’re pretty close to estimates of the , the natural rate of unemployment. J ob\ncreation is , is a little below the , the level that would keep it there but , nonetheless, close. And so\nthat’s what our policy’ s trying t o achieve.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up by asking about —your formulation for\nbeginning rate cuts included the phrase “ we need to have confidence that inflation is moving\ndown towards our target .” Given the fact that you ’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you\nhave confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So confidence was our test for raising rates , and, you know, we ’ve\nmade —look , look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress. We’re, you\nknow, we’re well into the 2’ s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent] —or even lower than\nthat, we have been —for headline inflation . So I , I would say I ’m confident that inflation has\ncome down a great deal , and I, I ’m confident in the story about why it ’s come down and why\nthat portends well. And I ’ll—and I’ll tell you why. You, a gain, you do see with housing\nservices inflation, which is one that we ’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down\nnow quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought , you know, two years ago, but it ’s\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nnonetheless steadily coming down as , as market rents , you know, market rents start to equilibrate\nbetter with , you know, new leases that turn over . Not, not new tenants , but new leases. Market\nrents is new leases. So that, that ’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect .\nGoods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it\nwas before the pandemic . Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way\nbecause of used cars and things like that . But we think, overall , that should generally be in the\nrange it was in . Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market -based nonhousing services are\nin, in good shape . It’s nonmarket services, and those are —those are services that are imputed\nrather than measured directly , and they, they don ’t, we , we think they don’ t really tell us much\nabout the , you know, about tightness in the economy. They don’ t really reflect that. I mean , a\ngood example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just —so that,\nthat’s how that inflation works .\nSo the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact .\nIn particular , the labor market —look at the labor market . It’s, it is cooler by so many measures\nnow—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent . So\nit’s not a source of inflationary pressures . Not to say there aren ’t regional and , and, you know,\nparticular professions where labor is tight . But , overall, you’ re not getting inflationary impulses\nof any significance from the labor market.\nSo what ’s the story? The story is still just, we ’re unwinding from these large shocks that\nthe economy got in 2021 and ’ 22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in\ninsurance , in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing\ninsurance . It’s real inflation, but it doesn’ t portend persistently high inflation . So we and most\nother forecasters still feel that we ’re on track to , you know, to get down to 2 percent . It might\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ntake another year or two from here, but I, I ’m confident that that’ s the path we ’re on. And, you\nknow, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times . So the\nunemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead -up to the\n50 basis point cut in September . Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors . But now\nthe Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings . So what has changed\nabout the Committee ’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market? Is there just less\nconcern now on that front , or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now\nneeds to be accounted for?\nCHAIR POWELL. The , the unemployment rate has now —is now the same as it was in\nJuly: 4.2 percent . It’s moved up and down, but it ’s now the same as July . And job creation is , is\nlower than it has been, but it ’s been —it’ s been steady —it’s not —it’s not declining . It’s been\nsteady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would\nhold the unemployment rate constant , but it ’s not so far below . So, you might —you might —if,\nif we have the , the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue —job creation continues at that\nlevel in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing. So gradually declining. But we don’ t have that kind of precision in this .\nSo, but you’ re right, though, and I , I read out some of the reasons . We, we do think the\nlabor market is still cooling by many measures, and we ’re watching that closely . It’s, it’s not\ncooling in a —in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think , you know, you pointed\nout participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nto the labor market. And it ’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it\ndoesn’ t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that. Nonetheless, you know, we ’re\nwatching it closely.\nCOLBY SMITH. If, if the idea , though, is that no additional kind of softening in the\nlabor market is welcome here, what ’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I —what I said is, we don ’t think we need further softening to get\nto 2 percent inflation . That ’s what I ’m saying, n ot that it ’s not welcome. We don’ t need it , we\ndon’t think . If, if you had a situation where inflation’ s moving around by a tenth every few\nmonths, that ’s, you know, we ’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent\nmonths been moving sideways in the 12- month window . And so we ’ve got to weigh them both,\nat this point. You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused\non, on inflation. We’ ve now gotten to a place where , where the risks of the two are what we\nthink are broadly, roughly in ba lance. And so that ’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr. Chairman, I , I did not hear you use the word “ recalibration ”\ntoday. And I ’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this\nnew phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it\nwas before. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . We’ re not —we ’re not renaming the phase —yet . But we may get\naround to that . But , no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in , in a new phase in the process, as I\nsaid. So, and that ’s just because we’ ve reduced —we ’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis\npoints . We ’re significantly closer to neutral. We still think where we are is meaningfully ,\nmeaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward , you know, it’ s appropriate to move\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ncautiously and look for progress on inflation. We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support\neconomic activity by cutting 100 basis points , and that ’s a good thing. I, I think it would—I\nsupport the decision, and , and I think it was the right decision to make . I think from now we are\nin a place where the risks really are in balance , and we need to see progress on inflation. And\nthat’s, that ’s how we ’re thinking about it . So it is kind of a new thing. We moved pretty quickly\nto get to here , and I think going forward, obviously, we ’re going to be moving slower , which is\nconsistent with , with the SEP.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the\nCommittee are looking through some of the high numbers we ’ve had in the recent inflation\nnumbers . For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the\navian flu, that , that kind of stuff . And , and then looking forward, perhaps , to housing inflation\ncoming down, as it did in the recent report.\nCHAIR POWELL . So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the\nnumbers we don’ t like, you know? It ’s just a, an occupational hazard is , is to [say] , “Look, those\nhigh months are wrong.” What about the low months? You know, w e’ve got, we have a very\nlow month, potentially, in November . You know, i t’s estimated by many to be in the mid- teens\nfor core PCE . So that could be idiosyncratically low . We try to look— we try to look at not just\na couple or three months . We shouldn’ t have —our , our position shouldn’ t change based on two\nor three months of good or bad data . We have a long string now of inflation coming down\ngradually over time . As I mentioned, 12- month, I think it ’s 12-month headline ’s 2½; 12-month\ncore is 2.8. That’s way better than we were. We still have some work to do , though, is how\nwe’re looking at it. And w e need policy to remain restrictive to , to get —to get that work done ,\nwe think.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN . Thanks Chair, Chair Powell . Neil Irwin from Axios . Financial markets\nhave been very buoyant , really all year . Is the Committee comfortable with where financial\nconditions are , or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine\nprogress on your inflation target?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we , we do look carefully at financial conditions , of course ; that’s\npart of what we do. But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our —\nof our goal variables and , and how are we affecting the economy . So what we ’ve seen over the\ncourse of —just take the last year . We, we’ve seen inflation —well, over the last couple of\nyears—come down a lot . We’ ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit. That suggests that\nour policy is restrictive .\nWe’ve, w e can also look more directly at , at the parts of the economy that are affected\nby—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing. Housing activity is , is very low,\nand that ’s partly , significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working. I t’s\ntransmitting , and it ’s having the effects o n our goal variables that we would want . You know, a\nlot of things move financial conditions around, as you know , and we don’ t really control those .\nBut I ’d say we , we see the effects we ’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and , and the\nplaces where we’ d expect to see it.\nNEIL IRWIN . So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do\nyou see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, you know, we, we ’re not allowed to own B itcoin . The Federal\nReserve Act says what we can own , and we’re, we’re not looking for a , a law change. That ’s the\nkind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Hey, happy holidays , Mr. Chairman . Thanks for taking our\nquestions . I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’ re confident\nthat we ’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years\nago.\nCHAIR POWELL . I think it ’s pretty clear we’ ve avoided a recession . I think growth\nthis year has , has been solid, it really has . PDFP, private domestic f inal p urchases, which , which\nwe think is the best indicator of private demand , is looking to come in around 3 percent [real\ngrowth] this year . This is a really good number . Again, the U.S. economy has just been\nremarkable . And it ’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the\nstory , is that how well the U.S. is doing. And if you look around the world, there ’s just a lot of\nslow growth and continu ed struggle s with inflation . So I feel —I feel very good about where the\neconomy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the —you, you\nguys have noted that the unemployment rate is , is still low . However , employment rates have\nfallen rather quickly . The prime -age employment rate has fell by about half a point —half a\npercent , rather—recently . The question, I guess , is, do you think there ’s maybe more downside\nmomentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?\nCHAIR POWELL . I don’ t think so, no. I think , overall , if you look at it, prime -age\nparticipation is still very high . What, w hat’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is\nlow. So if you—if you have a job , you ’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right? So\npeople are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers . If you are looking\nfor a job , though, the hiring rate is low , and that ’s a signal of , of lower demand, and it has come\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ndown. So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further\nsoftening . I didn’ t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in\nthe labor market. Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation . And , you\nknow, that ’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the\naction, with, with an additional cut . So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is\nvery low —again, participation is high . Wages are at a healthy and , and ever more sustainable\nlevel —wage growth. And so the labor market —this is a good , a good labor market, and , you\nknow, we want to keep it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Amara .\nAMARA OMEOKWE . Thank you. Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News . I just\nwant to put a finer point on the labor market . Can you keep the labor market this way, in the\nstrong position that you have described, without further cuts? In other words, do you still view\nthe labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, we, w e can ’t know that with any tremendous certainty . I,\nI will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks —we think the risks are roughly in\nbalance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is , is in solid shape . And\nwhen I say it ’s softening or cooling, it ’s very gradual process . You know, j ob creations are, are\nmeaningfully positive ; wages are, you know, if anything, a little , still a bit above what would be\nsustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer- run trend. If you, if you take into account\nthe high productivity readings we ’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to\n2 percent inflation .\nSo, again, I , I don’ t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the\ndownsides clearly appear to have diminished. Nonetheless, it ’s, it’s one of our mandate goals ,\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nand, you know, we pay close attention to it , and it ’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually\ncooling—g radually and in an orderly way. And , and, you know, that ’s, that’s how I would\ncharacterize it , and that ’s why we ’re paying careful attention.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much, Chair Powell . Elizabeth Schulze from ABC\nNews . As you ’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year . High prices are\nstill a burden for so many households right now . Why do you think it is that inflation is proving\nto be more stubborn than you’ d expected?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, it, i t breaks down into a long answer , if you want, but it\njust has been a little bit more stubborn . I think if you go back two or three years, many people\nwere saying that to get this far down we would’ ve had to have a , had a deep recession and , you\nknow, high unemployment by now . Well, that has not been the case, so , you know, the , the path\ndown has actually been much better than many predicted. We , we’ve managed to, to have the\nunemployment rate remain essentially at its longer -run natural rate , while inflation has come\ndown from —you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a\n12-month basis . So that’s, that ’s a pretty good outcome .\nWhy hasn’ t it come down [more]? One reason is that , that —just a technical issue around\nthe way we calculate housing services, and that , that process has been slower than —market rents\nhave, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three , two , two\nyears ago . So that ’s part of it.\nI think there are other, other parts of the story, but , you know, the, the —what , what I\nthink people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we, we\nunderstand very well that prices went up by a great deal , and people really feel that . And it ’s\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nprices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that . So there ’s\ntremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the\nadvanced economies at the same time. So now we have —inflation itself is way down , but\npeople are still feeling high prices , and that is —that is really what people are feeling . The best\nwe can do for them —and that ’s who we work for —is to get inflation back down to its target and\nkeep it there so that people are earning , you know, big, real wage increases so that their , their\nwages are going up, their , their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year\nupon year . And that ’s what will restore people ’s good feeling about the economy. That’s what it\nwill take, and that ’s what we ’re aiming for.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the\nbiggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?\nCHAIR POWELL . I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is , and, honestly,\nI’m very optimistic about , about the economy, and it ’s—we ’re, we’re in a really good place ; our\npolicy ’s in a really good place . I, I expect another good year next year.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thanks , Chair Powell, for doing the questions . Edward\nLawrence from F ox Business. So you say that we ’re closer to the neutral rate. What percent do\nyou see , and the Committee believes —where is that neutral rate?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I ’ll say a couple things . First of all, when we , when we write —\nthe thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer -run neutral rate,\nwhich is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy ’s in\nbalance, and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now . So when\nwe’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that ’s not the question we ’re asking. So you can’ t do a\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nstraight read between those longer -run numbers that we write down and what we think the\nappropriate policy should be . So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the\neconomy. And so what we ’re doing in, in real time is we ’re looking at our policy stance , and\nwe’re looking at the way it’ s hitting the economy, and, particularly , we look at the effects it ’s\nhaving as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.\nAnd the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are —that are\nlasting but not permanent . And the , the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r *.\nThe ones that are, could be lasting, but , but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually\naffect what, what ’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we ’re\nlooking at that , and, you know, we don’t —we don ’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,\nwe know it by its works, and I think what , what we know for sure is that we ’re 100 basis points\ncloser to it right now . There are many estimates of where that might be , and we know we ’re a lot\ncloser to it , and I think we ’re in a good place . But I think from here it ’s a new phase, and we ’re\ngoing to be , you know, cautious about , about further cuts.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . But , but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little\nmore clarity . I mean , I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent . You know, I, I think\nthe markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where\nthat, that goalpost , for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment , it looks big.\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah, I mean , honestly, we —you know, there are countless models\nof what —of what a neutral rate might be at any given time . There , there are empirical models,\nthere are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you ’d like . So there is no real certainty . And, I mean , it’s, it’s actually a good thing\nto know that we don’ t know exactly where it is , so you’ re not —you’ re not tempted to think, “Oh,\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nI think this model or this estimate is right. ” You , you just have to be open to, you know, the\nempirical data that are coming in and also how it ’s affecting the outlook. And it ’s not made any\neasier by the fact that , you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags .\nNonetheless, that is the job we have , and so we ’re, we’re — I think we need— i t’s\nappropriate for us —for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we ’re 100 basis points closer to ,\nto neutral, and we ’ll do so. Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in , in good shape , and these\ncuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make\nprogress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico . I just wanted to make sure I\nunderstood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation. Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up? And then also,\nsince that ’s what ’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that? Why , why do\nyou all see core PCE going down and, potentially , headline inflation ticking up?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, and as , as I imagine you know, the , you know, the goal overall is\nheadline inflation, because that ’s what people experience. People don’ t experience core\ninflation ; they experience inflation, a nd that includes food and energy costs . So that ’s the overall\ngoal. But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can\nfluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation. So it tu rns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of\noverall inflation than overall inflation is . So we look at core inflation because it ’s a better\nmeasure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be , because it ’s a better measure of , of\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nwhat inflation pressures exist . So that ’s, that’s —it’ s complicated, but ultimately , we, you know,\nour goal is headline, not core . So your question was, your second question was what?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially\nticking up?\nCHAIR POWELL . So headline can be affected —you’ re talking about next year.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Mm -hmm .\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and\nfood prices . So that, there, there will be things in , in the headline forecast s that are to do with\nforecasts of energy prices, w hereas core will be —if, if you look at core going out a full year,\nthen it ’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy. So it—that, that ’s why\nthe two can go in different directions . Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year ,\nbut that ’s because energy prices hav e been coming down, w hich is a great thing for people . But\nenergy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’ t really be telling us anything\nabout how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’ re thinking about\nenergy prices?\nCHAIR POWELL . So w e, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but , you know,\nbut—really carefully , rather . But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven ’t really —\nnothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States\neconomy. The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we ’re talking\nabout the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that , that is a good summary\nstatistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil . But the price of\noil’s been coming down, and, for , because of supply conditions, global supply conditions . So we\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ndon’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really , the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly ,\nat a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil. A nd it remains , you know, a risk.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Kelly.\nKELLY O ’GRADY. Thanks , Chair Powell . Kelly O ’Grady from CBS News . I want to\ngo back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now . It\nwasn ’t the case for some time , of course . It’s partly why Americans haven ’t felt much relief in\ntheir wallets from prices yet. But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in\nclosing that gap could go away?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah , so inflation —again, we don’ t overreact to a couple of months\nof higher readings or a couple months of lower readings . And we, what we ha d was —we had\nfour months of really nice readings , and then September and October were higher, but then\nNovember is much lower . So I don’ t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising\nupside risk to inflation. I, I think inflation is much lower. What the public is feeling , and they’ re\nright about it, is that prices are , are just—the p rice level went up , because of the past inflation . It\nis going to take some time to, for real wages to recover , over a period of years in which your ,\nyour real compensation is growing . And, in other words, your compensation’ s growing\nmeaningfully faster than inflation . That ’s exactly the kind of economy we have now , and we just\nwant to hold onto it . That , that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what ’s\ngoing on right now . And I don’ t think that , you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation\nreally signal that , anything of the nature you’ re suggesting.\nKELLY O ’GRADY. And just one follow -up: Let’s look more long- term. You\npreviously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026 . It’s now been pushed out to\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\n2027. You said you’ re focused on enabling further progress on inflation . That’s not necessarily\nprogress in the right direction . Are you confident that target isn ’t going to move further out?\nCHAIR POWELL . We’ re talking about —when you’ re projecting the economy, you\nknow, three years out, two years out, you’ re talking about high uncertainty. Very high\nuncertainty. You know, we, w e really —at that point it, it ’s not, it ’s not possible to confidently\npredict where the economy is going to be in three years . So what we ’re doing is we ’re looking at\nwhat ’s happening now . And we ’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are\nhappening —so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods\nand services —goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,\ntheir prior level. A ll of those things should happen over time , and, and, you know, those pieces\ncome together . There’s every reason to think that they will . The timing of it is highly uncertain .\nYou know, but you’ re not wrong, though, that , you know, we ’ve, the — it’s been a bit\nfrustrating because the —while we ’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped .\nNonetheless, we ’re still on track . And, you know, I think if you’d —if two, two years ago , you’ d\nsaid, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people\nwould be, would say, “ I’ll take that.” I mean , that, that ’s a pretty good interim place to be . Job’ s\nnot done , but, but I think we ’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we ’re headed.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer from\nMarketplace . You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways . You know, i t\nappears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent . Do you think the Fed is just going to\nhave to settle for that and accept that you ’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?\n\nDecember 18 , 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL . No, we ’re not going to settle for that. I think we ’re, we’re, you\nknow, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we ’ll get inflation back\nsustainably to 2 percent . That is —and I am confident we will achieve that . It has taken longer,\nbut it ’s, you have to be —you know, we are making progress. W e have made a great deal of\nprogress . And we ’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation . That ’s what we owe\nthe public . And, and, you know, we ’re committed to achieving it.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?\nCHAIR POWELL . You don’ t rule things completely in or out in this —in this world .\nThat doesn’ t appear to be a likely outcome. I think we ’re at 4.3 percent . That’s, t hat’s\nmeaningfully restrictive , and I , I think it’ s a well -calibrated rate for us to continue to make\nprogress on inflation while , while keeping a , a strong labor market .\nSo—Thank you very much."
