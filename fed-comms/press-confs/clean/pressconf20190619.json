  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I have one\noverarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices,\nfor the benefit of the American people.\nAt the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but\nmade some significant changes to our statement. Since the beginning of the year, we have\njudged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in\nassessing the need for any changes. In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation\npressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of\nincoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the\nexpansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective.\nI’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings\nus to today’s decision. So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid\nfundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment. Inflation has been running\nsome what below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth\nand a strong job market. Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some\nongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth. At the\ntime of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these\ncrosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and\nthere were reports of progress in trade negotiations wi th China. Our continued patient stance\nseemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.\nIn the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged. Growth indicators\nfrom around the world have disappointe d, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the\n\nglobal economy. Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in\nbusiness and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. These concerns\nmay have contr ibuted to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be\nstarting to show through to incoming data . Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated\nas well. Against this back drop, inflation remains muted.\nWhile the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties\nwill continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy\naccommodation. Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more\naccommodative policy has st rengthened. Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting\nwith th e outlook for jobs and growth.\nParticipants see unemployment remaining low this year and next. Monthly job gains in\nMay were lower than expected, however, and , in light of recent developments , this bears\nwatching. Still, many labor market indicators remain strong. Community, business, and labor\nleaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better , and that this is true\neven for those who have traditionally struggled to find work. Wages are rising, and this is\nparticularly so for lower -paying jobs.\nCommittee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with\na central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimate s of longer -run normal\ngrowth. The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the\ncomposition of growth. Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter,\nwhich had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting. As I noted then, the\nunexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories —components that are not\ngenerally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the\n\neconomy are spending on consumption and business investment. While consumption was weak\nin the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid\npace. In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business\nfixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1 Moreover, manufacturing production has posted\ndeclines so far this year. Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC\nparticipants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I\nmentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen.\nAfter running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation\ndeclined in the first quarter. Data since th en show some pickup. Participants broadly see\ninflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been\nexpected. The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy\ncomponents , is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent.\nSetting aside short -term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about\nthe pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent. Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace\nthat would provide much upward impetus to inflation. Moreover, weaker global growth may\ncontinue to hold i nflation down around the world.\nWe are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well\naware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could pre cipitate a\ndifficult- to-arrest downward drift in longer -run inflation expectations. Because there are no\ndefinitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies. Market -based\nmeasures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting , and some survey -\nbased expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges. Combining these\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.\n\nfactors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more\nsustained shortfall of inflation.\nOverall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain\nenvironment. The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that\nsome cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely.\nThough some parti cipants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made\nclear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional\naccommodation has strengthened since our May meeting. This added accommodation would\nsupport economic activity and inflat ion’s return to our objective.\nUncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.\nIt is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short -\nterm swing in sentiment. Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.\nThus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to\nweigh on the outlook, a nd we will use our tools as appropriate to sus tain the expansion.\nThank you. I will be pleased to take your questions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, did you consider\na rate cut today ? Specifically , was it one of the options —the policy options in the Teal book?\nAnd is the Committee considering moving , given all the uncertainty you addressed , moving its—\nchanging its policy before the next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of\nglobal and domestic economic and financial co nditions and then spent this morning talking about\nmonetary policy. And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we ’re going to be\nmonitoring —monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we ’ve mentioned, but that\n\nwe’d like to see more going forward. Particularly, we ’d like to see whether these risks co ntinue\nto weigh on the outlook.\nSo, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight\nof those , a strengthen ed case for cutting rates. Eight actuall y wrote down rate cuts . A number of\nothers see that the case ha s strengthened . But the Committee wanted to see more, as I\nmentioned. And I also mentioned that some of these —some of these developments have been of\nquite recent vintage . And so we do expect that we’ ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues\nin the near term. And that ’s our focus.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Do you think something could change before the next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting. I expect a\nfull range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at. I think we ’ll learn\na great deal more about them . And I think that ’s—we think that that ’s the right way to move\nhere. Again, many of these developments happened , you know, part of the way through the last\nintermeeting period. Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last\nFOMC meeting feeling that the economy , and our policy , was in a good place. So we want to\nsee—we want to see and w e want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are\ngenuine , and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment , which can be volatile.\nAt the same time, we are —we ’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are pre pared to\nmove and use our tools as needed t o sustain the expansion.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Could you walk us through\nyour thinking about trade? It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least\nthe market to become definitively banking , or—pricing in rate cuts . If, for example, there ’s a\ndeal with China, does that take the possibil ity of rate cuts off the table?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye ah, so I would say that we ’re not looking at any one thing. I guess\nI would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver\nof sentiment in the intermeeting period. But we ’re also looking at global growth. It ’s really\ntrade developments and concerns about globa l growth that are on our minds.\nSo we ’re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data. Risks seem to have\ngrown. In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that ’s been pretty good,\nparticularly for the consumer : Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy\njob market, high levels of employment, wages going up. We do see , though, some areas that\nwe’re looking at , such as , I mentioned, business fixed income.2 So—also , the prolonged\nshortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’ t like to look at one job report . We like to\naverage over three or six months, but still that bears watching.\nSo we ’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S.\neconomic outlook. We expect to learn a good deal more , as I mentioned. And we ’ll be asking\nthe question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook. And then, in the\nend, we ’ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. Could you clarify\nwhat you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as\nFed Chair?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the law is clear that I have a four -year term , and I fully intend\nto serve it.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. I was hoping that —this is Jeanna Smialek from\nthe New York Times. I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you ’re thinking\n\n2 Chair Powell intended to say “business fixed investment.”\n\nabout the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely —sort\nof, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we ’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say\nthat, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt , though, that\nthe right thing to do was to wait and see more. And we will see a lot more on all of these issues\nin the very near term. So I don ’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now. I\nwould say , as a general matter, it ’s always something that we h ave to weigh. But I think we\nbelieve that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks\nunfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. [Inaudible]\nCHAIR POWELL. Obviously , we try to av oid going prematurely as well. In this case,\nyou know, there ’s always some judgment in these things. But I would just say that the risks that\nwe see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of\nus to write down rate cuts , and a number of those who haven’ t to see that the case has\nstrengthened.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You had your first dissent in\nyour time as C hairman. Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that was\npushing for a rate cut this time? And how do you —do you expect further dissents going\nforward?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time , before there\nhad been a ny dissents, a nd that is that I think the process of careful , thoughtful dissent is a very\nhealthy one, and I ’ve always believed that . And I feel like you make better decisions when you\n\nhear a disparity of views . So I really do look at it that way. I would add, though, that the support\nfor the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad.\nJAMES POLITI. James Politi with the Financial Times. Mario Draghi at the ECB\nyesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone . Do you think that such actions\nto ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pres sure on the Fed to do the\nsame?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic —\ntheir mandates are domestic , and they ’re focused on economic conditions from a domesti c\nstandpoint. And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all\ncentral banks . So that ’s our principal focus. So it could cut either way. You know, I would\nthink that , to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB\nafter a rate cut, that would support —tend to support activity.3 So we ’re really focused on, you\nknow, the risks to our —on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the\nrisks to those outlooks. That ’s our principal focus.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. This is the first time that you ’ve been really issuing\nSEPs in an era when rates are going to be going down. Just two sort of related question s: Is\nthere concern that you ’ll be causing a sort of “ dot deflation ” by telling people, “W ell, don’ t buy\nyour car now , because it ’ll get cheaper in six months because we’ re cutting rates, ” and that that\ncould sort of fulfill itself ? And , secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected\nPCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility\nin terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?\n\n3 Chair Powell intended to say “stronger activity in the euro area.”\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ll take th e inflation one first. I didn’ t quite follow your “ dot”\nquestion.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well , the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to—\nHoward Schneider with Reuters —went from 1.8 to 1.5, it ’s the fact that you ’re not responding to\nthat.\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s the inflation question.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m saying you —\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. On de f—no, the fact that you ’ve signaled rate cuts are\ncoming . Or is—was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell\npeople , “Don’t borrow now, don’ t spend now , because rates will get cheaper later ”?\nCHAIR POWELL. I see. Okay , right. Okay . So let me let me answer the inflation\nquestion first. So we ’re saying that we know —I noted in the statement and also in my —what I\nsaid here. We saw that market -based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens , dropped.\nWe noted that also in the statement. And I noted it as a reason for us to —one of several reasons\nwhy it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened. So we find that\nnotable. Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants ,\ndropped a couple of tenths. So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.\nLet me say , on inflation, it ’s something I ’ve been concerned about for quite a long time.\nIt’s one of the principal reasons why I called fo r the review . In a world where policy rates are\ngoing to be closer to the effective lower bound, t hen, just as a general matter, we need to be\nreally strong on 2 percent inflation. So I think, you know, we certainly don ’t want to be seen as\nweak on infla tion, and I don't believe we are.\n\nIn terms of the dots, you’ re right , this is the first time , I believe, we ’ve had —we’ve talk ed\nabout cutting in the “ dot era. ” I guess the dot era began in January 2012. And, you know, we ’re\nworking our way through it. A nd I think it ’s just something we do. You know that my view on\nthe dots is that they , overall , provide useful information for people , but that we need to do our\nabsolute best to explain what they are and what they are not.\nSpeaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they ’re not discussed or debated\nat the meeting, they ’re an input to policy more than an output of policy , and they ’re also only the\nmost likely case. So , in a situation where there ’s relatively high uncertainty, the re’s the most\nlikely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely. But that doesn ’t\nshow up in the dot. The dot is either one thing or it ’s another. So I just would say that , if you\npay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture.\nCHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr.\nChairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there ’ll be a debate over\nwhether to move by 25 or 50 basis points. Indeed , there’ s a pretty substantial body of academic\nliterature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more\naggressively than it otherwise would. I’m w ondering what you think of that prescription, and if\nyou could spe nd a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50 basis point cut and\nhow you approach that question.\nCHAIR POWELL. On the specific question of that , that ’s just something we haven ’t\nreally engaged with yet , and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk\n\npicture as we move forward. So it would be —so nothing I can say about that is specific to the\nnear-term question that we face.\nMore generally , though, the research you refer to essentially notes that , in a world where\nyou are closer to the effective lower bound, i t’s why —research kind of shows this —it’ s wise to\nreact , for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening . In other\nwords, sort of , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So I think that is a valid way to\nthink about policy in this era. I don ’t know —and it ’s always in the —I think it ’s in the minds of\npolicymakers, you know, during this era, because it ’s well understood to be correct. Again, I\ndon’t know what that means in t erms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward. That ’s\ngoing to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Thanks , Chairman Powell. Democratic\npresidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in\norder to address concerns about rising trade deficits . The President himself has routinely\ncomplained about the strength of the U.S. dollar , saying i t has resulted in , quote, “tremendous ,”\nclose quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others. Do you think that an\novervalued dollar has been a drag on America’s global competitiveness? And would you support\nan intervent ion of some kind on this issue?\nCHAIR POWELL. The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy , not\nthe Fed, and we don’t comment , in that sense , on the level of the dollar. We have the\nresponsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use ou r tools to achieve that.\n\nOf course, we do that through changing financial conditions , and one of those is the dollar, but\nwe don’t target the dollar. It’s just something that we don’t do.\nIn fact, central banks —or, rather , nations , when they get together , routinely adopt a\ncommunique that says we will target our domestic , economic , and financial conditions and not\nour exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the\nG-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago. So I’m not the right person to ask about that\nsort of dollar policy intervention.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman Powell . Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones. If the\nmost —according to the dot plot, I mean —if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates\nin the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react\nsooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now? Why\nnot just cut them now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, why not now? And, I would say , there was not much support for\ncutting rates now at this meeting. There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate\ncuts. But all of those , but apparently one , felt that it would be better to see more to —before\nmoving. And I gave a co uple of reasons why that is the case. First , it’s just the fact that some of\nthese developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain. So we felt that it\nwould be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would , in fact , learn a lot about\nthese developments in the near term. Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves\nis, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook? And we will act as needed,\nincluding promptly , if that’s appropriate , and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. Thank you for doing this, Chairman. Edward Lawrence\nfrom Fox Business Network. How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?\n\nYou know, on one hand, you have str ong overall growth. C onsumer spending is strong. On the\nother hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in jobs but coming\nin a little weaker, and then you have low inflation. And then, specifically, what data are you\nlooking at that you decided not to have a rate cut? Why didn’t you do that? [0:24:15.5]\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you gave a pretty good picture. I mean, it’s a complicated\npicture , and , you know , the answer is , we look at all of it. But I would say , the big pieces of it\nare this : The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer\nspending coming back up in the second quarter . That is coming true. And consumer spending is\nat a healthy level , and that makes sense. You’ve got a tight labor market. You’ve got companies\nin surveys saying that labor is scarce. You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are\nplentiful. You’ve got wages going up. You’ve got high levels of household confidence. So, all\nof that , underlyin g fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy , which is\n70 percent of the economy , is quite solid. Job creation, if you take a three -month average , is still\nwell above, you know, the entry —level of entry into the workforce. So that part of the economy\nis solid.\nYou mentioned manufacturing , and we’re seeing this all around the world.\nManufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker. It’s not solely a domestic issue , and it\nmay be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that, including, for example, what\nChina has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage. Some of it\nmay be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments. The Boeing 737 issues\nmay be contributing in their own way . So the re—lower oil prices are contributing to lower\ninvestment , although they’re also leading to lower gas prices , which support s spending. So there\nare many, many things. There isn’t any one thing that explains it all. But it’s something tha t\n\nwe’re watching. But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of\nweak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to\nlow unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of t he two big pieces of it that\nyou see.\nThen you see the crosscurrents . If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that —concerns\nabout global growth and trade developments —you have the full picture. And I think what that\npicture —what we took away from that pic ture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these\nrisks , and what we want to do is , we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon\nthe outlook.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and R adio. If consumer\nspending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I’d like to get your\nthinking on what a Fed rate cut would do? Have you modeled the additional growth and\ninflation you might get from a rate cut? Can you identi fy any sectors that would benefit from a\nlower cost of capital ? Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we have the tools we have , and we’re committed and sworn to\nuse them to support economic activity . And they do support economic activity through a number\nof channels that are reasonably well understood— some more directly tied to interest rates than\nothers. But we do generally believe that —that our interest rate policy can support demand and\nsupport business investment as well. And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as\nappropriate to achieve our objective s, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just\nmake a note of that.\nThe reason why we say “ sustain the expansion” is, you’re see ing now , for the first time,\nyou know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t\n\nbeen earlier. You’re 10 years deep into this , and that’s something we heard quite a lot at the\nconference in Chicago on the review . And I just would say , that’s why we think —it’s one of the\nreasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really\nare benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time.\nMICHAEL M CKEE. But g iven your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed\npolicy can solve those problems?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we take the— you know , we take the crosscurrents as a given , and\nwe have our tools. You know, we don’t —we react to anything in princ iple that could undermine\nour achievement of our dual -mandate goals —maximum employment, stable prices —is worthy of\nour attention and can call forth a policy response. And that’s just how we look at it.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. Y ou’ve said that the Fed doesn’t\ntake short -term political considerations into account, and you’ve defended the Fed’ s\nindependence. So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that , publicly or\nprivately , you should push back on the President’s criticisms rather than ignoring him? And\nalso, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary\npolicy?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know , I don’t —I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or\nprivately , really . So I would just say that we are —at the Fed , we’re deeply committed to\ncarrying out our mission, a nd also that our independence from direct political control we see as\nan important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well.\nNANCY MARS HALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this\n\nweek , could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy? And did\nanyone from Fa cebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central\nbank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that. And, of course , the—so I think we’re a long\nway from that. Digital currencies are in their infancy. So, essentially, not too concerned about,\nyou know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of\ncryptocurrencies or digital currencies.\nYou know, Facebook, I believ e, has made quite broad rounds in —around the world really\nwith regulator s, supervisors , and lots of people to discuss their plans , and that certainly includes\nus. And we’re —you know, it’s something we’re looking at. We meet with a broad range of\nprivate -sector firms all the time on financial technology , and there’s just a tremendous amount of\ninnovation going on out there. You know, there are potential benefits here . There are also\npotential risks , particularly of a currency that could, you know, that c ould potentially have large\napplication. So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having\nquite high expectations , from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do\ndecide to go forward with something .\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Do you think the Fed will be involved in regulating\nLibra then?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we have —we don’t have plenary authority over\ncryptocurrencies as such. They play into our world through consumer protection and money\nlaunde ring and things like that. But , I would say that, you know, through international forums,\nyou know, we have significant input into the payment system and, as you know , play an\nimportant role in the payment system here in the United States.\n\nGREG ROBB. Tha nk you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I want to\ntake you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy. And something\ninteresting, I think, is developing , is that outside experts are excited and are—like the idea of the\nFed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent —around there , roughly , I guess. They think\nthat that would, you know, help monetary policy , and that there ’s no—2 percent is not , like ,\nsanctimonious or anything , or whatever , sacred. It seems that you ’ve taken that off the table. So\nI was wondering if you could discuss that . Have you taken it off the table ? And then, if so , why ,\nor—and what ’s your thoughts on that ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’ t look at raising the tar get rate\nfor inflation. We did say that. And the reason is , it’s become a global norm , 2 percent . Our\nstatutory mandate is price stability. And so we ’re actually taking a less —we’re looking at less\nradical ideas , such as how to make the 2 percent infla tion objective more credible.\nThis gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in\nparticular. So it ’s a new thing for us . It’s something that —I thought it was both appropriate and\nimportant for us to do. It ’ll be a yearlong , or even longer , process , looking at our strategy , tools ,\nand communications. And it ’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in,\nand have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve. We ’ve had a series of Fed\nListens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier\nthis month , with seven papers written and criticized , and leading global experts.\nBut I ’ll just say , again , that the heart of the conference was the two panels on —with\npractitioners in low and moderate income —who live in low - and moderate -income communities\nand are part of those communities. And they were —there, I think, people were quite struck by\ntheir intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is\n\nand what it means in their communities. You know, the idea being , they haven ’t had, you know,\na bull market in these communities. They haven ’t had , just , a booming economy. What they\nhave had is low unemployment, lots of social problems. And just now , you have, you know,\ncompanies who want to hire and are bringing people into the —providing opportunities for\npeople to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time.\nAnd that is , I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing\nand motivating , too. So I think everybody thought, you know, that ’s—that was really quite\nworth doing. I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—s ome people\nrecommended that we just talk to, you know , econ Ph .D.’s about this, but , no, that ’s not what we\nchose to do, and we ’re glad this is the choice we made.\nGREG ROBB. But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke,\nthey—when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind\nof shrugged their shoulders, you know? So—is 4 percent inflation radical ? And to who?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don ’t think it’ s—I don’ t think it’ s a practical alternative. And I ’ll\ntell you why. I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world. You see central banks\nhaving a hard time getting inflation up to their —close to their objective. We ’ve done better than\nother large central banks that are not, you know, open e conomies , like the U.K., where you have\nbig currency moves that move inflation around. So—but it ’s quite challenging to get inflation —\nit’s been —even with very high level s of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not\ngetting back up to tar get in a sustained , symmetric kind of a way. So saying that you’ re going to\ngo for 4 percent —I wonder how credible that will be.\nJOHN HELTMAN. John Heltman with American Banker. I have a question about the\nFed’s—or, I guess , the b ank r egulators ’ leverag ed lending guidance from 2013. As you know,\n\nthe GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule , and it sort of went away. But yet\nleveraged lending is a source of concern . You yourself have said that credit underwriting quality\nseems to be deteriorating somewhat lately , and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to\nprevent leverage d lending from becoming too much of an issue. I want to know what the —is the\n2013 guidance still representative of the , sort of , Fed’s thinking about lever aged lending? And\ndoes the Fed have any intent —intention to either issue , like , a leveraged lending rule or a new\nguidance that is less problematic ? Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as\nyou’re—as you are?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the 2013 guidance is not binding , and that ’s what came out of the\nGAO review. But that ’s really the beginning of this —of the story. You know, we have the\nauthority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure. So, this —the first\nthing you star t with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves\nthrough their portfolio, through the risks that they ’re running and the pipeline —you know, the\nobligations that they ’ve undertaken to underwrite deals. And so we monitor that very\ncarefully —so do the banks —and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before\nthe crisis. And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests . We impose very large\nlosses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is , whereas before the crisis,\nthere was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be. So that ’s where it starts for\nus in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running —you know, running on their own books\nand to themselves and t o each other. So, in that, I feel —I feel like that is —that’s in a good place ,\nbut we never —we never say “Mission accomplished” on that. We will keep— you know, keep\nmonitoring that carefully.\n\nWhat ’s happened, though, is , the paper is now owned by market -based vehicles :\ncollateralized loan obligations, mutual funds , and things like that. And so we now have —you\nknow, we have a good sense of , domestically , of where that paper is. I think, internationally , not\nas much , and the Financial S tability Board is actually looking more carefully at that. And we —\nyou know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are. And they ’re actually pretty stably\nfunded, in the sense that there’ s no run risk, but there’ s still macroeconomic risk. And, y ou\nknow, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council , is looking at. And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it ’s\nnot really a financial stability risk , in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial\nsystem to do its job of intermediating credit.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Is there any intention , is there any plan on the part of the Fed or\nother regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for , or—and consistenc y, really —that’s\nthe other point of guidance, right ?—is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the\nsupervisory expectations are for leveraged lending and for all —for anything , for that matter. Is\nanything else coming? Or is it just going to remain kind of , like , bilateral kind of conversations\nwith banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the issue isn’ t that the banks don’ t understand what\nthe rules are. The issue is that the risk isn ’t in the banks. It ’s in—it’s out in those market -based\nvehicles. So I don’ t, I don’t —you know, I no longer am day -to-day involved in this as I was\nbefore I took this job. But my sense is , though, that that’ s really not the problem. I’m not saying\nit’s perfect , but I think we do understand what risks the banks are runnin g. And really the\nquestion is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market -based vehicles that I\nmentioned, and what risks do they present ? And we ’re very carefully assessing that. And we\n\ncontinue to take all these risks seriously. You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few\nweeks ago, so.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I ’m just wondering if you\ncould expand a little bit on the labor market. So the statement noted that the labor market still\nremains strong , but the May jobs report that that we saw missed on estimates , but employment\nrates still stayed at 3.6 percent. I ’m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only\ngot 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report. What does that tell you about\nemployment, and by all standards compared to, say , a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or\nfarther away from full employment or maximum employment?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know , we have to be closer , because more jobs are being created\nthan people a re entering the labor force. The unemployment rate is lower. You know, by just\nlots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place. You mentioned wages . So the\nlevel of wages is very consistent with what it should be , in the sense that it ’s approximately equal\nto inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis. So what ’s, I guess , a little surprising ,\nthough, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late —you know, long into a cycle,\nlet’s say , and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this\nlevel, even though they ’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they ’re not growing\nat a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation.\nSo, you know, we watch —we watch all of this very carefully , and I think we ’re very\ncareful about not assuming that we ’re, you know, that would—that there ’s no more slack in the\nlabor market. You know, we ’ve all lived through —you know, when I got to the Fed, we we re in\nthe 8 percent –plus range , and it ’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’ t seen\nwages picked up. You haven’ t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment. You have\n\nseen a tightening labor market. You know, it —the surveys that I men tioned will all show that\nthe labor market has tightened , but not overtightened.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask—did the FOMC\ndiscuss a change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting , perhaps ending runoffs earlier than\nplanned? And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates\nbefore September?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet. Balance sheet\nrunoff is very close to the end of its planned life. I would say this : If we do provide more\naccommodation —again, we haven’t really addressed this —but if we do provide more\naccommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earl ier this year , which is that we’ll\nalways be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so tha t it serves our dual -mandate objectives.\nThank you very much."
