  "text": "Page \nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Good afternoon. The Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) concluded a two -day meeting earlier today. As you already know from our statement,\nthe Committee decided, starting next month, to modestly reduce the pace at which it is increasing\nthe size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The Committee also clarified its guidance on interest rates, emphasizing that the current near -zero range for the federal funds rat e target likely\nwill remain appropriate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.\nToday’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is\ncontinuing to make progress, but that it also has much farther to travel before conditions can be\njudged normal. Notably, despite significant fiscal headwinds, the economy has been expanding at a moderate pace, and we expect that growth will pick up somewhat in coming quarters, helped by highly accommodative monetary policy and waning fiscal drag. The job market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate having declined further. At the same time, the recover y clearly remains far from complete, with unemployment still elevated and with both\nunderemployment and long -term unemployment still major concerns. We have also seen\nongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely reflect not only longer -term\ninfluences , such as the aging of the population, but also discouragement on the part of potential\nworkers.\nInflation has been running below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent. The\nCommittee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic\n\nPage performance and is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will\nmove back toward its objective over time .\nThis outlook is broadly consistent with individual economic projections submit ted in\nconjunction with this meeting by the 17 FOMC participants —5 Board members and 12 Reserve\nBank presidents. As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own\nview of appropriate monetary policy. FOMC participants generally expect economic growth to\npick up somewhat over the next few years. Their projections for increases in gross domestic product have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to between 2.8 and 3.2 percent for next year, with similar growth estimates for 2015 and 2016. Participants see the unemployment rate, which was 7 percent in November, as continuing to decline. The central tendency of the projections has the unemployment rate falling to between 6.3 and 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 and then to between 5.3 and 5.8 percent by the quarter of 2016.\nMeanwhile, FOMC participants continue to see inflation running below our 2 percent objective\nfor a time but moving gradually back toward 2 percent as the economy expands. The central tendency of their inflation projections for 2013 is 0.9 to 1.0 percent, rising to 1.4 to 1.6 percent for next year and to between 1.7 and 2.0 percent in 2016.\nLet me now return to our decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases. When we began\nthe asset purchase program in September 2012, we said that we would continue purchases until\nthe outlook for the labor market had improved substantially in a context of price stability. Since then, we have seen meaningful cumulative progress in the labor market. For example, since we\nbegan the current purchase program, the economy has added about 2.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a percentage point, to 7 percent. For comparison,\nwhen we started the program, many forecasters saw the unemployment rate remaining near\n\nPage 8 percent throughout 2014. Recent economic indicators have increased our confidence that the\njob market gains will con tinue. For example, nonfarm payrolls have recently been increasing at\na pace of about 200,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage\npoint since June. With fiscal restraint likely diminishing and with signs that household spending is picking up, we expect economic growth to be strong enough to support further job gains. Further, FOMC participants now see the risks around their forecasts of growth and unemployment as having become more nearly balanced, rather than tilted in an unfavorable\ndirection as they were at the inception of the asset purchase program.\nAs you know, we have been purchasing $85 billion per month in longer -term Treasury\nand agency mortgage -backed securities. Starting in January, we will be purchasing $75 billion\nof securities a month, reducing purchases of Treasuries and m ortgage -backed securities by\n$5 billion each. It is important to note though that, even after this reduction, we will be still\nexpanding our holdings of longer -term securities at a ra pid pace. We will also continue to roll\nover maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in to agency mortgage -backed\nsecurities. Our sizable and sti ll-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on\nlonger -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more\naccommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market and help move inflation back toward the Committee’s objective of 2 percent.\nOur modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects the Committee’s belief that\nprogress toward its economic objectives will be sustained. If the incoming data broadly support\nthe Committee ’s outlook for employment and inflation , we will likely reduce the pace of\nsecurities purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. Of course, continued progress\n\nPage is by no means certain . Consequently, future adjustments to the pace of asset purc hases will be\ndeliberate and dependent on incoming information . Asset purchases remain a useful tool that we\nare prepared to deploy as needed to meet our objectives.\nWith unemployment still well above its longer -run normal rate, which Committee\nparticipan ts currently estimate to be between 5.2 and 5.8 percent, and with inflation continuing to\nrun below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term objective, highly accommodative monetary\npolicy remains appropriate. To emphasize its commitment to provide a high le vel of monetary\naccommodation for as long as needed, the FOMC today also enhanced its forward guidance. For\nthe past year, the Committee has said that the current low target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the une mployment rate remained above 6 ½ percent,\ninflation was projected to be no more than half a percentage point above our 2 percent longer -run\ngoal, and longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored. We have emphasized that\nthese numbers are thre sholds, not triggers, meaning that crossing a threshold would not lead\nautomatically to an increase in the federal funds rate but would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase. With many FOMC participants now projecting that the 6 ½ percent unemployment\nthreshold will be reached by the end of 2014, the Committee decided to provide additional information about how it expects its policies to evolve after th e threshold is crossed.\nBased on its assessment of current conditions and the outlook, which is informed by a\nrange of indicators, including measures of labor market conditions, financial conditions, and inflation pressures, the Committee now anticipates it will like ly be appropriate to maintain the\ncurrent federal funds rate target well past the time that the unemployment rate declines to below\n6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below its 2 percent goal. In part ,\n\nPage this expectation reflects our assessment, based on a comprehensive set of indicators, that there\nwill still be a substantial amount of slack in the labor market when the unemployment rate falls\nto 6½ percent. This continuing job market slack imposes heavy costs on the unemployed and the underemployed and their families and reduces our nation’s productive capacity, warranting our ongoing highly accommodative policy. But, as the last phrase of the enhanced guidance underscores, the prospects for inflation provide another reason to keep policy accommodative. The Committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high, and it anticipates keeping rates low at least until it sees inflation clearly moving back toward its 2 percent objective.\nOur forward guidance is reflected in Committee participants’ latest projections for the\npath of the federal funds rate. Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 ½ percent, FOMC participants do not\nexpect a rate increase before 2015. Most see our target for the federal funds rate as rising only modestly in 2015, while 3 do not see an increase until 2016. For all participants, the median\nprojection for the federal funds rate is 75 basis points at the end of 2015 and 1.75 percent at the\nend of 2016.\nIn summary, reflecting cumulative progress and an improved outlook for the job market,\nthe Committee decided today to modestly reduce the monthly pace at which it is adding to the\nlonger -term securities on its balance sheet . If incoming information supports the Committee’s\nexpectation of further progress toward its objectives, the Committee is likely to reduce the pace of monthly purchases in further measured steps in future meetings. However, th e process will be\ndeliberate and data- dependent; asset purchases are not on a preset course. The FOMC also\nprovided additional guidance on future short -term interest rates, stating that it expects to\n\nPage maintain the federal funds target in its current near -zero range well past the time that the\nunemployment rate falls below 6 ½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow 2 percent. The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and i ts\nsubstantial and still- increasing holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary\npolicy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nThank you. I’ll be glad to take your questions.\nYLAN MUI. Thank you . Ylan Mui with the Washington Post . Today was the first\nreduction in asset purchases , and you just said that future reductions will likely occur in\nmeasured steps , but are not on a predetermined course. Can you tell us any more about the\nframework that you all plan to use to determine the size and the timing of t hose reductions ? And\npreviously you had said that you expect the program to end altogether by the middle of next year .\nIs that still a likely scena rio?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as I said, the steps that we take will be dat a-\ndependent. If we ’re making progress in terms of inflation and continue d job gains —and I\nimagine we ’ll continue to do, probably at each meeting , a measured reduction—t hat would take\nus to late in the year , certainly not by the middle of the year. If the economy slows for some\nreason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two. On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we co uld go a bit faster , but my expectation is for\nsimilar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman, CNBC . Mr. Chairman, thank you. When you say\n“similar moderate steps going forward, ” is $10 billion an increment that people should\nanticipate ? And is equal amounts of mortgage -back ed securities and T reasuries also what one\n\nPage should anticipate? Finally, when you say “ well pas t” the unemployment rate of 6½ percent, why\nnot pick a number ? Why say “well pas t”? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Sure . On the first issue of $10 billion, again, we say we are\ngoing to take further modest steps subsequently , so that would be the general range . But again, I\nwant to emphasi ze that we are going to be data- depen dent. We could s top purchases if the\neconomy disappoints . We could pick them up somewhat if the economy is st ronger .1\nIn terms of MBS versus T reasuries, we discussed that issue. I think that the general sense\nof the C ommittee was that equal reductions , or approximately equal reductions , was the simpler\nway to do this . It obviously doesn’ t make a great deal of difference in the end to how much we\nhold. So that was going to be our strategy .\nOn the issue of another number, the unemployment rate —let ’s talk first about the labor\nmarket condition. The unemployment rate is a good indicator of the labor market . It’s probably\nthe best single indicator that we have . And so we were comfortable setting a 6.5 percent\nunemployment rate as the point at which we would begin to look at a more broad set of labor\nmarket indicators . However, precisely because we don’ t want to look just at the unemployment\nrate, we want to —once we get to 6½—we want to look at hiring, quits, vacancies, participation,\nlong-term unemployment, et cetera, wages . We couldn ’t put it in terms of another\nunemployment rate level , specifically . So, I expect there w ill be some time pas t the 6½ percent\nbefore all of the other variables that we’ll be looking at will line up in a way that will give us\nconfidence that the labor market is strong enough to withstand the beginning of increases in\nrates .\n\n1 The Chairman meant to say: “We could stop the reductions in the pace of purchases if the economy\ndisappoints. We could reduce the pace of purchases somewhat more quickly if the economy is stronger.”\n\nPage The SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections , which were distributed, obviously that ’s\nindividual assessments and not the C ommittee ’s collective view . But nevertheless, it gives you\nsome sense of current expectations about the length of time . The SEP shows that the 6.5 percent\nis expected by a large number of people to be reached about at the end of next year, end of 2014.\nAnd then the first rate increases , according t o the so- called dots c hart, take place near the end of\n2015. So that ’s the order of the magnitude , I think , that people are currently expecting , but again\nI emphasize that it will depend on our being persuaded that —over , across a broad range of\nindicators —the labor market is sufficiently strong that we could begin to withdraw\naccommodation.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, as\nyou we ll know, the F ed is going through a transition next month. Can you talk about the role\nthat Janet Yellen played in formulating the policy that’ s being laid out today , and what kind of\nconsistency the public can expect as we go into her tenure , assuming she ’s confirmed , with the\nprogram that you’ re laying out today ? W ill it carry on under her leadership?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yes, it will. I have always consulted closely with Janet,\neven well before she was named by the P resident , and I consulted closely with her on these\ndecisions as well . And she fully supports what we did today.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, your\ninflation forecasts never get back to 2 percent in the time horizon that you cover here , out to\n2016. Given t hat, why should we believe the F ed has a symmetric inflation target ? And, in\nparticular, why should we believe you’ re following an optimal policy —optimal control policy , as\nyou’ve said in the past —given that that would imply inflation going a bit above target at some\npoint ? Thank you.\n\nPage CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , again, these are individual estimates, there are big\nstandard errors implicitly around them and so on. We do think that inflation will grad ually move\nback to 2 percent , and we allow for the possibility , as you know , in our guidance that it could go\nas high as 2½ percent . Even though inflation has been quite low in 2013, let me give you the\ncase for why inflation might rise .\nFirst, there ar e some special factors , such as health -care costs and some other things , that\nhave been unusually low and might be reversed. Secondly, if you look at the fundamentals for\ninflation , incl uding inflation expectations , whether measured by financial markets o r surveys ; if\nyou look at growth, which we now anticipate w ill be picking up bot h in the U .S. and\ninternationally; if you look at wages , which have been growing at 2 percent and a little bit higher\naccording to many indicators —all of these things suggest that inflation will gradually pick up.\nBut what I tried to emphasize in my opening remarks , and which is clear in our statement , is that\nwe take this very seriously . It’s not easy to —inflation cannot be picked up and move d where\nyou want it . It takes —it requires , obviously , some luck and some good policy . But we are very\ncommitted to making sure that inflation does not stay too low , and we are continuing to monitor\nthat very carefully and to take whatever actions necessary to achieve that.\nROBIN HARDING. And on optimal control ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for\ninflation —inflation is quite —can be quite inertial . It can take quite a time to move . And the\nresponsi veness of inflation to increasing economic activity is quite low . So—and particularly\ngiven an environment where we have falling oil prices and other factors that are contributing\ndownward forces on inflation, i t’s difficult to get inflation to move quickly to target . But we are,\n\nPage again , committed to doing what’ s necessary to get inflation back to target over the next couple of\nyears.\nCRAIG TORRES . Craig Torres from Bloomberg News . There ’s been a great deal of\ndiscussion in your profession about the potency of policy at the zero boundary . And to kind of\nbounce off Robin, it ’s very striking that inflation has fallen while QE3 has been in place , and the\neconomy continues to undershoot the FOMC ’s forecast . So, I guess the simple question is, are\nyou giving up? Y ou know, I mean, have you reached the limit of your policy tools , and is there\nnothing more you can do ? The economy is still running way below the trend line that existed\nbefore the financial crisis.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, everything depends on what benchmark you compare\nit to, as you know . I said last year that monetary policy was not a panacea . It couldn ’t solve all\nour problems . And , in particular, it can ’t do anything about a slowing in potential growth, which\nappears to have happen ed, at least to some extent . It can ’t do much or anything about fiscal\npolicy , which is working in quite the opposite direction. So, given those things, I think the\noutcomes we ’ve had are perhaps not as bad as you would—might think . In particular, as I ’ve\nmentioned many times, the Congressional Budget Office assessed the fiscal drag in 2013 as\nbeing about 1½ percentage points of growth. We ’re looking like we ’re going to get in the low 2s\nactual growth . Add those numbers t ogether, it ’s kind of a counter factual . It says th at monetary\npolicy a ppears to have succeeded in off setting a good bi t of that fiscal drag , which we were not\nat all sure that we could accomplish . So, we ’re certainly not giving up. We intend to maintain a\nhighly accommodative policy . Nothing tha t we did today was intended to reduce\naccommodation . We ’re still going to be buying assets at a high rate and increasing and\nholding —increasing our balance sheet and holding on to those assets . In our guidance today —\n\nPage we strengthen ed our guidance to make clear that we expect to keep rates low well beyond the\npoint that unemployment hits 6½ percent.\nPETER BARNES . Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir . Was it a close call in the discussion\ntoday among participants and members of —given all you’ ve said about the outlook and your\nforecast, was there a lot a of debate on whether or not to go ahead and start tapering now or wait\nlonger —wait for more data?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , certainly, it ’s a very —it was a very important\ndecision , and we debated it quite extensively . That being said, the question we asked ourselves\nwas, did we feel comfortable that —to say that we had met , or were at least well on the way\ntoward s meeting , the criterion we set when we began the program in September of 2012? And\nthat criterion , of course , was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market . And\nif you look at the cumulative improvement —and I mentioned some figures in my opening\nremarks —or if you look at recent numbers , either on employ ment, unemployment. And also in\nterms of growth, we ’re seeing encouraging numbers in terms of household spending , for\nexample, auto purchases, fiscal drag is reduced, stronger numbers internationally . Now, I don’ t\nwant to overstate the case. As you look at our projections, you’ ll see we only assume or project\na small pickup in growth going into next year . But there was a pretty widespread view that there\nwas a reasonable expectation , first , that the recent gains in the labor market would continue —\nand, remember, we ’re just beginning this process now, so by the time we complete this process, I\nthink it ’s very likely that we ’ll easily pass the hurdle of a substantial improvement in the outlook\nfor the labor market . Now, it is true that while we have pass ed the—or , made significant\nprogress on the labor market and growth hurdles, there is still this question about inflation, which is a bit of a concern —more than a bit of concern, as we indicated in our statement . Our outlook\n\nPage is still for inflation to go b ack to 2 percent . I gave you some reasons why I think that will\nhappen. But we take that very seriously , and if inflation does not show signs of returning to\ntarget, we will take appropriate action.\nREBECCA JARVIS . Hi, there. Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News . Mr. Chairman, now that\nyou have introduced tapering into the system, if the economy were to stumble again in the future,\nwould you recommend, or have you discussed with your colleagues , increasing bond buying in\nthe future ? And have you considered any alternative measures —for example, more direct\nstimulus directly into the economy if it were to stumble again?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . What kind of direct stimulus do you have in mind?\nREBECCA JARVIS . Well, any type of stimulus that you would not be essentiall y\nbuying it back from the banks.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, in terms of the legal authorities that the Federal\nReserve has, we don ’t have some of the —\nREBECCA JARVIS . If you could ask for it.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . If we could ask for it . Well, we ’re getting now to a fanciful\ndiscussion, I think. I think our basic tools are asset purchases , and we are allowed only to buy\nTreasuries and agency securities . We are not allowed to buy corporates or other things , the way\nmany central banks are. We have—with interest rates near zero, we can manage our forward\nguidance, and I think that has been helpful, that ’s been effective. We probably could do more\nwith that. But there are limits to that as well because , beyond a certain point, markets may not\naccept —you know, may not view the long -distance , way -ahead guidance as being credible. We\ncan change the interest rate we pay on r eserves , which is something we ’ve talked about .\n\nPage The other kind of thing that —the only other thing I can think of that amounts to a dir ect\ninfusion into the economy , if you will, is action similar to the British F unding for Lending\nprogram , where they provided cheap funding to banks if the banks could show that they had\nincreased their lending to households or small businesses . We could, in principle , do something\nlike that, and we ’ve looked at that because we do have a discount window where we lend to\nbanks . However , somewhat differently from what was going on in the U .K. and in Europe , here,\nour banks are fl ush with liquidity, they have plenty of cash on hand—they ow n lots of reserves ,\nof course . And so our sense was that the re just wouldn’ t be any take up on that program , at least\nunder current conditions . We do not have the authority to lend directly to small businesses or\nother typ es of institutions . And in any case, I don’ t think right now that tight credit, in most\nareas , is the major problem. I think what we have , in many cases , is that firms are either not\nlooking for credit or their balance sheets are not strong enough that they pass creditworthy\nscreen ings at the bank . So we do have a range of things that we can do, but we are already\nbeing, I think, pretty aggressive.\nREBECC A JARVIS . And w ould you increase the bond purchases?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Under some circumstances, yes.\nGREG IP . Greg Ip of t he Economist . I have a narrow question and a related broader\nquestion. The narrow question is, did the changeover in leadership play any role in the decision\non when to begin tapering, i.e., at this meeting ? For example, did you have a preference, all else\nequal , to get it started before you left ? The related broader question is , you are a historian of\nmonetary policy . What do you think future historians of monetary policy will have to say about\nyour eight years at the Federal Reserve helm?\n\nPage CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . The answer t o the first question is “ no.” The answer t o the\nsecond question is “ I’ll be interested to see .” I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks .\nThe—what we’ ve showed—there’ ve been two big changes , at least —more than two, but two\nthat I would cite at the Fed in the last few years, of course, the result , in many ways , of the crisis .\nThe first is that the Fed eral Reserve has rediscovered its roots , in the sense that the F ed was\ncreated to stabilize the financial system in times of panic . And we did that , and we used tools\nthat we re analogous in spirit to what central banks have done for many hundreds of years , but, of\ncourse, adapted to a modern financial system.\nThe other thing that was unique about —maybe not completely unique, but largely unique\nabout this period was that we were trying to help the economy recover from a deep recession at a\ntime when interes t rates were almost , or essentially , zero . And that required us to use other\nmethods —most prominently , forward guidance and asset purchases , neither of which is entirely\nnew. But , clearly , this is —unless you put aside the D epression , where monetary policy was , on\nthe whole , pretty passive —this is the first—one of the first examples , at least , of aggressive\nmonetary policy taking place in a near -zero interest rate environment . Now we ’re seeing , of\ncourse , Japan and the U.K. and other countries also taking similar types of approaches . And I\nthink that will be an issue —an area that monetary historians will be interested in exploring , as\nwell as monetary theorists and empirical studies.\nJASON LANGE . Jason Lange with Reuters . Chairman B ernanke, today , with one hand,\nyou’re giving the economy something by telling us that or signaling that you may keep interest\nrates lower for longer than we previously thought . But with the other hand, you’re taking\nsomet hing away by reducing the large -scale asset purchases . If you think that , overall, this is\nmaintaining the level of monetary accommodation steady, is that a sign that the decision to\n\nPage reduce the asset purchases is relatively less about an improved outlook for the economy and\nperhaps more about the concern that the asset purchases are less effective or might be f ueling\nbubbles ? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as I said before, asset purchases are a supplementary\ntool. Our main tool is interest rate policy . The reason that asset pur chases are a supplementary\ntool is because it ’s a much less familiar tool. We have less ability to calibrate how big the effects\nare, for example. And it ’s also true that , as the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve gets large,\nmanaging that balance sheet, exiting from that balance sheet become more difficult . And there\nare concerns about effects on asset prices, although, I would have to say that ’s another thing that\nfuture monetary economist s will want to be looking at very carefully . So, our view was —in\nSeptember 2012—was that we had interest rates already low, and they were expected to stay low for a good long time . The economy, though, was faltering . We needed an additional boost . And\nso we brought in the asset purchase program again . We put in a specific objective, which is\nsubstantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market . Our sense was once that\nintermediate objective was attained —that is, when the economy had grown and was moving\nforward —that , at that point , we could begin to wind down the secondary tool, the supplementary\ntool, and achieve essentially the same amount of accommodation using interest rates and for ward\nguidance.\nAnd so, I do want to reiterate that this is not intended to be a tightening . We don’ t think\nthat there ’s an inflation problem or anything like that. On the one hand, asset purchases are still\ngoing to be continuing , we’re still going to be building our bal ance sheet . The total amount of\nassets that we acquire are probably more than was—certainly more than what was expected in\nSeptember 2012 or in June 2013. So we ’ll have a very substantial balance sheet , which we ’ll\n\nPage continue to hold. And now we ’ve also clarified our guidance that we will be keeping rates low\nwell pas t unemployment of 6.5 percent . So we ’re trying here to get a high level of\naccommodation . It is true that the purchases are —we view as supplementary to the interest rate\npolicy . But, again, the action today is intended to keep the level of accommodation more or less\nthe same overall and eno ugh to push the economy forward.\nVICTORIA MCGRANE . Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones . In an earlier response, you\nsort of laid out the argument against —or sort of explain ed why the C ommittee didn ’t lower the\n6.5 percent unemployment threshold. Is that convers ation over ? Have you all put off the table\nchanging those thresholds ? Has there been any other further discussion on perhaps adding a\nlower bound to the inflation target as well ? And then, specifically on inflation, w hat tools or\nactions could the C ommittee take if inflation continues to run below your target or even falls\nfurther?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think we want to make an assessment now . I\nwouldn’ t expect any changes in the very near term . We want to see how much accommodation\nwe have and w hether it ’s sufficient , whether the economy is continuing to grow, a nd inflation is\nmoving back toward target , as we anticipate. But there are things we can do . We can strengthen\nthe guidance in various ways . And while the view of the C ommittee was that the best way\nforward today was in this more qualitative approach, which incorporates elements both of the\nunemployment th reshold and the inflation floor, t hat further strengthening would be possible ,\nand it ’s something that has certainly not been ruled out . And , of course, asset purchases are still\nthere to be used . We do have tools to manage a large balance sheet . We ’ve made a lot of\nprogress on that . So while , again, while we think that we can provide a high level of\naccommodation with a somewhat slo wer pace—but still very high pace —of asset purchases and\n\nPage our interest rate policy , we do have other things we can do if we need to ramp up again. That\nbeing said, we ’re hopeful that the economy will c ontinue to make progress , and that we ’ll begin\nto see the whites of the eyes of the end of the recovery and the beginning of the more normal\nperiod of economic growth.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM . Some members of your staff published a paper earlier this\nfall arguing that in times of high unemployment— and, particularly , when some of that\nunemployment is calcifying into disengagement —there’ s an argument for monetary policy to be\neven more aggressive . And yet you are now announcing that you’ ll do less rather than more .\nThe Fed has done that twice before and both times has regretted the decision. Ca n you talk about\nwhy you are not erring on the side of doing more?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, again , we’re not doing less . We ’ll see how\naccommodation shapes up . But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit, again , we expect the\ntotal balance sheet to be quite large and maintained for —at a large level for a long time . And we\nexpect to keep rates low for a very long time. We ’re providing a great deal of accommodation to\nthe economy . I agree with your observation, and the observation of the paper that you cited, that\nthere is a case for being particularly aggressive, and I think we ha ve been aggressive to try to\nkeep the economy growing , and we are seeing progress in the labor market . So I would disput e\nthe idea that we ’re not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy.\nWYATT ANDREW S. Mr. Chairman , thank you . Wyatt Andrews at CBS . Given the\nbillions of dollars that the Fed has put into the economy over the years, do you see a leading reason why t he economy has not created more jobs?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So, we’ve been in a —it’ s been about a little over four years\nnow since the recovery began, four and a half years . It’s been a slow recovery . There are a\n\nPage number of reasons for that . It’s—of course , that ’s something for econometricians and historians\nto grapple with, but there have been a number of factors which have contributed to slower\ngrowth . They include, for example, the observation that financial cris es tend to disrupt the\neconomy, may a ffect innovation, new products, new f irms. We had a big housing bust, a nd so,\nthe construction sector, of course, has been quite depressed for a while . We ’ve had continuing\nfinancial disturbances in Europe and elsewhere . We’ve had very tight , on the whole —except for\nin 2009—we had very tight fiscal policy . People don’ t appreciate how tight fiscal policy has\nbeen . At this stage in the last recession , which wa s a much milder recession, state, local, and\nfederal governments had hired 400,000 additional workers from the trough of the recession. At the same point in this recovery , the change in state, local, and federal government workers is\nminus 600,000. So there ’s about a million workers difference in how many people are —have\nbeen employed at all levels of government . So, fiscal policy has been tight , contractiona ry, so\nthere have been a lot of head winds. All that being said, we have been disappointed in the pace of\ngrowth , and we don ’t fully understand why . Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying\npotential, at least temporarily . Producti vity has been disappointing . It may be that there ’s been\nsome bad luck—for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like . But compared to\nother advanced industrial countries —Europe, the U.K., Japan —compared to other countries and\nadvanced industrial countries reco vering from financial crise s, the U.S. recovery has actually\nbeen better than most . It’s not been good, i t’s not been satisfactory . Obviously, we still have a\nlabor market where it ’s not easy for people to find work. A lot of young people can’ t get the\nexperience and entr ée into the labor market . But, I think, given all of the things that we faced ,\nit’s perhaps , at least in retrospect, not shocking that the recovery has been somewhat tepid.\n\nPage GREG ROBB . Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch.com . You just talked a little\nbit about fiscal policy and now Congress has —is set to pass a budget deal , and they haven ’t\nreally done much to reduce the deficit . And it looks like they ’re not going to do anything until\nafter the next presidential election . So, could you talk a little bit about that ? You’ve been\npressing for a bigger deal and reducing the U.S. debt burden. Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as always, of course, I don ’t address specific fiscal\nactions . I will say a couple of things about this deal . One is that , relative to where we were in\nSeptember and October, it certainly is nice that there’ s been a bipartisan deal , and that it looks\nlike it’ s going to pass both hous es of Congress . It’s also, at least directionally, what I have\nrecommended in testimony , which is that it eases a bit the fiscal restra int in the next couple of\nyears, a period where the economy needs help to finish the recovery . And, in place of that , it\nachieves savings further out in the 10- year window . So those things are po sitive things . Of\ncourse, there’ s a lot more work to be done , I have no doubt about that . But it’s certainly a better\nsituation than we had in September and October , or in Janua ry during the fiscal cliff , for that\nmatter . And I think it will be good for confidence if fiscal policy and c ongressional leaders work\ntogether to —even if there’ s—even if the outcomes are small , as this one was, it’ s a good thing\nthat they are working cooperatively and making some progress.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman Bernanke, Donna Borak with American Banker . As you\nlook back on the regulatory reform effort over the last several years —the rules that have been\ncompleted , those that have yet to be finalized —what rules would you have like d to have seen\ntougher ? And one s that, perhaps , you would have liked to have seen finished before you leave?\nAnd as someone that ha s been a steward of the financial crisis and the reform effort, as you leave\nnow, do you fee l that the safeguards are now in place , that the system is safer?\n\nPage CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yes , the system is certainly safer , and one indication of that\nis the amount of capital that large banks hold. So, for example, on the capital side, we have\nimposed Basel III requirements, much tougher requirements , as you know, for the large banks ,\nwith surcharges that will be part of that process . We’ve imposed— I think one of the main\ninnovations , which I am very pleased with , is the use of stress testing , trying to see whether\nbanks have enough capital not only to deal with normal fluctuations, but to deal with the very\nsevere combination of a sharp downturn in the economy and very bad fi nancial conditions . And\nI think that has been a very important test, both of banks ’ abilities to survive a bad situation but\nalso their abilities to measure their risk s, which was something that was very deficient going into\nthe crisis . Beyond that, we ’re looking at a leverage ratio, of course, that we expect to complete\nfairly so on, the possibility of having debt required at the holding company to assist in a\nresolution, we ’re looking a t capital for —to backstop firms that rely heavily on short -term\nwholesale funding . So there’s a much stronger capital -oriented drive at this point to strengthen\nour financial system —and th at’s just one dimension. A nd then there’s liquidity and many other\naspects . I think, you know, it ’s not really up to me to say whether these things are tough enough\nor not . I mean , you and other observers who are writing about this and thinking about this\nobviously will have your opinions . But, I guess, what I would say about that is that we ’re not\ndone . We have still some important rules to complete, although all of them are well advanced .\nAnd as we get the se rules done and implement them , I’m sure they ’ll make a very substantial\ndifference in the safety of the system , but whether more needs to be done —I’ll leave that as an\nopen question, and I think we ’ll be working on this for some time.\nPETER COOK . Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television. Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank\nyou for holding these news conferences . I hope you encourage your successor to have even\n\nPage more of them . One thing I know you’ re going to miss is traveling to Capitol Hill to testify , and\none thing that ’s going to be happening next year , according to the chairman of the House\nFinancial Services Committee , is a full review of the Federal Reserve— even the Federal Reserve\nAct, the structure of the Fed, the mission of the Fed, and the mandate of the Fed . And I wanted\nto see if you might be willing to impart some words of wisdom to members of Congress as\nthey consider possible legislative changes . What , if anything , could they do to the structure of\nthe Federal Reserve, the mandate of the F ederal Reserve—the dual mandate—that might help\nFed policy makers in the future ? Do you think the dual mandate still is merited ? And just a \nquestion for you, sir , as you get set to leave and perhaps your last news conference here —you\ntalked a little bit about your frustrations, the headwinds that you face d through the course of your\neight years . Is there a decision —with the benefit of hindsight —that you would do differently,\none change perhaps in a decision making process that you’ ve made, your fell ow colleagues have\nmade here, that you think would have made a difference mater ially over the last eight years?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, on the centennial review, let me just say , first, that\none of the things that I ’m proud of , and I ’ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years , is to\nincrease the transparency of the Fed and to increase the accountability of the Fed . You\nmentioned those trips to Capitol Hill. I ’ve testified many times , as have a number of my\ncolleagues .\nThere is this notion that the Fed is not audited or i t has all kinds of secret books —all\nthese things . As you well know, we have complete openness to the General Accountability\nOffice, the GAO —Government Accountability Office . We have an IG, Inspector Ge neral , of\nour own. We have a private accounting firm that does all the books as well under very tough\nstandards . We publish regular reports on all aspects of our operations . So we ’re very open , and\n\nPage we are by all means willing to work with Congress to se e if there ’s anything that they think\nmight be done better or in a more effective way . So, we’re open to doing that .\nI hope that those reviewing the central b ank will, of course, recognize that central\nbanking is an old activity . The 17th century is when the Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of\nEngland began operation, so we know a lot about central banking . There are a lot of experts on\ncentral banking, a lot of experts on monetary policy . Every major country has a central bank . So\nwe’re not starting from scratch . I mean , there are a lot of people with a lot of expertise on this ,\nand I hope that , as we talk about these issues , that we are bringing in serious people who\nunderstand these issues and who can make good suggestions .\nNow, there are a range of different mandates around the world . There are some single\nmandates , there are some dual mandates, et cetera. It’s our sense that the dual mandate has\nserved us well here—in particular , that the Fed has been able, at times , to spe ed the recovery\nfrom recession and help put people back to work more quickly . Of course, we can ’t do anything\nabout long -run employment opportunities , but we can help the economy recover more quickly .\nSo I think that that ’s valuable. I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn ’t\nreally matter whether we have one mandate or two , because we’ re below our inflation target and\nwe—unemployment is above where we ’d like it to be . So both sides of our mandate are pointing\nexactly in the same direction , which is to provide strong accommodation to the economy to help\nit recover .\nLooking in retrospect , I—you know, that ’s a very hard question. Every decision you\nmake, of course , is done in real time , with deficient information and whatever you know at the\ntime and whatever the experts are telling you about any particular issue. Obviously, we were\nslow to recognize the crisis . I was slow to recognize the crisis . In retrospect, it was a traditional\n\nPage classic crisis, but in a very, very different guise: different types of financial instruments,\ndifferent types o f institutions, which made it , for a historian like me , more difficult to see .\nWhether or not we could have prevented or done more about it, that ’s another question. You\nknow, by the time I became C hairman , it was already 2006 , and house prices were already\ndeclining . Most of the mortgages had been made, but , obviously, it would have been good to\nhave recognized that earlier and try to take more preventive action . That being said, we ’ve done\neverything we can think of , essentially , to strengthen the Fed ’s ability to monitor the financial\nmarkets, to take actions to stabilize the econ omy and the financial system . So, I think, going\nforward, we ’re much better prepared for —to deal with these kinds of events than we were when\nI became C hairman in 2006.\nKEVIN HALL . Thank you, Mr. Chairman . Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers . I\nwant to indulge in a local question and a broader question. A s the paper that owns the South\nCarolina papers , I think there ’s a lot of interest as to whether you’ re going to retire to Dillon,\nSouth Carolina , and write your kiss -and-tell book. B ut do you envision any role for yourself in\nSouth Carolina , post -chairmanship? And then the broader question— your pred ecessor, Dr.\nGreenspan, in his new book ar gues that long -term investment—one of the reasons we may be\nseeing such a slow economy is that people are afraid debt and deficits are reducing long -term\ninvestment . People are —companies are investing in the sorts of things that make them leaner,\nget by with fewer people , but the kind of expansion, we ’re not seeing . Do you feel that debt and\ndeficits are weighing down these sorts of long -term decisionmaking , and does it argue for m ore\ndrastic action on the short -term?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Let me ask you, do you own the Charlotte Observer ?\nKEVIN HALL . Yes.\n\nPage CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Ah . So, most of my family now is in North Carolina , and\nI’ve got a number of family members in Charlotte and also in Durham . So my wife and I are\ngoing to spend the Christmas vacation in North Carolina . I still have —my uncle still lives in\nDillon . He ’s 85, and very, very, very chipper .\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER. [Inaudible remark ]\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. O kay, good.\nBut I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe , will stay in Washington for\na bit of time .\nAbout investment, I think there are a lot of reasons why investment is weaker than we\nwould like . I think the first and most important reason is , the recovery is slow . I mean,\ninvestment is driven by sales, by the need for capac ity. And, you know, with a slow -growing\nGDP, slow- growing economy , most firms do not yet feel that much pressure on their capac ity to\ndo major, new projects . There’ s also a var iety of uncertainties out there —fis cal, regulatory, tax ,\nand so on—that no doubt affect some of these calculations . We hear that from our FOMC\nparticipants around the table as they report from their local D istricts . So I think there are a lot of\nfactors.\nUsually, you think that the way that a deficit or a long -term debt would affect investment\nwould be through what ’s called “crowding out ”—that is, raising interest rates . But high interest\nrates —we may have many problems , but high interest rat es is not our problem right now .\nThere’ s plenty of —particularly for larger firms —there’ s plenty of credit available at low interest\nrates . And we intend, of course, to try to continue to provide that to help the economy grow and\nto stimulate investment spending . But I think that it’s going to take faster overall growth to get\nfirms trying to expand capacity , and I think if we —if consumer spending increases , as we think it\n\nPage will, and if exports increase, as they seem to be doing, then we ’ll probably see greater investment\nas well.\nSTEVE BECKNER . Steve Beckner of MNI . Mr. Chairman, it ’s been a pleasure\ncovering you. One of the factors that your policy statement says will be considered in assessing\nthe future pace of asset purchases is the cost and efficacy of those purchases . To what extent has\nthe—or y ou might say , cost and benefits —to what extent has t hat calculation already changed ?\nTo what extent did that affect today ’s decision ? And, going forward , looking on the cost side,\nsomebody else mentioned bubbles . Not just bubbles , but to what extent will, you know, the\nwhole consideration of threats to financial stability come into play , as well as the potential for\nlosses on the Fed’ s own portfolio ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So I will answer your question, and I’ll try and help maybe\ndo a better job on Binya ’s question as well . We do think, again , of the asset purchases as a\nsecondary tool behind interest rate policy , and we do think that the cost –benefit ratio , particularly\nas the assets on the balance sheet get large, that it moves in a way that’ s less favorable. The\ncosts involved include, you know, managing the exi t from that. The possible —it’ s very unlikely\nthat the Fed will have losses in any comprehensive sense. We ’ve already put $350 billion of\nprofits back to the T reasury since 2009, which is about as much as we delivered to the T reasury\nbetween 1990 and 2007 combined. So, over any period of time, clearly , the Fed is actually\nmaking a good bit of money for the taxpayer and for the government . But it could be that if\ninterest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the T reasury for a couple of years , and that would create problems , no doubt , for the Fed in\nterms of c ongressional response .\n\nPage There are issues of how well we understand and can manage the effects of asset\npurchases . I think, for example, that an important difference between asset purchases and\ninterest rate policy is that asset purchases work by affecting what is called the “term premium,”\nwhic h is essentially the additional part of the interest rate which investors require as\ncompensation for holding longer -term securities . We just don’ t understand very well —and when\nI say “ we,” I mean the economic s profession—don’ t understand very well what m oves t he term\npremium . And so, we sa w last summer —we saw a very big jump in the term premium that was\nvery destabilizing and created a lot of stress in financial markets . So there are a number of\nreasons why asset purchases, while effective, while I thin k they have been important, are less\nattractive tools than traditional interest rate policy , and that ’s the reason why we have relied\nprimarily on interest rates , but used asset purchases as a supplement when we’ ve needed it to\nkeep forward progress .\nI think that, you know, obviously there are some financial stability issues involved there .\nWe look at the possibility that asset purchases have led to bubbly pricing in certain markets or in\nexcessive leverage or excessive risk -taking . We don’ t think t hat that ’s happened to an extent\nwhich is a danger to the system , except other than that when those positions unwind, like we saw\nover the summer, they can create some bumpiness in interest rate markets , in particular . Our\ngeneral philosophy on financial s tability issues is , where we can, that we try to address it first\nand foremost by making sure that the banking system and the financial s ystem are as strong as\npossible —if banks have a lot of capital , they can withstand losses , for example—a nd by using\nwhatev er other tools we have to try to avoid bubbles or other kinds of financial risks . That being\nsaid, I don ’t think that you can completely ignore financial stability concerns in monetary policy\nbecause we can ’t control them perfectly , and there may be situa tions when financial instability\n\nPage has implications for our mandate, which is jobs and inflation, which we saw , of co urse, in the\nGreat Recession . So it’s a very complex issue.\nI think it will be many years before central banks have completely worked out exactly\nhow best to deal with financial instability questions . Certainly, the first line of defense for us is\nregulatory and other types of measures , but we do have to pay some attention to that . I would\nsay at this point , though, that the asset purchases program —the last one —is well on its way to\nmeeting our economic objective , and I am very pleased that we ’re able to , over time , wind down\nthis program, slowing the pace of purchases on current plans , because we reached our objecti ve\nrather than because the costs or efficacy issues became important . So I think that , in this case ,\nthat that ’s not a concern at this juncture with respect to this program.\nANNALYN KURTZ . Annalyn Kurtz with CNN . I recall in Jackson Hole last year, you\ncited a study that said the first $2 trillion in asset purchases had boost ed GDP by about 3 percent\nand increased private -sector employment by 2 million jobs . Now your balance sheet is nearin g\n$4 trillion, and I ’m wondering , do you feel the third round of asset purchases pack ed as much\nbang for your buck? And do you still think the first study offered a reasonable estimate?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, it’ s very hard to know —in terms of the study, it ’s\nvery hard to know . It’s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects . You have to\nobviously ask yourself, you know, what would have happen ed in the absence of the policy ? I\nthink that study —I think it was a very interesting study , but it was on the upper end of the\nestimates that people have gotten i n a variety of studies looking at the effects of asset purchases .\nThat being said, I ’m pretty comfortable with the idea that this prog ram did , in fact , create jobs . I\ncited some figures . To repeat one of them, t he Blue Chip forecast s for unemployment in this\ncurrent quarter —made before we beg an our program —were on the order 7.8 percent , and that\n\nPage was before th e fiscal cliff deal, which even —created even more fiscal headwinds for the\neconomy . And , of course, we ’re now at 7 percent . I’m not saying that the asset purchases made\nall that difference, but it made some of the difference , and I think it has helped create jobs .\nAnd you can see how it works . I mean , the asset purchases brought down long -term\ninterest rates, brought down mortgage rates, brought down corporate bond yields , brought down\ncar loan interest rates, and we’ ve seen the response in those areas as the economy has done\nbetter . Moreover , again, this has been done in the face of very tight, unusually tight fiscal policy\nfor a recovery period. So I do think it ’s been effective, but the precise size of the impact is\nsomething I think that we can very reasonably disagree about , and that work will co ntinue on.\nAs I said before, the uncertainty about the impact and the uncertainty about the effects of ending\nprograms and so on is one of the reasons why we have treated this as a supplementary tool rather than as our primary tool.\nDON LEE . Don Lee, L.A. Times . Unemployment benefits , as you know , are expiring\nshortly for more than a million people , and many more people will see their benefits e nd next\nyear. How much of an economic impact do you see that ha ving? And , secondly, what effect\nwould you exp ect that will have on the unemployment rate ? Could it —if those people drop out\nof the labor force, then could that knock the employment rate down quite a bit?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yes . Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those\ndirectly affected, you know, who a re receiving benefits , and we do have an unusually large\nnumber of long -term unemployed people in the United States now, which is obviously a major\nconcern and one that I c ited in my opening remarks . The effects of ending extended\nunemployment benefits , quantitatively , for the economy overall , are probably not very large\nbecause they work in two directions . On the one hand, by putting the benefits into the system,\n\nPage you are providing additiona l income . That income is spent . People receiving unemployment\nbenefits obviously tend to spend a very high fraction of their income . That is a positive fo r\ngrowth . On the other side, it —probably some folks who are— can no longer qualify for\nunemployment benefits will just drop out of the labor force, and that will bring the\nunemployment rate down , but, for some sense , the wrong reason. So, overall , it will have —it\ncould have a very small effect on the measured unemployment rate. But, again , I think that issue\nneeds to be discussed more in ter ms of the impact on those most directly affected rather than on\nthe overall economy.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Hi . Kate Davidson from Politico . This is a bit of a follow -up to an\nearlier q uestion . You talked about this centennial review of the Fed that the House is\nundertaking . And the Fed, of course , has been under a lot of scrutiny , and you spoke recently\nabout the importance of the Fed sta nding up to political pressure . So I just wondere d what\nadvice you have , or what advice you’ve already given , to Janet Yellen when it comes to dealing\nwith Congress .\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Excellent question. Well, I think the first thing to agree to\nis that Congress is our boss . The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the\ngovernme nt. It’s important that we maintain our policy independence in order to be able to make\ndecisions without short -term political interference . At the same time, it’ s up to the Congress to\nset our structure , to set our mandate , and that ’s entirely legitimate , and we need to go and explain\nourselves . We need to explain why certain approaches are not so good or might be better . But,\nobviously, they represent the public , and they certainly have every right to set the terms on which\nthe Federal Reserve operates and so on.\n\nPage That being said, I think that we are , in fact , an effective central bank , that we are near the\nfrontier in terms of transparency, in terms of the effectiveness of our policies . We ’re highly\nrespected among central bankers and other p olicymakers around the world. And so, I hope that\nwhen they do review the Fed, if that ’s what they do, again, that they rely on expertise and highly\nqualified individuals who know the ins and outs of central banking and monetary policy, which\nare not simp le matters . And it would be very interesting to have a thorough discussion of many\nof the issues involved that the Fed has been engaged in . But , again, I hope it will be on a high\nlevel that uses the best and most qualified people debating, you know, wha t changes , if any , are\nneeded and —or, you know, what ’s being done right.\nMURREY JACOBSON. Hi . Murre y Jacobson with t he NewsHour . On t he question of\nlonger -term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation, how much do you see that\nas the result of structural changes going on in the economy at this point ? And to what extent do\nyou think government can help alleviate that in this environment?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . I think a lot of the declines in the participation rate are , in\nfact, demograph ic or structural , reflecting sociological trends . Many of the changes that we’ re\nseeing now, we were also seeing to some degree even before the crisis, and we have a number of staffers here at the Fed who have studied parti cipation rates and the like . So I think a lot of the\nunemployment decline that we ’ve seen , contrary to sometimes what you hear, I think a lot of it\nreally does come from jobs as opposed to declining participation.\nThat being said, there certainly is a portion of the decline in participation , which is\nrelated to people dropping out of the labor force because they are discouraged, because their skills have become obsolete, because they ’ve lost attachment to the labor force , and so on. The\nFed can address that , to some extent , if—you know, if we ’re able to get the economy closer to\n\nPage full employment, then some people who are discouraged or who have been unemployed for a\nlong time might find that they have opportunities to rejoin the labor market .\nBut I think, fundamentally , that tr aining our workforce to fit the needs of 21st -century\nindustry in the world that we have today is the job of both the private educational sector and the government educational sector . We have many strengths in our educational sector , including\noutstanding universities , but we have a lot of weaknesses , as you know . There are many, many\nfactors that affect participation —employment, wages , and so on, but the one I think that we can\nmost directly affect is the skill level of our workforce . And that doesn’ t mean everybody has to\ngo to get a Ph .D. People have different needs, different interests . But that , I think, is one of the\nbiggest challenges that our society faces , and if we don’ t address it, then we ’re going to see a\nlarger and larger number of people who are either unemployed, underemployed, or working at very low wages , which obviously is not something we want to see.\nThank you."
