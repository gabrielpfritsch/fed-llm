  "text": "CHAI R POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The\nunemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer -\nrun objective.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developm ents. I ’ll have more\nto say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nFollowing growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the\nfirst quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports\nahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing has complicated GDP mea surement. Private\ndomestic purchases, or PDFP , as we call them —which excludes net exports, inventory\ninvestment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate. Within PDFP, growth\nof consumer spending moderated, while investment in equip ment and intangibles rebounded\nfrom weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a\ndecline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concer ns. It remains to be seen how these developments might\naffect future spending and investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.4 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year —somewhat\nslower than project ed in March.\n\nIn the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged\n135,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains\nlow and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggest s that conditions in the\nlabor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pres sures. The median projection for the\nunemployment rate in the SEP is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and next, a bit higher than projected in March.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid -2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer- run goal. Estimates based on the consumer p rice i ndex\nand other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May\nand that —excluding the volatile food and energy categories —core PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent. Near -term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as\nreflected in both market - and survey -based measures. Respond ents to surveys of consumers,\nbusinesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer -term expectations remain consistent with our\n2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation this year is —is\n3 percent, somewhat higher than projected in March. The median inflation projection falls to 2.4 percent in 2026 and 2.1 percent in 2027.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today ’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent and to\ncontinue reducing the size of our balance sheet. We will continue to determine the appropriate\n\nstance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks.\nChanges to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies continue to evolve, and\ntheir effects on the economy remain uncertain. The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic\neffects, reached a peak in April and have since declined. Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.\nThe effects on inflation could be short lived —reflecting a one -time shift in the price\nlevel . It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent . Avoiding\nthat outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer -term inflation expectations well\nanchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent\na one -time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to\nmeet that obligation, we will balance our maximum- employment and price -stability mandates,\nkeeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.\nWe may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual -mandate goals are\nin tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps w ould be anticipated to\nclose. For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\n\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. The median projection projects —participant —median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this\nyear, the same as projected in March. The median projection declines to 3.6 percent at the end of\nnext year and to 3.4 percent at the end of 2027, a little higher than the March projection. These individual forecasts are always subject to uncertainty, and, as I have noted, uncertainty is unusually elevated. And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or decision.\nAt this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five -year review\nof our monetary policy framework. We focused on issues related to assessing the risks and uncertainties that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implic ations for policy\nstrategy and communications. Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide\nrange of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference that\nwe held last month. We are open to new ideas a nd critical feedback, and we will take on board\nlessons of the last five years in determining our findings. We intend to wrap up any\nmodifications to our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy by late\nsummer. After that, we will consider enhancements to our suite of communications tools,\nincluding the SEP.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy : maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\n\nservice to our public mission. And w e at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. To what extent\nhas the more limited impact from tariffs at this stage on inflation changed your view on what the ultimate economic fallout will be from these policies and the timing of when they will materialize in the data?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’ve had three months of , of favorable inflation readings since\nthe high readings of January and February, and that ’s, of course , highly welcome news. Part of\nthat just is that services , core services —both housing services and nonhousing services have\nreally been grinding down toward levels that are —that are consistent with 2 percent inflation. So\nthat’s the good news. We’ ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course , we\nexpect —as you—as you point out , we, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the\nsummer. It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer.\nA good example of that would be , goods being sold at retailers today may have been\nimported several months ago—before tariffs were imposed —so we ’re beginning to see some\neffects . And we do expect to see more of them over coming months. We do —we do also see\nprice increases in some of the relevant categories like personal computers and audio -visual\nequipment —things like that that are attributable to tariff increases. In addition, we look at\nsurveys of businesses, and there , there are many of those . And, a nd, you, you do see a range of\nthings, but , but many, many companies do expect to—to , to put all or —some or all of the effect\n\nof tariffs through to the next , next person in the —in the chain and, ultimately , to the consumer.\nToday—you know, the amount of these —the , the amount of the tariff effects, the size of the\ntariff effects, their duration , and the time it will take are all highly uncertain . So that , that is why\nwe think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more, and we think our\npolicy stance is , is in a good place —where we ’re well positioned to react to incoming\ndevelopments.\nCOLBY SMITH. So in terms of how we should interpret the rate cuts penciled into the\nSEP, is this reflecting that there ’s this expectation that underlying inflation will just stay well\nenough contained that allows the Committee to eventually move ahead with those cuts? Or is it about , you know, responding to a deterioration in economic activity, let ’s say? I mean, how\nshould we make sense of the forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at the forecast, you will see that people do generally\nexpect inflation to move up and then to come back down. But we can ’t just assume that . Of\ncourse , we don ’t know that, and, you know, our, our job is to make sure —one of our jobs —to\nmake sure that a one -time increase in inflation doesn ’t turn into an inflation problem. And that ,\nagain —that will depend on the size of the effects, how long it takes for them to come in, and ,\nand, ultimately , on, on keeping inflation expectat ions anchored.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, and thanks , Chair Powell. Howard Schneider with\nReuters. If you look at the , the rate path starting in December to today and adjust it over the full\ntime horizon you’ ve got there, you’ ve taken about ¼ point per year out of your projected path.\nAnd you end at a higher rate in end- 2027 than you were —would have in the prior forecast. Is\nthat a result of, of a sense that tariffs will lead to more persistent inflation? Is it a result of\n\nreassessments of where your short -term neutral rate is? Is it—why , why are you on a slower\npath now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would focus most on the —on the nearer term . As you think —as\nyou get out to the —to the later years, it ’s hard to —it’ s hard for anybody to know where the\neconomy is going. You didn’ t see people moving their longer -term, you know, estimate of the\nneutral rate, for example, at this meeting. So —and those things are probably slow moving. So I\nthink—I think if you look at what ’s happening here since March —this is since March, right? —\nyou see a little slower growth, just a tiny tick up, one-tenth tick up, in , in unemployment, and\nyou see inflation moving up three -tenths . And by the way, it was —it was a similar move from\nthe December SEP to the March. So that ’s what you see . You see the , the effects of tariffs. I\nthink we learned in April, after the March meeting, that substantially higher tariffs were likely,\nand then since then, the estimates of where the tariffs will be have actually moved back down,\nalthough still at an elevated level. So we’re adapting in real time, and what you see is , you\nknow, an, an accumulation of individual assessments.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Okay, but you say in the statement that risks have diminished\non that front, but the July 9, you know, drop- dead date for all the , the Liberation Day tariffs is\nstill out there and unresolved. You ’ve got now an exchange of missiles between two Middle\nEast adversaries, with a possible U.S. involvement —how can you justify saying that risks have\ndiminished?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we said was that uncertainty has, has —uncertainty about the\neconomic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. Many, many surveys say that. They do. So—and, and, that ’s—that’s actually a line from the Tealbook, which you can see in five years.\nRemember to check that. [Laughter]\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Maybe the world will be over by then. [Laughter]\nCHAIR POWELL. No —but if you think of that, tariff uncertainty —uncertainty really\npeaked in April and since then has come down. And that ’s—that’s really what that’ s just\nacknowledging. It’ s diminished but still elevated —that it’ s uncertainty. So I think that ’s an\naccurate statement.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. There is\nan argument out there in favor of cutting rates more immediately. Inflation has continued to cool and is back at roughly 2 percent, despite the tariffs. And I guess I also wanted to ask about , you\nknow, cracks in the job market , with gross hiring slowing —concentrated in just a few industries.\nWe’ve seen some housing data, including this morning, that have been pretty weak. Do you see\nany concerns that, you know, the economy i s weakening and that is a reason to cut rates going\nforward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do—we do , of course , monitor all those things. I , I think if\nyou look at the overall picture, you know, what you’ re seeing is 4.2 percent unemployment and\nan economy that ’s growing at a —at a rate hard to know , given the , the unusual flows in the first\nquarter . But it appears to be 1½, 2 percent —maybe a little better than that. Sentiment has come\nup off of its very low levels. It ’s still —it’ s still depressed . So, you know, you can—you can\npoint to things —the housing market is a longer -run problem and also a short -run problem. I\ndon’t think it’ s indicative of—you know, basically , the situation is , we have a longer -run\nshortage of housing, and we also have high rates right now. I think the best thing we can do for the housing market is to restore price stability in a sustainable way and, and create a strong labor market, and that ’s the best thing we can do for the housing market. You asked about the job\n\nmarket—again, look at labor force participation. Look at wages . Look at job creation. They ’re\nall at healthy levels now. I , I would say you can see perhaps a very, very slow continued\ncooling, but nothing that ’s troubling at this time. But, you know, we watch it —we watch it very,\nvery carefully. So , overall, again, the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well\npositioned to respond in a timely way to economic developments , and—for now —and we ’ll be\nwatching the data carefully.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Well, just quickly on—given that , you know, there are\nconcerns inflation will rise —but there is the alternate scenario that tariffs would create demand\ndestruction and slow growth sufficiently and that would perhaps keep a bit of a lid on inflation.\nDo you see odds of that scenario, what kind of odds do you see of that scenario coming true, and\nhow many months of cool inflation would you need to see before concluding that maybe that lower -inflation scenario is taking place?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is very much the conversation we had today and yesterday.\nThere , there are many, many different scenarios —many combinations of scenarios where\ninflation does or doesn’ t prove out to be at the levels we think and where the labor market does\nor doesn’ t soften. And I think what , what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of\nvery high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is. No one holds these, these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they’ re all\ngoing to be data dependent. And that —you can make a case for , for any of the rate paths, I\nthink, that you see in, in the SEP. And , you know, we do this once a quarter . It’s—it’s a hard\nthing to do at this —particularly at this time. But it does reflect—you know, if you see somebody\nwriting down, you know, a , a rate path that involves cuts, that ’s them saying, “Y es, I think we\nwill get to a place , more likely than not, where cuts will be appropriate. ” And it could be —it\n\ncould be a joint probability of a number of possible outcomes. Again, remember how much\nuncertainty we face, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I wonder if you could describe for us some\nof those scenarios. How do you get to a place —I’m noticing that the uncertainty levels in your\nforecast are very high. How do you get to a place where you have the confidence in the outlook\nfor—say , inflation and/or growth or the unemployment rate —how many months does it take, and\nwhat do you want to see in the data to get to that level of confidence to actually reduce rates off the restrictive level?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s—it’s —again , it’s very, very hard to say when that will\nhappen. We know that the time will come ; it come —could come quickly. I t could not come\nquickly. As long as the economy is solid, though —as long as we ’re seeing the kind of labor\nmarket that we have and reasonably decent growth and inflation moving down, we feel like the\nright thing to do is to be where we are, with where our policy stance is, and just learn more. And\nin particular, we feel like we ’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs. We\ndo—we hadn’ t expected them to show up much by now, and they haven ’t, and we will see\nwhether —the extent to which they do over , over coming months. And I think that ’s going to\ninform our thinking, for one thing. In addition, we’ll see how the labor market progresses. So ,\nat some point , it will become clear. I can ’t tell you exactly when that will be . And, you know,\nmeanwhile , we’ll be watching, watching the labor market very carefully for signs of weakness\nand strength and tariffs for signs of , of what ’s going to happen there. And , of course, there are\nmany developments ahead, you know, even in the near term —developments are expected on\ntariffs. So I think we , we don’ t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out. We\n\nhave an estimate, and it ’s a pretty —I think all estimates are now pretty close together. But it’ s—\nit’s, yeah, highly uncertain.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. When you say “ estimate” —estimate of the impact of tariffs on the\ncore PCE —is that what it is ? And c an you share that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, what you start with is , is—what ’s the effective tariff rate\noverall? And people are managing to that. But , you know, the, the pass -through of tariffs to\nconsumer price inflation is a whole process that ’s very uncertain. You know, a s you know, there\nare many parties in that chain : There’s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer,\nand the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to, to pay for the\ntariff. But together , they will all pa y for it together —or maybe one party will pay it all. But that\nprocess is very hard to predict, and we haven’ t been through a situation like this, and I think we\nhave to be humble about our ability to forecast it. So that ’s why we need to see some actual data\nto have —to make better decisions . We, we’d like to get some , some more data, and , and, again,\nin the meantime , we can do that because the economy remains in solid condition.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I guess I ’m\nwondering if you could explain a little more the divergence we see in the dot plot, particularly\naround the 2025 rate projections. I realize this is —you know, you have one group of officials\nthat are putting down no cuts, another that are putting down more than one —and recognizing\nthat could be difficult to summarize, but is it a matter of people having a different outlook or a\ndifferent reaction function? A different commitment to defending against another inflation\nmistake? How , how did that play out over the last two days?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right, we —and, as is often the case, we have a pretty\nhealthy diversity of views on the Committee. We did have strong support for today ’s decision\nand broad agreement that our policy stance does leave us in a good place. But I would point to\ntwo factors, and you mentioned them. The first is just that parties have a diversity of forecasts,\nand, and they do align with, with where —with where their dots are. So if you have a higher\ninflation forecast, you ’re going to be less likely to be writing down, you know, more, more cuts.\nBut as —remember, as we see more data, we’ re going to learn more about where inflation is\nheaded . And that means when it is time to look at , at normal —at sort of, at, you know —\nresuming our normalization process, the differences you may —you see should be smaller\nbecause we’ ll have seen actual data. Right now , it’s just a forecast in a very foggy time. So\nthat’s the first part —is forecast.\nSecondly, people can look at the same data , and they can evaluate the risks differently, as\nyou know. And that includes , you know, the, the risk of higher inflation, the risk it’ ll be more\npersistent, the risk that the labor market will weaken —people are going to have different\nassessments of that risk. So you put that in there , too. So those are the two ways that , that —the\ntwo things , I think, that drive these things. Remember , though, with—as I mentioned earlier —\nwith uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with a lot of conviction. So that’s really where it is. It’s a function of those things, and I think as the data come in, you\nshould see those differences diminish.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up—you’ ve said the policy is in a good place, and\nthat it’ s modestly restrictive. Given all the uncertainty —you just talked about tariff levels,\nuncertainty around the pass -through —is it price increases versus margin compression ?—some of\n\nthe softness that Chris talked about in, in labor and housing. W hy wouldn’ t it be better to have\nrates at a more neutral setting as the economy heads into this period of very high uncertainty?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you just look backward at the data, that, that’s what you would\nsay, but that ’s not —we have to be forward looking. A nd the thing that every forecaster —every\noutside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to\narrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account. So I think a backward- looking\nlook would, would lead you to a neutral stance. B ut we , we can’t—we have to —we have to look\nat that. A nd because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what ’s going\nto happen. It, i t’s, you know, the —there ’s a range of possibilities on how , how large the , the\ninflation effects and the o ther effects are going to be. So we ’ll make smarter and better decisions\nif we just wait a couple of months or however long it takes to get a sense of , of really what , what\nis going to be the pass -through of inflation and what’re —what ’s going to be the effects on\nspending and on hiring and all those things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mr. McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Your\nfriend down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue continues to lob insults in your direction. And I ’m\nwondering, given now that the Supreme Court has maybe carved out the Fed from some of the legal implications of that, whether this is just noise that the markets and everybody should ignore until your term is up or whether you worry that it could lead to more pressure on confidence on Wall Street —on consumers —about the outlook for the economy.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, from my standpoint, it ’s—it’s not complicated. What\neveryone on the FOMC wants is a good, solid American economy with a strong labor market and, and price stability. That’s what we want . We think our policy is well positioned to—right\n\nnow to, to deliver that and , and to be able to respond in a timely way as the data lead us around.\nThe economy’ s been resilient, and part of that is our stance, and , again, we think we ’re—we’re\nin a good place on that to respond to significant economic developments. That ’s what matters.\nThat is what matters to us—pretty much, that ’s all that matters to us.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I need to ask —assuming you are not reappointed, would you stay\non as G overnor when your term as C hair ends?\nCHAIR POWELL. I ’m—I’m not thinking about that. I’m thinking about this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks , Mr. Chairman. I guess with workplace raids\nincreasing, picking up significantly —what kind of e ffect would that have on the labor market in\nthe short term?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, sorry —with what picking up?\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Workplace raids.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah , ah, immigration —so you’ re asking immigration?\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Yeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, you know —I, I wouldn’ t want to speculate. What —one way\nto get at that from an economic standpoint —we , of course , don ’t comment on immigration\npolicy. I t’s not ours to make or comment on. B ut what you see is a —an, an unemployment rate\nthat has been really solid and at a low level —not really increasing. It’s been in a— in a good\nrange and well within the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment. And that\nmeans, like, part of that is that labor demand and labor supply are kind of moving down at the\nsame rate. Labor demand is , is softening—you see that in job creation— but it ’s still kind of at a\nhealthy level. And labor supply is , is diminishing because the , the immigration numbers that we\n\nsee are, are much lower than they were. So the —those two factors , supply and demand —that ’s\nwhat has kept the , the unemployment rate in a reasonably, you know, stable place.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay, thanks. The other thing I want ed to follow up on is if\nyou could— if you could elaborate on the potential changes to the SEP that you suggested were\npart of the framework review, I think .\nCHAIR POWELL. So the framework review really has two tracks, right? The first track\nis our —is our policy framework. T hat, that is reflected in the consensus statement . And we,\nwe’ve said that we would finish that and announce it by the end of the summer. So we ’re well\nalong in that process. We ’ve had the meetings that we need to have, and we ’re now going to be\ngoing into [cough] —pardon me —into discussions about , you know, specific changes to\nlanguage. So that ’s—that’s the framework part of it. The s econd part of it is our\ncommunications tools and practices [cough] —pardon me —and that , that part comes next, okay?\nThat’s what we ’re going to do in the meetings this fall. Actually, what we did at this meeting ,\nthough, is we , we sort of prepared the ground for that. We had a —we had a meeting where we\ntalked at a high level about a number of ideas.\nThe SEP is part of it—you know, other —many, many other ideas . It’s—it’s sort of—\nhow do we think our communications can be improved? There are a number of ideas. P eople\noffered a really —it was a great conversation . Number of ideas —but we ’re—we’re going to look\nat those with staff briefing and a lot of thought in the fall. And I would say, when it comes to\nchanging communications , you know, I would only do—I would only support things really that\nonly—implement things that have very broad support. And al so, you want to be really careful,\nbecause I think our communications are pretty well received. T hey’re not broken, so more is not\n\nnecessarily better —but better is better. So we ’re going to be looking at ways to do—to do things\nthat will improve the clarity of what we do for the benefit of, of the public.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O ’GRADY. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kelly O ’Grady, CBS News. You ’re\nfamously known as the guy that makes decision based on data instead of speculation. You ’ve\nsaid today in —the inflation data is in a good place —we don’ t know how tariffs are going to\nimpact prices going forward —that ’s uncertain. But I ’ve got to go back to the last time that you\ncut rates in December, and there was still the what -if of tariffs. So what made you feel\ncomfortable cutting then , when inflation was higher than where it is t oday —and you didn’ t cut\ntoday?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the , the forecast for inflation in December was 2 ½ core PCE\nfor 2025—the forecast was 2 ½ percent —which is a good inflation forecast. I think what we ’ve\nlearned is that —and this was long before we had any idea of what the actual policies would be .\nWe’ve learned the tariffs are going to be substantially larger than , than forecasters generally\nthought. And , you know, we, we don’ t—our , our forecasts are generally not particularly\ndifferent from those of other, you know, well -resourced forecasting operations. So what we\nlearned —and particularly in April— was that substantially larger tariffs were coming and that\nthat would mean higher inflation. That ’s what happened. And so you—now you see —you saw\n2½ percent forecast in December . You saw 2.8 percent in March, and you see 3.1 percent now.\nSo it’s six-tenths higher inflation for 2025, and that ’s—that’s a big part of , of the change. And\nthat’s—that’s due to the effects of , of the tariffs that are —you know, we , we don’ t know where\n\nthey’ re going to land, but it ’s pretty apparent they ’re going to land higher than outside\nforecasters were really guessing at the end of last year.\nKELLY O ’GRADY. My follow -up to that —I think consumers —right ?—were looking\nfor relief on rates when it comes to mortgages —car loans . Small businesses want to take out\nmore manageable loans. When you look at the cumulative inflation over the past five years,\nprices have risen over 20 percent —it’s been a rough road. So what is the tipping point , then, for\nthe wait -and-see approach in terms of how much it ’s going to help versus when it hurts the\nAmerican consumer?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean , we’re trying to restore price —the best thing we can do\nfor the —for the public that we serve is restore price stability. If we can, and we will , restore\nprice stability, meaning 2 percent inflation on a durable, sustainable basis —that and also\nmaximum employment —and if we , we restore those things, that ’s the best thing . And that is our\ngoal. The best thing we can do for the American people —for , for households and businesses —\nthat is the ultimate thing that we can deliver. And they can make their decisions without having\nto think about inflation all the time. So, in the meantime, we have to keep rates high to keep —to\nget inflation all the way down. They ’re not very high—let ’s be honest . I would say policy is\nmodestly or moderately —probably modestly now —restrictive. If you look at the economy, it ’s\nnot performing as though it were performing under very strict monetary policy —very restrictive\nmonetary policy. So I would say probably modestly restrictive —and so what it will take is, is\nconfidence that inflation is coming down.\nNow, I would say, without tariffs, that confidence would be building because if you —if\nyou see what ’s happening with nonhousing services and housing services, which are the other\ntwo big pieces other than goods, those are coming down really nicely now . So I think we have to\n\nlearn a little more about, about tariffs. I don’ t know —I don’ t know what the right way for us to\nreact will be. I think it ’s hard to know with, with any confidence how we should react until we\nsee, really , the size of the effects— then we can start to make a better judgment. So that ’s what\nwe’re doing, and I think we can—we can take the time to do that , because unemployment is\n4.2 percent. Wages are moving up. R eal wages are moving up at a—at a healthy clip now. And\ninflation is , you know —2.3 percent headline inflation over a 12- month basis. So it ’s a good\neconomy, and a solid economy with decent growth.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. So you’ re saying that uncertainty\nhas come down, the economy is moving at a solid pace, inflation has come down over the past\nthree months, and this is all moving in the right direction. So are you indicating here that Americans should expect some sort of economic pain in the second half of the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not —I’m not saying that at all. You know, f rom our standpoint,\nwhat I can say is that the , the U.S. economy is in solid shape . Inflation has come down. T he\nunemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent . As I mentioned, real wages are moving up. I t’s a—\nit’s a good —job creation is at a healthy level . Unemployment , again, as I said, low —labor force\nparticipation at a good place. What we ’re waiting for to reduce rates is , is to understand what\nwill happen with, with , really , the tariff inflation. And there ’s a lot of uncertainty about that .\nEvery forecaster you can name who, you know —who is a professional , you know, forecaster\nwith, with adequate resources and forecasts for a living is forecasting , you know, a pretty\nsignificant —everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming\nmonths from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs. And it will be someone in that\nchain that I mentioned : Between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer—\n\nultimately , somebody putting it into a , a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it —and,\nyou know, all through that, that chain , people will be trying not to be the ones who, who pick up\nthe cost . But, ultimately , the cost of the tariff has to be paid. And some of it will fall on the end\nconsumer. We know that because that ’s what businesses say —that ’s what the , the data say from\npast—so we know that ’s coming. And we just want to see , see a little bit of that before we make\njudgments prematurely.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And follow -up on that —so you’ ve spent years , though,\ntalking about how , how you’ re data dependent , and be a little more direct on this . You know,\nnow you’ re making decisions looking forward— doesn’ t the data you’ re seeing today indicate\nthere should be a rate cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I mean , you ’re—monetary policy has to be forward looking.\nThat is elementary. You ’ve got to be looking—I always—we always talk about the incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We say that over and over and over again,\nright? So it’s always forward looking. Y ou know, if you know —at the very beginning of the\npandemic, you know, we cut rates to zero immediately . Nothing had happened. W e just knew\nthat it was going to be really bad, right? So we took very aggre ssive forward looking—because\nwe knew things were going to be unusually difficult. So, of course , this , this is something we ,\nwe sort of know is coming—we just don’ t know the size of it . And, again, the economy seems to\nbe in solid shape. So the labor market’ s not crying out for a rate cut. Businesses, you know,\nwere in a bit of shock after April 2 . But you see business sentiment —you talk to business people\nnow—there ’s a very different feeling now that people are working their way through this . And\nthey, they understand how they’ re going to go, and it’s —it, it feels much more positive and\n\nconstructive than it did three months ago, let ’s say. So, again, we think that our current stance of\nmonetary policy is in a good place.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you. Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg. Chair Powell,\nin February, you told Congress that the Fed is “overworked, maybe , not overstaffed. ” Then , in a\nmemo to —a memo to staff in May announcing a deferred resignation program at the Fed, you\nsaid you wanted to ensure that the Fed was “right- sized. ” Those two statements appear to be at\nodds with one another. Could you explain what changed in the roughly three months between\nthose statements that made you decide that staff levels at the Fed should decline?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t see them at all as, as in tension. You know, s o I was asked,\n“Is the Fed overstaffed? ” And I said , “No.” You know, a nd I sort of said as a pun,\n“Overworked, but not overstaffed.” People do work extremely hard at the Fed, and I know they\nwork hard at Bloomberg, too. [Laughter] So —but we do. W e work hard. B ut I would say\nthis—so we are careful stewards of public resources, and sometimes you need to show that. So\nthere ’ve been several times in our history —modern history —where the Fed has said, “Y ou know\nwhat ? We ’re going to do a buyout . We’re going to—going to show the public . We’re going to\ndemonstrate that we are good stewards of public resources.” So we thought —and I , I thought —\nthat this is a time when we can . You know, we’ve —we grow about —our headcount has grown\nat about 1 percent a year. So over the course of a couple of years, we ’re going to—we’re doing a\ncareful scrub of the Board and all of the R eserve Banks, and we ’re going to find 10 percent of\nemployees who can do something else.\nWhere, where we can —we can streamline our operations —and we , we think we can get\nthere in a year, in a couple of years . We think we can do that . And we think the —we think the,\n\nthe—this is , this is without taking risk to carrying out our critical missions. So this is something\nyou do very carefully— thoughtfully. A nd you do it , again, respecting that we have critical\nmissions to carry out. I ’ve had experience —a lot of experience —in my prior careers , you know,\nwith headcount reductions and things like that, and this is how you do it professionally. You do\nit carefully —thoughtfully—with a lot of planning, and you do it over a period of time. And I, I\nthink it ’s—I think the Fed w ill be fine . I think no one will notice any decline in our ability to\ncarry out our missions, and I think it ’s just us wanting to demonstrate to the public that we are\nactually good stewards of their—of their resources. We’ re—we’re effectively wiping out\n10 years of headcount growth with this. So, I mean, we just —we wanted to show that, you\nknow —that we ’re good stewards.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. How is progress on reducing the headcount going so far? Are\nyou on track to meet the goal?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ re just at the very beginning. As you know, we ’re doing a\nbuyout program. We ’re going to—we’re going to hit that goal. I think many organizations find\nthat they can —that they can do this. You don’ t want to do it every year or anything, but you can\ndo it at intervals . And you, you wind up not , you know —not interfering with your ability to\nperform your jobs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Chair Powell, Claire Jones from t he Financial Times. As you’ re no\ndoubt aware, the Senate Finance Committee has tabled its version of the reconciliation bill this\nweek, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the tenor of the debate at the FOMC over the past few days on fiscal policy and the degree to which that influenced people ’s\nprojections for 2026 and beyond. Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so , you know, we don ’t—we don ’t sit around and debate or\nreally discuss —we , we take fiscal policy as fully exogenous . And so we , we actually , you know,\nreally didn ’t talk about , about the bill or the contents of it. It’s still evolving. You know, w hen,\nwhen it gets close—closer —remember also we have a very, very large economy , and that the\neffects will be at the margin. And , you know, I, I expect that they’ ll—they may already be in—\nbut they will be in by the next meeting. W e’ll make an estimate. But it ’s not a major thing; it’s\nnothing that we discuss. It, it may have been men tioned a couple of times —but as something\nthat’s coming in. But I think the outcome is —you know, we don’ t know the outcome yet\nthere —so , hard to be real specific.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks , Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. There ’ve been some\ncutbacks in economic statistic s collection in the last few weeks—w orries that long -running\nproblems around funding and response rates may be getting worse. How much is this concern on\nyour radar? How much confidence do you have that the gauges you’ re watching to assess the\neconomy are reliable right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, t wo things —one, the data we get right now —we , we can\ndo our jobs. I’m not concerned that we can ’t do our jobs. That ’s not the —that ’s not the point.\nThe point , really , is that we are starting to see, you know, layoffs . And, and important gatherers\nof data are saying that they ’re—they’re having to cut back on the size of their surveys. That ’s\ngoing to lead to more volatility in the surveys. I think we should take a step back. A nd, you\nknow, from our standpoint —and I think the s tandpoint of businesses and governments and\neveryone —having really good data on the state of the economy at any given time is a huge\npublic good. It helps . It doesn’ t just help the Fed . It helps the government, it helps Congress, it\n\nhelps the e xecutive branch. More importantly , really, it helps businesses. They need to know\nwhat ’s going on in the economy. The United States has been a leader for many, many years in\nthis whole project of measuring and understanding what ’s happening in, in our very large and\ndynamic economy.\nAnd I hate to see —I hate to see us cutting back on that because it , it is a real benefit to\nthe general public that people in all kinds of jobs have the best possible understanding of what ’s\nhappening in the economy and, and, hence, what ’s likely to happen. It ’s very hard to measure\nwhat ’s going on in the U.S. economy. If, if you read—there was a book called —well , it’s really\nremarkable how many things you need to understand to estimate U.S. GDP . Very, very\ndifficult—a nd it’s so important that we get it right. I just would —I just would say it ’s not a\nplace to —I would want to keep investing in that , you know, for the good of the general public.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. So you’ re conducting this\nmonetary policy strategy framework review, but next year we ’re supposed to have a new Fed\nChair, and I ’m wondering if that affects at all the way that you ’re approaching this. How do you\nensure that this framework will actually be durable?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, t he framework goes back to —the framework document\ngoes back to 2012, and it ’s—it’s the Committee ’s document. It’s not like we ’re going to invent a\nbrand new way to do things. It ’s—it’s been an evolving document, so it shouldn’ t depend on\nwho the C hair is at all. It should depend on what ’s happening in the economy and what the\nCommittee wants to do. So, yeah, it isn’ t really tied to any particular C hair, and, you know, we\nused to renew it every year . Now we do it every five year s. So—but I , I don’t think anybody—\nI’ve never heard anyone raise this issue that , you know, a new C hair might want to come in and\n\ngo in a completely different direction. I really —I really don’t think that ’s right . But, you know,\nthat’s not —not going to be up to me to decide.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Is that affecting at all that you’re—who you’re consulting with —\nCHAIR POWELL. No, not at all. Not in any way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATT EGAN. Thank you, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. Relatively low gas\nprices this year have helped drive down inflation in recent reports, but that trend is starting to\nreverse, given the crisis in the Middle East. How are you thinking about how the Israel –Iran\nconflict will impact the economy, especially inflation, and what lessons were learned during the 2022 period when another conflict, the Russia –Ukraine w ar, sent oil and gas prices\nskyrocketing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , of course, we ’re watching —like everybody else is —what ’s going\non. I really don ’t have any comment on that. You know, possible that , that we’ll see higher\nenergy prices —what’s tended to happen is , when there ’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see\na spike in energy prices —but tends to come down. Those things don’ t generally tend to have\nlasting effects on inflation, although, of course , in the 1970s , they famously did, because you had\na series of very, very large shocks. But we haven’ t seen anything like that —that —like that now.\nThe U.S. economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s. So, but —\nMATT EGAN. A quick follow -up—I’ve just got to ask you about artificial intelligence.\nSome technology executives have recently been warning that AI could wipe out a large chunk of entry -level jobs and significantly increase the unemployment rate. I’m wondering how\nconcerned you are, if at all, about the threat that AI poses to employment.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the question. The question really is, will AI be more\naugmenting labor or replacing labor? And I wouldn’ t—I, I —we all see those announcements,\nincluding one today. I wouldn’ t overread a, a couple of data points , because, you know, AI\nshould be creating jobs at the same time. It may be replacing —it may be doing both. Anyone\nwho’s done any work with it —with AI —will, will have been a little bit stunned at how capable it\nis. And it ’s just a different thing. So I think this is something that certainly has transformational\npotential —and probably we ’re in the very early stages of it. They say what you’ re seeing now\ncompared to what you’ ll see in two years is, is going to be very different and even more\neffective. So I think it ’s really hard to know. You know, of course , there are optimists who feel\nlike it’ s going to make everybody much more , you know —muc h more productive . And there are\nthose who think it ’s going to replace an awful lot of jobs right across the income spectrum —you\nknow, white collar, blue collar, and everything. So I just don ’t know. We don’ t—we don’t have\na “house view ” on that . But this is —this is going to be a very important question for some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from Market Watch. I was wondering if you\ncould step back a little bit, Chair Powell. You know, t here’s a spate of articles and a lot of op-\neds now in the newspapers saying that the U.S. economy and the global economy is going\nthrough this profound change, you know, akin to the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s .\nAnd don’ t you owe the American people , like , some sort of , like, explanation for what we ’re\ngoing through? I mean , I, I noticed earlier this month when you, you talked about Bretton\nWoods a little bit, and you said that Bretton Woods —the Fed staff had to, like , change how\nthey’ve —the dollar —movements of the dollar was impacting the economy. Are we going\n\nthrough something like that now —that , you know —are you having to change how you do\nmonetary policy? Is it—is it that fundamental of a change under way? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s—it’s certainly a time of real change —you know, f rom a\ngeopolitical standpoint, from a trade standpoint, from an immigration standpoint —you see this\nnot just here , but everywhere. So there’s —there ’s quite a lot going on. It doesn’ t change the\nway we do monetary policy in the near term. I mean, but —and it doesn ’t change our objectives\nor what we need to do. And, you know, these, these things are not really our issues— they’ re\nreally issues for elected governments. All of those issues are really for elected governments.\nBut there ’s no question it ’s a time of , of real, real change —and very hard to see where that goes.\nWill it be —there have been many, many things written about how it ’s going to be a more\ninflationary time. That ’s possible ; it’s not guaranteed. Y ou know, AI could cut in a very other\ndirection . AI could make people much more productive and —and push in the other direction. I\ndon’t know , though. So you’ re right, but , honestly, our focus is , is a much more practical one,\nand that is, how do we keep inflation low and, and employment high in the near term? That’s\nreally what we’ re about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mark. Mark Hamrick .\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Hello , Chairman Powell. Mark Hamrick with\nBankrate. What is the view about the growing amount of slack in the job market, including the\nsoftening in payrolls, the forecast of a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and the ability of workers to demand wage hikes or not in this environment where you have inflation surging?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t, you don ’t see—you don’ t really see unemployment going up.\nYou don’ t see increased slack , really —I mean , at the margin. Remember, you’ re at 4.2 percent\nunemployment . That, that was for many, many years —that was an extremely low level. It\n\nhappens to have come up off of an even lower level. As we came out of the pandemic , we were\nas low as 3.4 percent. But 4.2 percent is probably at the low end of estimates of the longer -run,\nyou know, sustainable level of natural rate of unemployment. So I wouldn’ t—I guess I wouldn’ t\nagree with that. And also, in terms of wages —you know, real wages after inflation have been\nmoving up sort of more than was consistent with 2 percent inflation. They ’re still moving up at\na—at a healthy clip—and I think much more consistent with 2 percent inflation , given , given a , a\nreasonable assessment of , of trend productivity. So it’s a pretty good labor market. You know,\nyou’re right that the level of job creation has come down, but so has the supply of workers —the\nchange in the supply—the, the new supply.\nSo you’ ve seen —you’ ve seen the unemployment rate remain pretty stable at 4.2 . It’s\nbeen as high as 4.3, but , you know, those are —those are good numbers. So it ’s a pretty good\nlabor market. There’s— the thing is, there ’s—a more concerning thing is , there ’s not —there are\nnot a lot of layoffs, but there are not a lot of , of job creation. The number —if you’ re out of\nwork, it ’s—it’s hard to find a job. But very few people are being laid off at this point. So\nthat’s—an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully , because if there were to be, you know,\nsignificant layoffs and the job- finding rate were to remain this low, you would have a lot —you\nwould have an increase in unemployment fairly quickly. But that hasn ’t happened. It really\nhasn’t happened. We’ re—so the U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to, to\nweaken, really , over the last three years, and it ’s been remarkable to see—just again and again\nwhen people think it ’s going to weaken out. Eventually it will, but we don’ t see signs of\nthat now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Jean for the last question.\n\nJEAN YUNG. Hi , Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. There ’s been a lot\nof talk about cuts. I wanted to ask you—why do you think there are no forecasts for rates to rise\nor, or even to stay where they are next year, given that the projection for inflation is to rise to\n3 percent and there ’s a lot of —there ’s some skepticism over whether those price hikes will be a\none-time event ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there are a number of people on the Committee who wrote down\nno cuts this year but some cuts next year. So, look, I think, you know, people are writing down their most likely path, right? They ’re not saying there ’s zero possibility of other things, really.\nReally , it’s—think of it as the least unlikely path in a situation like this where uncertainty is very\nhigh. I , I think—a gain, people write —they write down their , their rate paths , and they do not\nhave , like , a really high conviction that this is exactly what ’s going to happen over the next two\nyears. No one feels that way about their rate path. They feel like, “W hat am I going to write\ndown? ” I mean, what would you write down? It ’s not easy to , to be —to do that with\nconfidence.\nSo I would just say it that way. We don ’t rule things in or out —certainly , a hike is not\nthe base case at all . It’s not something people are writing down. But , in the meantime, we do the\nbest we can with these forecasts, and I , I think they’ re—they’re representative of , you know, of\nthe different forecasts and different reaction functions that people on the Committee have.\nSo thank you very much. Thanks."
