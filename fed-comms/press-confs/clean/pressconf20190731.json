  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. We decided today to lower the target\nfor the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2 ¼ percent. The\noutlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable , and this action is designed to support that\noutlook. It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade\npolicy uncertainty , to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy ,\nand to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. All of these\nobjectives will support achievement of our overarching goal: to sustain the expansion, with a\nstrong job market and inflation close to our objective , for the benefit of the American people.\nWe also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in\nSeptember , as previously planned. And I ’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate\nreduction and then turn to t he path forward.\nAs the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place. The\nunemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent\nobjective for nine months. Our interest rate target was at the low end of estimates of neutral.\nOver the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed\nunemployment to near a half -century low. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying\njobs. People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who\nhave struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their\nlives. This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job\nmarket r eaches more of those left behind.\n\nThrough the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted\ninflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest\nrates. The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about\nany changes and then to today’s action. The median Committee participant’s assessments of the\nneutral rate of interest and the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this\nyear, reinf orcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate. These changes in the\nanticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the\neconomy.\nAt our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the\nfederal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall\ndirection of events. Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments. Job\ngrowth was strong in June and, looking through month- to-month fluctuations, the data point to\ncontinued strength. We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe\nis required to hold the unemployment rate steady.\nGDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations. Consumption—\nsupported by rising incomes and high household confidence —is the main engine driving the\neconomy forward. But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and\nbusiness fixed investment fell in the second quarter. Foreign growt h has disappointed,\nparticularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China. In response to this\nweakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or\ncontemplating doing so. After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled\nover in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer. Looking through this\n\nvariability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies\nmore cautious about their capital s pending.\nThe domestic inflation shortfall has continued. Core inflation, which excludes food and\nenergy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at\n1.6 percent over the past 12 months. We continue to expect tha t inflation will return over time to\n2 percent. But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures\npersist. Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation.\nWe are mindful that inflation’s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued\nbelow -target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult -to-reverse downward slide in\nlonger -term expectations.\nSo taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook.\nOver the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and\nmuted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy\ninterest rate that would best support that outlook. Today, we judg e that those factors warrant the\npolicy adjustment I described : “As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target\nrange for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a\nstrong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.”\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell . Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times . Per\nyour statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point\ncut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target ? And, if not,\n\nwhat are you going to be looking at to convince y ou that you need to cut rates again? What is\nthe hurdle rate there?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I think you have to look at not just the 25 ba sis point cut, but look\nat the C ommittee ’s actions over the course of the year . As I noted in my opening statement, we\nstarted off expecting some rate increases , we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and\nnow we ’ve moved here . I think what you ’ve seen over the course of the year is , as we ’ve moved\nto a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed ju st about as expected\nwith that gradually increasing support . And I think— I wouldn’ t take credit for all of that, but I\ndo think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook\nfavorable .\nIn terms of the rest of your quest ion, the C ommittee is really thinking of this as a way of\nadjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I\nmentioned: to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy , that those\nfactors are —where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation.\nSo we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we ’re thinking of it as essentially in the\nnature of a midcycle adjustment to policy.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. There’ s a\nperception out there that perhaps , in this case , the F ed is something of a hammer in search of a\nnail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don’ t seem to show any\nkind of demand problem in the U.S. A nd when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates,\nthey’ve all come down . And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, you’ re absolutely right . The —the performance of the economy\nhas been reasonably good. The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it ’s been\n\nin a long time, and the outlook is also good. What we’ ve been monitoring since the beginning of\nthe year is , effectively , downside risks to t hat outlook from weakening global growth, and we see\nthat everywhere: weak manufacturing, weak global growth now , particularly in the European\nUnion and China . In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been\ndisruptive and then ha ve been less so, and also inflation running below target . So we see those\nas threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support\nthem and keep that outlook favorable . And , frankly, it is a continuation of what we ’ve been\ndoing all year to provide more support against those very same risks.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . But the follow -up question is, how does it do that? How does\ncutting interest rates lower —or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going , since the cost of\ncapital doesn ’t seem to be the issue here?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I —I really think it does , and I think the evidence of my\neyes tells me that our policy does support —it supports confidence, it supports economic activity,\nhousehold and business confidence, and through channels that we understand. So it will lower\nborrowing costs . It will—and it will work . And I think you see it . Since— you know, since we\nnoted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you\nsaw—I won ’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up. You\nsee confidence, which had troughed in June —you saw it move back up. You see economic\nactivity on a healthy basis . It just—it seems to work through confide nce channels as well as the\nmechanical channels that you are talking about.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from t he Washington Post . You always say that\nthe F ed is data dependent, and much of the data that we ’ve seen since the June meeting has\nsurprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations . Can you give us a sense of how\n\nthat better -than-expected data impacted the FOMC ’s thinking ? And if we keep seeing these\nupside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, yes . I mean , I think we —of course, you know, what we do at\nevery meeting, as I noted, is , we do a deep dive into U.S . economic activity and global activity\nand, certainly , carefully went through U.S . economic activity, which there has been some\npositive and some negative, but , overall , the U.S . economy has shown resilience during the\nintermeeting period. But, again, the —the issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall\nin inflation, and we ’re trying to address those .\nSo, in addition, going forward, I would say, we ’re going to be monitoring those same\nthings . We ’ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low\ninflation . And we ’ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S . econo my. As I\nmentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we ’ll be putting all of that\ntogether , and that ’s how we ’ll be thinking about policy going forward.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman , CNBC . I just want to follow up on that . Would\nyou say we ’re sort of— you guys have gotten into a new regime here? This is sort of an\ninsurance cut and not a data -dependent cut ? And are we now more in the realm of watching\nheadlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers , or—and\ngrowth numbers? What —how do we know what you’ re going to do next , and why now in this\nnew regime?\nCHAIR POWELL . Ye s. So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to i nsure\nagainst downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions . So that is —in\na sense, that is a risk -management point, and that is a bit of insurance . But we also feel like\nweak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S . economy . You see it\n\nnow in the second quarter : You see weak investment , you see weak manufacturing —so support\ndemand there and also to support return of inflation to 2 percent . But there ’s definitely an\ninsurance aspect of it .\nTrade is unusual . We don ’t—you know, the thing is, there isn’ t a lot of experience in\nresponding to global trade tensions . So it is a —it’ s something that we haven’ t faced before and\nthat we ’re learning by doing . And it is not —it’ s not exactly the same as watching global growth ,\nwhere you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal\npolicy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle . With trade tensions —\nwhich do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the\neconomy —they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them .\nAnd, by the way, I want to be clear here. We play no role whatsoever in assessing or\nevaluating trade policies other than as —as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S .\neconomy in the short and medium te rm. We ’re not in any way criticizing trade policy . That ’s\nreally not our job.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Thank you. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . So, Chair\nPowell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates : a lower neutral rate that\nmay have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker\nrisk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re -center inflation and inflation\nexpectations . I wonder, which of those fac tors, if any, weighs most heavily on you? A nd, more\nimportantly, is a ¼ point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I actually think different people have different —different\nweightings has been my experien ce on those things . You mentioned lower r* , trade slowdown—\nand I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which\n\nkind of point to more accommodation. So, again, I don ’t think asking about a ¼ point is really\nthe ri ght question. I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the\nCommittee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to , now , a rate cut .\nSo I think we ’ve been providing —and that a ffects the forward rate path, and it affects\nfinancial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy . You see an economy which is\nactually performing pretty well . Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was\nin all of ’ 18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019 —at the end of 2019.\nSo I think, in a way , that ’s monetary policy working . And , again, I wouldn ’t just look at the\n25 basis point cut as the right question.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . If I could follow up, I guess in May —in May it seemed as if you\nwere setting a higher bar to cut rates : There would need to be a deterioration i n the outlook. In\nJune, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn’ t improve, there might be a rate cut . Where\nis that bar right now , because I think there ’s some co nfusion about how the C ommittee is\nresponding.\nCHAIR POWELL . Ye s. So we, as we noted —we noted at the bottom of the statement\nthat language, which really says how we ’re thinking about it . So it says , as we’re contemplating\nthe future path of the target r ange for the federal funds rate, we ’ll continue to monitor the\nimplications of incoming information —and it talks about that language . So, you know, I can ’t—\nall I can tell you is, we ’ll be looking at weak global growth. We ’ll be looking very carefully to\nsee how that ’s happening.\nAnd I think you see —you learn —every cycle you learn about these things . So we will\nsee whether growth is picking up, whether it ’s bottoming out . We ’ll see that picture . We ’ll also\nsee on trade. Y ou know, we ’re going to be seeing —I think we ’ve learned a lot on trade in this\n\ncycle . I think we ’ll continue to learn more , and on inflation we will . So, in addition, the U.S .\neconomy itself is —the performance of the U.S . economy will enter into that . So I would love to\nbe more p recise, but with trade , it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way . Those\nare the things that we ’ll be looking at, and— you know, in making our decisions going forward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network. So a rate hike\nlast December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis F ed president, James Bullard, as a\nstep too far. Now the F ed’s waited about seven months for a rate cut . You said today you were\nconcerned about downside risks . So could some of the weakn ess on the business side , with that\nfixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side , be because the F ed waited so long ? I\nwant to get your thoughts on that and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level.\nCHAIR POWELL . Ye s. So we don’ t hear that from businesses . They don’ t come in and\nsay, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.” I haven ’t heard\nthat from a business . What you hear is that demand is weak for their products . You see\nmanufacturing being weak all over the world. Investment —business investment is weak. A nd I\nwouldn’ t lay all of that at the door of trade talks . I think there ’s a—there’s a global business\ncycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that ’s—tha t’s been, you know,\ndefinitely a bigger factor than , certainly , we expected late last year . I think global —global\ngrowth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent .\nAnd, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we\nantic ipated.\nIn terms of , is this the —we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’ s—we\nthink it will serve the three ends that I mentioned . And I ’ve already gone over how we ’re\nthinking about going forward.\n\nANN SAPHIR . Ann Saphir with Reuters. You called it “ a midcycle adjustment to\npolicy .” And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send\nwith this move today about future rate moves?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, the sense of that is —I mean , that refers back to other times\nwhen the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle . And I’m contrasting it there with the\nbeginning —for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.\nANN SAPHIR . So we’re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle?\nCHAIR POWELL . That is not —that ’s not what we ’re seeing now . That ’s not our\nperspective now or outlook.\nJAMES POLITI . Hi there . Are there any circumstances under which you would decide\nto pause —pause at one interest rate cut, today ’s interest rate cut , and not —not , not go ahead with\nfurther monetary easing at this stage ? Or are you predicting that, you know, once you’ ve\nembarked on this easing , you will have to at least move by one more notch going f orward?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so our policy is —will depend on the implications of\nincoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook. A nd so we ’re\ngoing to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the out look, as I mentioned.\nAnd, s o I—that ’s really where I would leave you with that.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi . Victoria Guida with Politico . On capital, Vice Chairman\nQuarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exist s right now are such that it’ s\nbasically like the counter cyclical capital buffer is already turned on , and that he would like the\nability to be able to turn it down in a downturn. I was wondering if you agreed with that .\n\nAnd then, also, just quickly , on real -time payments —larger banks have suggested that if\nthe F ed built its own system , that would be a bait -and-switch , because the F ed asked —or called\nfor a private -sector system . Do you think that that is a fair assessment?\nCHAIR POWELL . Okay . So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital\nrequirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right . I do agree with that .\nThe idea that you ’re talking about is one that ’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about . It’s\na—it’s one under consideration. The idea being , in a sense , we’ve chosen, in the United States,\nto have high through -the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the\nsurcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirem ents. We ’ve, in effect , already put\nin place substantial countercyclical buffers . And so, conceptually , you can think of —I’m not\nsaying it’ s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer .\nSo that ’s—that’s really the point —is that we don’ t rely —our s ystem doesn ’t rely on our\nability —it doesn’ t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a\ncountercyclical tool . We rely on through- the-cycle, always -on high capital and liquidity\nrequirements . And I think that ’s a good thing to do. The idea of putting it in place so you can\ncut it, that’ s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it ’s worth considering . I think\nthe United Kingdom , in particular , has a countercyclical capital buffer that’ s always on , but the\none point of it is that you can cut when there ’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more\nroom . So this isn ’t something we ’ve decided to do. It’s just under consideration.\nIn terms of the real -time payment system, your second question, so this is something\nwe—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real -time payments\navailable to the general public. The F ed, really, coming out of the Reserve System —the Reserve\nBanks and the Board together —convened all of the stakeh olders around the table to talk about\n\nhow we can move forward. This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card\ncompanies —pretty much all of the groups who would be interested—and worked on a project for\nseveral years . And one of the things tha t came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed\nshould build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that\nproblem .\nWe put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we\ngot quite a lot of comments . They were overwhelmingly favorable . And I would point out that\nin our payment system, in many places, the F ed operates alongside private -sector operators —for\nexample, in wholesale payments , in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’ t be unusual or out of\nkeeping with —with how we ’ve done things in the past . We have not made a decision on this,\nbut it ’s something we ’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we ’ll make a decision\non soon.\nCRAIG TORRES . Craig Torres from Bloomberg . I’m trying to parse what you ’re\nsaying here . On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial\nconditions , and that ’s helping the economy . In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this\nlanguage , “will act as appropriate ,” as still being in the statement. And , on the other hand, you\nsay it ’s not the start of a —of an easing cycle. So what are you saying? Does that mean, you\nknow, with one or two more cuts you’ ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement ?\nOr simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants\nthink?\nCHAIR POWELL . So it is —as I mentioned, it ’s going to depend on the evolving data\nand the evolving risk picture . But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we\nsee is that it’ s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative\n\nstance. That ’s what we ’re seeing . And that ’s what we ’re going to be looking —you know, we ’ll\nbe looking at incoming data, at all of the —at the risks that I mentioned , and the performance of\nthe U.S . economy , and at low inflation . We’ll be looking at that to make our decisions going\nforward.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr . Chairman . Scott Horsley for NPR . You ’ve talked\na number of times about the people who feel like they are just rece ntly getting to the punchbowl\n10 years into this expansion. Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to\nhelp them?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I think the best thing for people who are —who a re feeling\nthat—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low - and moderate -\nincome communities to the effect that they ’re now feeling the recovery , and, in fact , they haven’ t\nfelt a better labor market in anybody ’s memory , so this is great to hear . And I guess my view is ,\nthe best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that ’s one\nof the overarching goals of —of this move and all of our policy moves . There really is no reason\nwhy the expan sion can ’t keep going . Inflation is not troublingly high. If you look at the —at the\nU.S. economy right now, there ’s no sector that ’s booming and therefore might bust . You have a\nfairly well -balanced, in a sense, economy .\nNow, the engine , though, is real ly a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the\neconomy . The manufacturing economy —the investment and manufacturing part of the\neconomy —is more or less not —not growing much . It’s at a healthy level but not growing much .\nSo—and we hope to help that with this rate cut. But, I would say , overall , we’re trying to sustain\nthe expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum\nemployment and stable prices.\n\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell , Donna Borak with CNN. The President has\nrepeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet. What do\nyou say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today? And could you\nalso elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decide d to speed up its balance sheet runoff two\nmonths earlier today?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I gave my —my reasons for —our reasons , really —for doing this .\nAnd, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to i nsure against downside\nrisks to the out look from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that\nthose factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent. That’s\nwhat we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our pol icy in the\ndirection of more accommodation. I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to\nthat. So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it.\nWe never take into account political considerations. There’s no place in our discuss ions\nfor that. We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence. We\nconduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and\nthat’s what we’re always going to do. We’re always going to use our tools that way . And then,\nat the end, we’ll —you know, we’ll live with the results.\nIn terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency.\nReally nothing more to it than that.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. G reg Robb from MarketWatch. I was\nwondering —we weren’t in the room, but I think it’s a fair assumption to know that the two\ndissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns. So I was wondering if you could\ntalk about what you—what was your res ponse to them when those concerns were raised ? I’ve\n\ncollected a couple of things from the IMF , and the Bank of International Settlements said that it’s\njust—when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there’s also this\nfeeling that it makes it harder to raise rates. So could you talk about that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So, first , let me say —I’ll just speak for myself, but I\nunderstand those concerns very well. I do. I’ve —you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken\nabout them, and I take them very seriously. But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as\na reason not to take this action today. I just don’t think—that would be my point. And one of\nthe reasons why I think that is , if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability\nframework now for the first time. Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and\nwe publish it. And we look at , really , four big things so that we know we can— you know, the\npublic can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting , and—you know, and see\nwhether we got this right , because it’s transparent now.\nBut the four things we look at are valuation pressures . And we do see notable valuation\npressures in some markets but , you know, honestly , not at a highly troubling level. In terms of\nhousehold borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing . Households are in\na very good shape overall. I’ll come back to business borrowing. Leverage in the financial\nsystem is low, and funding risk is low. So, overall, staff’s view has been— and my view has\nbeen —that if you look overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate.\nThe place that gets all the attention right now —a lot of attention —is business borrowing,\nand we look very car efully at that. What’s happening with business borrowing is , the loans have\nmoved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market -based vehicles, which tend to be\nstably funded. B ut, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector c ould act as\nan amplifier to a downturn. So we’re watching that very carefully. But , again, I think if you\n\nlook overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience—much higher\nthan it was before the crisis —and that’s something to take comfort from. And I think all of that\ngives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and\nregulatory tools to —you know, to keep the financial system resilient.\nGREG ROBB. So you’re not doing something today f or—to help today, and then it’s\ngoing to cause problems down the road? Y ou’re not worried about that kind of dynamic?\nCHAIR POWELL. There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all. So, of\ncourse, of course, we monitor. We have—every quarter w e have an extensive briefing on\nfinancial stability, and we had that yesterday. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have a\ngreat team. We liaise with central banks around the world. You know, one of my colleagues is\nthe head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these\nthings all the time. And we worry about them all the time. We’re always looking at the —we’re\nlooking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time. But the things we haven’t\nmissed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking\nmonetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, AP. You’ve talked in this press\nconference about be ing data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of\nrate cuts. But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and\nthey’re predicting three, four cuts this year. Is this your effort to try to damp down that —that\nthing?\nCHAIR POWELL. No . Let me be clear. What I said was , it’s not —it’s not the\nbeginning of a long series of rate cuts. I didn’t —I didn’t say it ’s just one or anything like that.\nWhat I said is, when you think about rate -cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the\n\nCommittee is not seeing that—not seeing us in that place. You would do that if you saw real\neconomic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot. That’s not\nwhat we’re seeing. That’s not what we’re seeing.\nWhat we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to —to adjust policy to a somewhat more\naccommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking at it. What I said was , it’s not a\nlong cutting cycle —in other words , referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very\nsevere downturn. That’s —that’s really what I was ruling out. I think, if you look back at other\nmidcycle adjustments , you’l l see— you know, I don’t know that they’ll be , in the end,\ncomparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these.\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times . You mentioned the difficulty of assessing\ntrade tensions in the economic outlook. Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.–China\ntrade conflict was in the Fed’s decision to cut rates ? And if the current stalemate and the threat\nof more tariffs continue , what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any\none factor. I think we look at a broad range of factors , and trade uncertainty —trade policy\nuncertainty is one of them . That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t —I\nwouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that. And without knowing —you know, I\nthink we —with trade , we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be ,\nand so it’s hard to exactly say. Certainly, we’ve seen , though, that when there’s a s harp\nconfrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty\nquickly and on financial markets pretty quickly. We saw that in June . But then we saw them\nunwind after that , to some extent. You’ve seen it returning to —to a much lower temperature, I\n\nthink. Again, with—with trade policy, we’re just going to be watching and trying to assess the\nimplications for the —for the U.S. outlook.\nDON LEE. How much of an effect could the tariffs have?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small.\nThey’re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy. The real question is , what are the effects on\nthe economy through the —through the confidence channel —business confidence channel ? And ,\nagain, very, v ery hard to tease that out. I’ve seen some research, which —you know, which says\nthat they are meaningful —meaningful effects on —on output . That’s to say , not trivial. And I\nthink that that sounds right, but it’s quite hard to get —there is no way to get a n accurate measure.\nYou have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it’s a factor,\nparticularly businesses that have—manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross\ninternational borders will all tell you th at it’s been a challenge. Many of them have made\nadjustments, and they’ve gotten to a place where it’s okay, but it’s —it’s been a challenge.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires. Thanks for the question,\nChairman. As the press conference —as this press conference has gone under way, markets have\ndeclined . The Dow is down as much as 400 points. What I’m hearing is a reluctance to provide\nmore guidance around the future path of rates. And I’m wondering if that reflects a greater lack\nof consensus on the Committee . And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see\naround these decisions , and how split are people about this?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, you’re right. T here’s a range of views on the Committee,\nand—but the C ommittee is unifie d, completely unified on our dedication to making the best\npolicy decisions that we can make . And that means people have a responsibility to do their best\nthinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nIn terms of the way for ward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we\nlaid that out in the —you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that’s the roadmap we’re going\nto be following going forward. We’re going to be data dependent. We’re going to be, as we\nalways are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic\nexpansion.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker . So it’s been about\n18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement action against Wells Fargo. And I w as\nwondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the\nshortcomings that it had in its risk -management processes . And I’m also curious whether their\nlack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress , in your eyes .\nCHAIR POWELL. So the problems at Wells Fargo —that arose at Wells Fargo around\nrisk management and consumer —the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty\ndeep, and I think the company realizes that . And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t\nbeen fixed quickly , and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly. So they’re —you\nknow, they —they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to\nlift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now. And the Committee —I\nmean, the company is working away to address these issues, but , as I said, they’re deep -seated\nissues, and it just takes time to address them.\nI wouldn’t comment on the CEO question. I don’t really have anything for you on that.\nJOHN HELTMAN. I mean , I just —I’d like to clarify , like , are you pleased with the\nresponsiveness you’re getting from them? Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of\nwanted it to go?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going to characterize it. You know —I mean , I have\ncharacterized it. We have—we have an enforcement action in place. The company is working\naway at addressing it. They take it seriously. I think they do see it as we do, as something that\nhas to go deep . And, you know, we’ll lift the growth cap when w e’re satisfied.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. So when\nwe have our next recession, the Fed will have less room —it will happen —the Fed will have less\nroom to maneuver cutting interest rates since you’re cutting now. How bi g of a problem will\nthat be?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the premise is not —I will question your premise for a\nsecond. If you remember whether —again, one of the purposes of our —of our cut today is to\nsupport the expansion. A nd we don’t know when—and if it r eally works —if that works very\nwell and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the —where the funds,\nin other cycles —and I don’t know whether this will happen or not , but in other cycles , the Fed\nwound up raising rates again after a mi dcycle adjustment. Again, I’m not predicting that, but I\ndon’t think that we know that we won’t have —that we’ll have less ammo because of these\nthings. That’s one thing. So —\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. But you won’t be able to cut as much if —if rates are\nlow. I mean, you will have —have less ammo , in that sense.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that\nonce we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again. Just as a matter of principle, I\ndon’t think tha t’s right. In other —in other long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have\nsometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking —in fact , will cut—and\nthen will go back to hiking. Again, I don’t know whether that’ll happen right here. It doesn’t\n\nseem —it doesn’t seem like something that’s in—you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we\ndon’t know that.\nAnd the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle , you—you do have a lot of benefits\nfrom that . And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have . A couple of rate hikes one\nway or the other isn’t going to matter so much if there is a downturn. And you’re right, there\nwill eventually be one. We’ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time\ncomes.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with MNI. Can you give us an update on the ongoing\nreassessment of the inflation framework? And have the discussions so far this year had any\nbearing on today’s decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the monetary policy review is really for —it’s really there to look\nat the way we make policy in the longer run. It’s not something that enters directly into our\ndiscussions today. We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings , called Fed Listens , at\nalmost all the R eserve Banks. Soon it will be all the R eserve Banks. And we meet there with the\nconstituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people —not\njust—not just economists, but people who are not economists , how —how their lives interact\nwith the Fed’s wo rk. It’s been —it’s been great. I ’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I\nhoped it would be.\nWe’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re\ngoing to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you\nknow, the questions that we’re asking about our framework. So it’s very early to say where\nthat’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is\n\nand looking at how it’s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world\nduring the Global F inancial C risis. I expect we’ll be at this a while.\nI’m very excited about it. I think it’s been a good exercise. I think it’s opened us up to\nsunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise. And I think it’s a good time.\nYou know, you have —10 years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the\neconomy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are\nsome things that we can do to improve our framework.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Can you\ngive us a sense of whether the C ommittee feels constrained at all by the market’s expectations\nfor more cuts or other developments in financial markets?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think this was —this was well telegraphed. What we did today\nwas—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do. I had mentioned the\nreasons for it. They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think— you know, I think they will—they\nwill achieve their goals.\nWe do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that\nare consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this\nyear have really worked. Of course, we alw ays retain the flexibility to adjust our\ncommunications and our actions to —in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture ,\nbut—I’ll leave it there .\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Brian Che ung with Yahoo Finance. Just to expand on that point\nabout communication , I mean , we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with regards\nto New York Fed P resident John Williams’s remarks before the blackout period. So the Fed\nadded language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating the future path of\n\nthe target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications . I’m wondering—now\nthere’s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you’ve had\nto cut rates , outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a\nbaseline. So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the\nchallenges of communicating it.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye ah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one. And\nwe do —we have had these global , really, risks to the outlook. There really —there really is\nnothing in the U.S. economy that presents a —you know, a prominent near -term threat to the U.S.\neconomy. As I mentioned, there’s no—there’s no segment that ’s really —or sector that’s really\nboiling over and overheating. Nothing like that. It’s —it’s within —within the economy. It’s —\nit’s healthy , so I would say that. Downside risks are really coming from abroad. A nd, of course ,\nwe are concerned about —about low inflation. But —and , by the way, those risks from abroad are\naffecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment —fixed investment. S o—\nthank you."
