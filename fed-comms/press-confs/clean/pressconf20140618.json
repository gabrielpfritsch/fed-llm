  "text": "June 1 8, 2014\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its\nJune meeting earlier today. As was indicated in our policy statement, the Committee decided to\nmake another modest reduction in the pace of its purchases of longer -term securities. The\nCommittee maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.\nToday’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is\ncontinuing to make progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the l abor market, conditions have improved further. The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is\nfour-tenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U -6 measure— which\nincludes marginally attached workers and those working part time but prefer ring full -time\nwork —has fallen by a similar amount. Even given these declines, however, unemployment\nremains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant.\nAlthough real GDP decline d in the first quarter, this decline appears to have resulted\nmainly from transitory factors. Private domestic demand —that is, spending by domestic\nhouseholds and businesses —continued to expand in the first quarter, and the limited set of\nindicators of spending and production in the second quarter have picked up. The Committee thus\nbelieves that economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace thereafter. Overall, the Committee continues to see s ufficient underlying\nstrength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.\nInflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the\nCommittee remains mindful that inflation running persistently below its obje ctive could pose\n\nrisks to economic performance. Given that longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well\nanchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies\naround the world, the Committee continues to expect i nflation to move gradually back toward its\nobjective. The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum employment and\ninflation of 2 percent.\nThis outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction\nwith this meeting by the FOMC participants. As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own views of appropriate monetary policy. The central tendency of the\nunemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the March projections and now stands at 6.0 to 6.1 percent at the end of this year. From there, Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer -run normal level by the end of 2016. The central\ntendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 2.1 to 2.3 percent for 2014, down notably from the March projections, largely because of the unexpected contraction in the first quarter. Over the next two y ears, the projections for real GDP growth remain somewhat above the\nestimates of longer -run normal growth. Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation\nmoving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands. The central\ntendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.6 to 2 percent in\n2016.\nAs I noted at the outset, the Committee decided today to make another measured\nreduction in the pace of asset purchases. Starting next month, we will be p urchasing $35 billion\nof securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate. Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to expand our holdings of longer -term securities, and we\n\nwill also continue to roll over maturing Tre asury securities and reinvest principal payments from\nthe FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in agency\nmortgage -backed securities. These sizable and still -increasing holdings will continue to put\ndownward pressure on long er-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial\nconditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the\nCommittee’s objective.\nToday’s announced reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects the Committee’s\nexpectation that progress toward its economic objectives will continue. If incoming information\nbroadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the Committee will likely\ncontinue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings. However, as\nI have emphasized before, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions\nabout the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its\nassessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nLet me now turn to the framework we will be applying as we consider interest rate\npolicy. In determining how long to mai ntain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This broad assessment will not hinge on any one or two indicators, but will take into account a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. Based on its current assessment of these factors, the Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,\n\nespecially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run\ngoal, and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Further, once we begin to\nremove policy accommodation, it ’s the Committee’s current assessment that, even after\nemployment and inflation are nea r mandate- consistent levels, economic conditions may, for\nsome time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as\nnormal in the longer run.\nThis guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported i n the\nparticipants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values at the end of 2016. Although FOMC participants provide a\nnumber of explanations for the federal funds rate target remain ing below its longer -run normal\nlevel, many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis. These include restrained household spending, reduced credit availability, and diminished expectations for future growth in output\nand incomes, consistent with t he view that the potential growth rate of the economy may be\nlower for so me time.\nLet me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectation for the path of the federal\nfunds rate target is contingent on the economic outlook. If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged. Conversely, if economic performance disappoints, resulting in larger and more persistent deviations from the Committee’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to take place later and to be more gradual.\n\nBefore taking you r questions, I’d like to provide an update on the Committee’s ongoing\ndiscussions on the mechanics of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy. To be\nclear, these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy. Rather, they represent prudent planning on the part of the Committee and reflect the Committee’s intention to communicate its plans to the public well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate.\nThe Committee is co nfident that it has the tools it needs to raise short- term interest rates\nwhen it becomes appropriate to do so and to control the level of short -term interest rates\nthereafter, even though the Federal Reserve will continue to have a very large balance sheet for some time. The Committee’s recent discussions have centered on the appropriate mix of tools to employ during the normalization process and the associated implications for the degree of control over short -term interest rates, the functioning of the f ederal funds market, and the extent\nto which the Federal Reserve transacts with financial institutions outside the banking sector. The Committee is constructively working through the many issues related to normalization and will continue its discussions i n upcoming meetings, with the expectation of providing additional\ndetails later this year.\nThank you. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC . There is every reason to expect, Madam\nChair, that the PCE inflation rate, which is followed by the Fed, looks likely to exceed your 2016 consensus forecast next week . Does this suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on\ninflation? And what tolerance is there for higher inflation at the Federal Reserve? And if it’ s\nabove the 2 percent target, then how is that not kind of blowing through a target the same way\n\nyou blew through the 6½ percent unemployment target in that they become these soft targets?\nThanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, thanks for the question. So I think recent readings on, for\nexample, the CPI index have been a bit on the high side, but I think it’ s—the data that we ’re\nseeing is noisy. I think it’ s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in\nline with the C ommittee ’s expectati ons. The C ommittee, it h as expected a gradual return in\ninflation toward its 2 percent objective. And I think the recent evidence we have seen, abstracting from the noise, suggests that we are moving back gradually over time toward our 2 percent objectiv e, and I see things roughly in line with where we expected inflation to be. I think\nif you look at the SEP projections that were submitted this time, you see very little change in inflation projections of the C ommittee .\nSTEVE LIESMAN. What about the tolerance for higher inflation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, the C ommittee has emphasized that we have the 2 percent\nobjective for, as a longer -term matter , for PCE inflation and we would not willingly see a\nprolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective ,\nand that remains true. So that hasn ’t changed at all in terms of the C ommittee ’s tolerance for\npermanent deviations from our objective. And we continue to see the data coming in, abstracting from the noise , in line with what we had expected, and continue to see a gradual pickup over the\nnext several years toward our 2 percent objective.\nROBIN HARDING. Robi n Harding from the Financial Times . Madam Chair, could you\ncomment a little bit more on the decline in the long -run interest rate projection? Is that more to\ndo with temporary headwinds from the recovery or is it something more permanent about the\n\neconom y? And is this it, this decline to 3.75 percent ? Or do you think there ’s potential for this\nrate to go lower yet? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, you do see a very slight decline this time in the C ommittee ’s\nlonger -term normal rate of interest projections. You know, I would caution you, however, we’ve\nhad turnover in the C ommittee —two new participants who joined and are submitting projections\nand two who departed —and that can create changes in the projections , small changes that are\ndifficult to interpret. But I think it’ s fair to say there has been a slight decline. And I think, you\nknow, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my\nopening statement, of projec tions pertaining to longer -term growth, and typically estimates of the\nlonger -run normal federal funds rate or short -term interest rates would move in line with growth\nprojections.\nYLAN MUI. Hi , Ylan from the Washington Post . My question is sort of the f lip side of\nSteve’ s, and it’ s about your outlook for unemployment. Your predecessor has said that the Fed\nhas been consistently too pessimistic about the level of the unemployment rate, and today, you guys lowered your outlook again. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you see the unemployment rate evolving to meet your forecast? Why you believe the rate of decline will\nstart to level off? And what an unexpected drop might mean for the first rate hike.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, it’ s true that unemploym ent has declined by more than the\nCommittee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the C ommittee ’s projections,\nat least the central tendency for the unemployment rate. Now, first of all, I mean, the labor market , I think, has continued to broadly improve. We have seen continued job growth at a pace\nthat is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time. Over the last three\nmonths , for example, employment—payroll employment —has been rising around 230,000 jobs\n\nper month and we ’re running close to 200,000 over the last year. So, it’ s in no way surprising to\nsee a decline in the unemployment rate. That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a\nportion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perha ps not representing a diminution of slack\nin the labor market. We have seen labor force participation rate decline. And while I think most\nof us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force\nparticipation rate for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we’ve seen in the\nunemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation. Now, if that ’s correct, we may see that as the economy\npicks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let ’s call them\ndiscouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment. And as labor force\nparticipation begins to stabilize, the unemployment rate will come down less quickly. And I think for a number of people, that ’s a component of the forecast.\nYou asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance\nthat we ’ve given, our forward guidance , states that the timing of liftof f will depend on actual\nprogress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective. So, we ’re not\ngoing to look at any single indicator like the unemployment rate to assess how we ’re doing on\nmeeting our employment goal ; we will look at a broad range of indicators. That said, as I tried to\nemphasize in my opening statement, there is uncertainty about monetary policy. The appropriate path of policy, the timing in pace of interest rate increases, ought to and I believe will respond to unfolding economic developments. If those were to prove faster than the C ommittee expects, it\nwould be logical to expect a more rapid increase in the fed funds r ate. But the opposite also\nholds true. If we don ’t see the improvement that ’s projected in the baseline outlook, that the\n\nopposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be\nlater and more gradual.\nJON HILSENRAT H. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, some\nFed officials and some market commentators have noted that market conditions recently have\nlooked a little bit like they did last spring before a period of turbulence. Volatility is very low in\nstock and bond markets. Risk premiums are very low, and in particular, the market expectations\nfor interest rates, for short -term interest rates look below even the Fed’s own projections as laid\nout in your dot plot. I wanted to ask two questions related to that. One, what is your read on\nthese—on market activity , and are you at all concerned about a sense of complacency in\nmarkets? And , two, what is your view on market expectations for the rate hike cycle that the Fed\nhas laid out in its dot pl ot? Or, is the market where you think the Fed is on that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mean, I’d start by saying that volatility , both actual and\nexpected , in markets is at low levels. The FOMC has no target for what the right level of\nvolatility should be. But to the extent that low levels of volatility may induce risk -taking\nbehavior that , for example, entails excessive buildup in leverage or maturity extension, things\nthat can pose risks to financial stability later on, that is a concern to me and to the C ommittee . I\ndon’t know whether a number of reasons have been cited for what we ’re seeing in the\nmarketplace. I don’ t know if overconfidence or complacency is one of those reasons. But I\nguess I would say, it is important , as I emphasized in my opening statement , for market\nparticipants to recognize that there is uncertainty about what the path of interest rate s—short -\nterm rates —will be. And that ’s necessary because there’ s uncertainty about what the path of the\neconomy wi ll be. And I want to emphasize , as I have, that the FOMC will adjust policy to what\nit actually sees unfolding in the economy over time , and that necessarily gives rise to a certain\n\nlevel of uncertainty about what the path of rates will be. And it is imp ortant for market\nparticipants to factor that into their decisionmaking. You asked me about the dot plot —our\nforecast , or our projections , for the f ed funds rate —and you do see a range of disagreement\namong the participants there , so by the time you get t o 2016, there is a considerable range of\nopinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I’m talking about —that participants\ndo see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it’ s appropriate for them\nto adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the\neconomy will evolve over time. And around each of those dots, I think every participant who ’s\nfilling out that questionnaire has a considerable band of uncertainty around their own individual forecast.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times . You ’ve spoken about\nthe sense that the recession has done permanent damage to the economic output and you’ve\nreduced gradually over time your forecast of long -term growth . I am curious to know to what\nextent you think stronger monetary and/or fiscal policy could reverse those trends. Are we stuck with slower growth? Is there something that you can do about it? If so, what? If not, why?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well , I think pa rt of the reason that we are seeing slower growth in\npotential output may reflect the fact that capital investment has been very weak during the downturn in the long recovery that we ’re experiencing. So, a diminished contribution from\ncapital formation to growth does make a negative contribution to growth. And as the economy\npicks up, I certainly would hope to see that contribution restored. So, I think that ’s one of the\nfactors that ’s been operative. Of course, we ’ve had unusually long duration unemplo yment. A\nvery large fraction of those unemployed have been unemployed for more than six months. And there is the fear that those individuals find it harder to gain employment , that their attachment to\n\nthe labor force may diminish over time and the networ ks of contacts that are —they have that are\nhelpful in gaining employment can begin to erode over time. We could see what ’s known as\nhysteresis , where individuals , because they haven ’t had jobs for a long time, find themselves\npermanently outside the labor force. My hope would be that as —and my expectation is that as\nthe economy recovers, we will see some repair of that , that many of those individuals who were\nlong-term unemployed or those who are now counted as out of the labor force would take jobs if\nthe economy is stronger and would be drawn back in again, but it is conceivable that there is\nsome permanent damage there to them, to their own well -being, their family ’s well -being, and\nthe economy ’s potential.\nCRAIG TORRES. Thank you, Madam Chair. I believe you mentioned in your opening\nremarks tighter credit, and I’m wondering what you think of the possibility that the Federal\nReserve itself , with the regulations it has to impose unde r Dodd -Frank , is partly responsible for\nthat. And , second, the current trend toward litigation. I recently read something where just the\nthree largest banks in the U.S. have paid $51 billion dollars in fine s so far, and obviously, the\nnumber is rising. So, why would anybody loan to a near -prime borrower ? And, in fact, if you\nlook at and people below FICO of 700 are having worse credit experiences. So it probably isn ’t\nbecause, you know, unemployment’s declining. It’s probably because banks simply don ’t want\nto take the risk. So, as the nation’ s top bank regulator, what can you do to fix that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I first would start by saying that I really think it’ s essential in the\naftermath of this crisis to strengthen financial regulation and to make the financial system more robust and to reduce systemic risk. We can see what the costs of the financial crisis were and I don’t think any of us should want to see that repeated. So, I think the regulations that we ’ve put\n\nin place, most of which follow from Dodd- Frank, are highly appropriate to create a more robust\nfinancial system that will be a safer and sounder one for our economy going forward, and I think\nwe’re making progress on doing that. In putting regulations into place, we have tried to phase\nthem in, in a way that gives long enough lead times to make sure that in strengthening the financial system, we don ’t produce a credit crunch. A nd by and large, my own assessment is that\ncredit is broadly available in the economy, but there are some exceptions , and I would agree with\nmuch of what you said when it comes to mortgage credit. I think banks , at this point , are\nreluctant to lend to borrowers with lower FI CO scores. They mention in meetings with us\nconsistently their concerns about putback risk , and I think they are —it is difficult for any\nhomeowner who doesn ’t have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage. I think that is one of\nthe factors that is c ausing the housing recovery to be slow. It’s not the only one , but I would\nagree with that assessment. And of course, you know, there were a lot of practices in connection\nwith mortgage lending that really need ed to be changed, we don’t want to go back t o those days,\nbut it is important to clarify —for us to work to clarify the rules around mortgage lending to\ncreate an environment of greater certainty for lenders to be willing to extend mortgage credit.\nJASON LANGE. Good afternoon, Jason Lange with Reute rs. Chair Yellen, the Fed has\nslashed its growth projections for this year , and you’ve gone to pains to explain that there is\nuncertainty in the path of interest rates in the economy , and yet the Fed central tendency\nprojections for 2015 and 2016 remain quite strong. Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above -trend economic growth? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, when you say “ confident,” I suppos e the answer is “ no”\nbecause there is uncertainty, but I think there are many good reasons why we should see a period of sustained growth in excess of the economy ’s potential. We have a highly accommodative\n\nmonetary policy. We have diminishing fiscal dra g. We have easing credit conditions. We have\nhouseholds who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service\nthat debt, an improving job market. We have rising home prices and rising equity prices and an improving global economy , at least in my estimation. So I think all of those things ought to be\nworking to produce above -trend growth and I think that ’s what ’s reflected in the forecast. But ,\nnevertheless , as I said, of course there is uncertainty around that projection. Y ou know,\nnevertheless, the labor market has continued to improve, and over a number of years in which, admittedly , growth has come in at a disappointing level, we ’ve still seen the labor market\nbroadly improve , and I expect that to continue.\nSTEVEN BECKNE R. Steve Beckner with MNI, Madam Chair. You mentioned that\nthere were discussions of the mechanics of normalization, as you put it. I assume that that\ninvolved some review of the —it was the third anniversary of the June 2011 exit principles. I\nwonder if I could get you to elaborate . In particular, is the C ommittee reaching a consensus\nabout the reinvestment and rollover policies, the timing of discontinuing those policies ? And I’d\nbe interested in your personal view on that.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, reinvestment policy was included in our 2011 exit principles ,\nand it’ s one of the things that we are discussing and reconsidering. We have not yet reached —\nwe’ve made quite a lot of progress in our discussion, but we ’ve not yet reached conclusions\nabout that or other aspects of our package. There are a couple of things Chairman Bernanke\nindicated , in contrast to our 2011 principles , that we would be very unlikely to sell mortgage -\nback ed securities , and that remains the case. Broadly speaking, some of the principles that were\nincorporated in those —in that 2011 package, the notion that we fully expect our balance sheet to\nshrink considerably over time back toward more normal levels, toward levels that would be\n\nconsistent with efficiently conducting mo netary policy, that ’s still an expectation. I believe it’ s\nan expectation that eventually our portfolio will be —consist largely of T reasuries , eventually,\nbut the re are quite a number of details. We have a number —as you know , a number of tools that\nwe can deploy as we move to normalize policy : interest on excess reserves, our overnight RRP\nfacility, term repurchase agreements with the markets, our T erm D eposit F acility , and exactly\nhow to deploy that set of tools to meet our objective of raising short —the general level of short -\nterm rates when the time becomes appropriate, and how best to communicate to the public and to\nmarkets how we are conducting policy and what our objectives are. Those are things we ’re\ndiscussing and hope we will be able to come back with a full description, or let ’s think of it as a\nrevised set of exit principles , later this year.\nDONNA BORAK. Madam Chair, Donna Borak with American Banker . One of the\noutstanding reform issues on the plate of the Fed i s to handle the risk related to short -term\nwholesale funding. You ’ve been very supportive of this issue, but we ’ve really heard little\nprogress so far on where things stand. Can you please explain to us why it’ s taken so long to get\nthis proposal out? What are some of the aspects that the Fed is considering in their approach to\nhow they roll out this rule, and where we may be in that process? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I’m afraid that I can’t give you a detailed timetable for when we\nwill move forwar d with that rule. I’ve been supportive , Governor Tarullo and others have been\nsupportive , of taking some action to diminish the incentives for heavy reliance on short -term\nfunding. We still see that as one of the risks to the financial system that wasn ’t really addressed\nin the risk -based capital requirements that we put out or in the liquidity coverage ratio that ’s out\nfor proposal. Governor Tarullo has suggested one approach could be to impose a capital requirement that ’s related to reliance on wholes ale funding, and in my own past comments, I’ve\n\nbeen supportive, but I’m afraid at this point —and this remains very much on the table to take\nsome action to address this —it certainly remains on the table as an unfinished agenda item, but I\ndon’t have a detailed timetable for you.\nDONNA BORAK. Would it be at some point before the end of the year , at least? Can\nyou say that much?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’m not —I’m just not certain. I’m—I just don’ t have a detailed\ntimetable for you, I’m sorry.\nGREG IP. Madam Chair, Greg Ip of t he Economist . This is partly a follow -up to Steve\nLiesman ’s question. How would the C ommittee respond if inflation did temporarily move above\ntarget in the near term before you achieve full employment? Your colleague John Williams and\nthe IMF have both suggested that the C ommittee might consider allowing inflation to\ntemporarily overshoot because that might achieve a faster, larger improve ment in employment.\nSecond question is: Will financial stability considerations play a role in when and how fast the\nCommittee normalizes interest rates?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So with respect to the question of overshooting, let me start by saying\nthat inflation continues to run well below our objective, and we ’re still some ways away from\nmaximum employment. A nd for the moment, I don’ t see any tradeoff whatsoever in achieving\nour two objectives. They both call for the same policy —namely , a highly accommodative\nmonetary policy. So, at best, overshooting of inflation or the thought that we will reach our\ninflation objective before we have attained maximum employment, I suppose I would see , at\nmost , as a risk that we could face somewhere down the road. Symmetrically, it’ s also\nconceivably a risk that we would reach our maxim um employment objective before we ’ve\nactually attained our inflation objective. So there are different ways in which we could\n\nconceivably —or there could conceivably arise policy conflicts or tradeoff s somewhere down the\nroad.\nNow, quite some time ago, the FOMC adopted, and we reaffirmed just in January , a\nstatement on our longer -run goals and policy strategy . And what that statement said is that, first\nof all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate -\nconsistent l evels, it will always be the FOMC ’s policy to make sure that we get back to those\ntarget levels over the medium term. But a principle that ’s embodied in that statement is that the\nCommittee will follow a so -called balanced approach in deciding on its poli cies. And ,\nessentially, that means that when we see some conflict between achieving the two objectives ,\nthat we would consider in deciding on a policy just how far we are from achieving each of the\nobjectives . And if the distance from achieving an object ive is particularly large, it would be\nconsistent with a balanced approach that we would tolerate some movement in the opposite\ndirection on the other objective. But balanced approach is the general policy strategy I think we’d follow.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I’d like to\nask you about your signaling mechanism going forward. At this point you haven ’t decided on\nreinvestments. You ’ve told people , don’ t pay any attention to the dot plot, and your two\nmandates, inflation and unemployment, are backward- looking lagging indicators. So, if\nsomething should surprise in the economy with only four SEPs and press conferences a year, how do you signal to the markets what the Fed is doing so that you don’ t run the risk of an event\nlike last September when people were surprised, or some sort of credibility problem where people feel you’re falling behind the economy?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, you know, again, we are very attentive to unfolding economic\ndevelopments and understand that there can be surprises and twists and turns in the road, so that\nthe forecasts that we ’ve made become no longer appropriate and we need to respond to unfol ding\ndevelopments. I’m personally committed to communicating with the public whenever\ncommunication is appropriate. We have four press conferences, but I would feel it appropriate for me to either have additional communications meetings with the press or to give speeches or\nto, in a variety of opportunities I have , to make clear what the C ommittee ’s thinking is , and my\ncolleagues as well , I think, would feel it entirely appropriate to communicate changes —changes\nin our views.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Hi, I’m Pedr o da Costa from Dow Jones Newswires. Thank you\nvery much. Since we are currently having a World Cup, I thought it would be valid to ask a question about the world. And I’m surprised —a little surprised at the optimism of your forecast\ngiven some, you kno w, the darkening outlook overseas. You ’ve got conflict in the Ukraine,\nescalation of war in Iraq with implications for oil prices that potentially have global economic impact. You have —excuse me—a European recovery that ’s still fairly weak, and emerging\nmarkets that are slowing down sharply. Do you think the U.S. can be a lone engine of economic recovery globally? And if I could just follow up very quickly on Greg ’s question, because you\ntalked about the two sides of the mandate, but you didn’ t quite answer the financial stability part.\nDo you think—is financial stability currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative than it would like? And if not, when do you expect that to happen, if at all? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, let me —I’m sorry I didn’ t answer the last part of Greg ’s question\nand the last part of yours. Let me start there. With respect to financial stability, we monitor\n\npotential threats to financial stability very , very carefully, and we have spoken about some —I’ve\nspoken in recent congressional testimonies and speeches about some threats to financial stability\nthat are on our radar screen , that we are monitoring. Trends in leverage d lending and the\nunderwriting standards there, diminished risk spreads in lower -grade corporate bonds —high -\nyield bonds —have certainly caught our attention. There is some evidence of reach -for-yield\nbehavior. That ’s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very\nmuch on my radar screen and would be a conce rn to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or\nother kinds of risk- taking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for\nexample, jump in interest rates. And we ’ve seen what effect that can have on the global\neconomy, and I think i t’s something that it’ s important to avoid.\nBut broadly speaking, if the question is , to what extent is monetary policy , at this time ,\nbeing driven by financial stability concerns , I would say that —well, I would never take off the\ntable that monetary policy should—could, in some circumstances , respond. I don ’t see them\nshaping monetary policy in an important way right now. I don’ t see a broad -based increase in\nleverage, rapid increase in credit growth or maturity transformation, the kinds of broad tr ends\nthat would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level. And we are using supervisory tools and regulations both to make the financial system more robust and to pay particular attention to areas where we ’ve spotted concerns , like leveraged\nlending, which is very much a focus of our supervision.\nNow, let ’s see. There was a first part to your question, and the first part was about global\nrisks, and we always pay attention to global risks and the likely evol ution of the global economy.\nYou expressed a lot of pessimism about emerging markets, and I see it more likely that we ’ll see\nmoderate growth and a pickup there. Of course, there are geopolitical risks —the Middle East ,\n\ndevelopments in Iraq, of course. T hey’re not only a humanitarian concern; they are a concern\nwith respect , potentially , to energy supplies and prices, and so I would certainly list that as\nsomething in the category of risks to the outlook.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes with Fox Business, ma ’am. Can I —just to follow up a\nlittle bit on what Pedro asked about. Specifically, what about equity markets? I mean, right\nnow, today, the S&P 500 is on track to close at a —another record high. You have said that you\nhave not seen any evidence of bubbles in equity markets, and that they have been trading within historic norms. Is that still the case today? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I don’ t have a sense—the Committee doesn’ t try to gauge what is\nthe right level of equity prices. But we do certain ly monitor a number of different metrics that\ngive us a feeling for where valuations are relative to things like earnings or dividends, and look at where these metrics stand in comparison with previous history to get a sense of whether or not\nwe’re moving to valuation levels that are outside of historical norms, and I still don’ t see that. I\nstill don’ t see that for equity prices broadly.\nANNALYN KURTZ. Annalyn Kurtz with CNNMoney. Thank you, Chair Yellen. I’m\nwondering: What ’s the Fed ’s general expect ation for wage growth this year and next year? And\nif inflation outpaces wage growth, does that scenario make you more hesitant to raise the federal funds rate next year? Or if, conversely, wages rise just enough to keep up with inflation, they ’re\nmoving in lockstep, let ’s say, is that enough to satisfy what you’re looking for in the job market?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, thanks. That ’s a great question. You know, I see\ncompensation growth, broadly speaking , as having been very well contained. By most measures,\ncompensation growth is running around 2 percent. So that ’s real wage growth or real\ncompensation growth that ’s essentially flat rather than rising, and real wage growth really has\n\nnot been rising in line with productivity. My own expectation i s that as the labor market begins\nto tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where\ncompensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take -home pay. And within limits —well, that might be signs of a tighter\nlabor market. Within limits, it’ s not a threat to inflation because consistent with the level of\ninflation we have for our 2 percent inflation objective, we could see wages growing at a more rapid rate and—a somewhat more rapid rate—a nd, indeed, that would be part of my forecast of\nwhat we would see as the labor market picks up. If we were to fail to see that, frankly , I would\nworry about downside risk to consumer spending. So I think part of my confidence in the fact\nthat we ’ll see a pickup in growth relates to the fact that I think consumer spending will continue\nto grow at a healthy rate. And , in part, that ’s premised on some pickup in the rate of wage\ngrowth so that it’ s rising greater —more than inflation.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. Today ’s statement\nrepeated a phrase that ’s been used —that the C ommittee has been using , that there’ s likely to be a\n“considerable ” period between the end of the bond purchases and the first hike in the federal\nfunds rate. In March, you gave us some guidance to help—trying to help us to understand that\nby saying that that—it’ s hard to define, but it could mean six months. Is that a time frame that\nyou feel —still feel comfortable with? And , if you feel like it needs to be modified, do you—\ncould you give us an assessment of —the market seemed to expect a rate, the first rate hike in the\nsecond half of next year . Is that a good assessment?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So what I want to say, the guidance that I want to give you, is that\nthere is no mechanical formula whatsoever for what a “ considerable time ” means. The answer as\nto what it means is , it depends. It depends on how the economy progresses. The C ommittee said\n\nvery clearly in their s tatement that what they would be looking at and deciding on the timing of\ninterest rate increases would be the progress we ’re making in achieving our objectives, how far\nwe are from achieving our labor market objective and our inflation objective , and that we will be\nassessing that progress, and that ’s the key determinant of when interest rate increases are likely\nto come.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Next year?\nCHAIR YELLEN. There is no mechanical formula.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. The re was a report this\nweek , in a salmon -colored newspaper I won ’t mention , that the Fed is thinking about —and\nregulators in Washington are thinking about —an exit fee for bond mutual funds. This has\nsparked a lot of comments. Would you care to comment on t his?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I am not aware of any discussion of that topic inside the Federal\nReserve, and my understanding is that that is a matter that is under the purview of the SEC."
