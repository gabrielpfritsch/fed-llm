  "text": "CHAIR POWELL . Good afternoon, and welcome. At the FOMC meeting that\nconcluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the Uni ted States and\naround the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged.\nMy colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to\nsustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the\nAmerican people. Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with\nour expectations. Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we\nanticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker. Overall, the economy continues on a\nhealthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate.\nThe Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the\neconomy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and j ob growth,\nrising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment. Job gains rebounded in March a fter a\nweak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the\npace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. Although first -quarter GDP rose more\nthan most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed\ninvestment slowed. Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting\nour expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year.\nThe Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. For\nmuch of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside\nconsiderable slack in resource utilization. But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below\n4 percent, inflation moved up. From March through December, core inflation—which excludes\nvolatile food and energy components —was at or very close to 2 percent. Overall inflation\n\nfluctuated from a few ten ths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the\nmoves mostly due to changes in energy prices. As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of\nthis year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system. Overall inflation fo r the\n12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent. Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however,\nand as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months. We suspect that some\ntransitory factors may be at work. Thus, our baseline view remains t hat, with a strong job market\nand continued growth, inflation wil l return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric\naround our longer -term objective.\nAt the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook,\nincluding weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive\nBrexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations. While concerns remain in all of\nthese areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat. Global financ ial conditions have\neased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy\nand, in some cases , fiscal policy. Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement,\nand the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now. Further, there are reports of\nprogress in the trade talks between the United States and China. The Committee views these\ndevelopments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted\ninflation pressures , as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in\nmonetary policy.\nOver the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about\nour balance sheet. In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary pol icy using our\ncurrent policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves. In March, we\ndecided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff , starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely\n\nin September. These plans support our longer -run dual -mandate objectives and also provide\nclarity about the path of our asset holdings.\nToday we had a preliminary discussion about the longer -run maturity composition of the\nportfolio. Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter -term debt of the\nfederal government. In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer -term\nsecurities with the aim of lowering longer -term interest rates and, thus , supporting the recovery.\nBecause of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer -term securities. As part\nof normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term.\nThis choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.\nToday ’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and\ndiscussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the\nyear. There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately\nreach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for\nsmooth adjustment. As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet\nnormalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds.\n ly, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing\nmonetary policy : the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate. The change does not reflect\nany shift in the intended stance of monetary policy. We use the IOER rate to help keep the\nfederal funds rate in our target range. As balance sheet normalization continues, we have\nexpected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate.\nLast year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range\nafter the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range. These actions helped keep the\neffective federal funds rate well within the target range. And t oday we made one more such\n\nchange. The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy,\nand it remains unchanged.\nThank you very much . I will be glad to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chair . Steve Liesman, CNBC. As the statement\nnoted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent —it’s been falling for three straight months ,\nand while you’ ve been close, it ’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012. Mr.\nChair , I guess I wonder , is it time to address low inflation through policy , and can you give us\nsome sense of your metric for when it would be time? At what level would it require a policy\nresponse from the Committee?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation\nobjective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis. As I mentioned, we think our\npolicy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’ t see a strong case for moving in either\ndirection. I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation —actually ran\npretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.\nAs you point out, both headline and core , though, did come in on the soft side in the first\nquarter , and that was not expected as it relates to core. So we say in our S tatement of Longer -\nRun G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation\nwere running persistently above or below 2 percent. So “ persistent ” carries the sense of\nsomething that ’s not transient, something that will sustain over a per iod of time. And in this\ncase, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think\nthat some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient. And I ’d point to things\nlike portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things. In addition, the\n\ntrimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much. I ndeed, the Dallas trimmed mean\nis at 2 percent.\nBut to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent —inflation running persistently\nbelow, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we\nwould take into account in setting policy.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financi al Times. Let me\ncarry on on the same theme. There ’s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the\nprospects for a rate reduction this year. Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of\nthemselves on this? And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious\nconsideration of a rate cut? The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example —do you\nactually need to see a looming recession to cut rates , or could an insurance cut be appropriate?\nThanks.\nCHAIR P OWELL. So as I mentioned, we ’ve just come through a two- day meeting , and\nwe’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the\nworld and thought about our policy , and we do think our policy stance is appropriate r ight now.\nWe don’ t see a strong case for moving in either direction. So — w e do, of course , though—as a\nroutine matter , as you well know —we look not only at our baseline , but we also look at\nalternative simulations, both better and worse , and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy\nresponse would be . But that ’s all we do . And I would just say that we ’re comfortable —the\nCommittee is comfortable with our current policy stance.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Shifting gear s a little\nbit, I wondered if you could flesh out —I know you’ re describing it as a small technical\nadjustment , but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or\n\nnot this breaches the upper limit a little bit. Is there any f eed-throug h to broader credit\nconditions and financial conditions that you worry about , or is it simply a matter of the Fed\nshowing that it can control what it says it’ s controlling? And I do have a follow -up.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a small, temporary deviat ion outside of the range would really\ncarry no —wouldn’ t be important, as your question suggests. But we do think it ’s important that\nwe be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range. That ’s just\ngood monetary policy, good monetary control. So we think it ’s important , and we have the tools\nto do that , so we ’ve use d them again today . And, again, this is just a technical fix. It really has\nno implications for policy.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But a s a follow -up on this, it is demonstrating that you can\ncontrol the market you want to control. And I guess the question is , at what point would these\nsteady declines in the IOER —steady widening of this spread , if it continues , essentially become\nthe poli cy choice?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s, I mean —so , generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we\ncontrol only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate. And the transmission of\nthe federal funds rate into other short -term rates —money market rate s—has been very good over\na long period of time. And that ’s important , because it ’s really broader financial conditions that\nmatter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate. So I think the Fed controlling the federal\nfunds rate is actually important from that standpoint , and I don’ t see us not controlling it. So I\nthink we ’ll continue to control it , and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial\nconditions.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg. I’m curious about the financial\nconditions that you see out there. The minutes of the March meeting tell us “ a few ” officials\n\nworried about financial stability risks. Was there a broader discussion at this meeting? Any\nconsensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit ne w highs , and we do see some\ninstability in short- end trading —is it possible that rates are too low at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for\ncomment every other meeting. So we had our quarterly briefing today —yesterday, as a matter of\nfact—and had that discussion as well. And I think there haven’ t been a lot of changes since the\nlast meeting , but I ’ll just go through the way we think about it. First, we ’ve developed and\npublished our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities —put it out for comment\nand welcome any feedback that we get from the public. And that enables us to focus our\nassessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.\nSo there are four aspects of it that I ’ll go through quickly , but I ’d say that the headline\nreally is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding\nis that, overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are mod erate, on balance . And, in addition, I\nwould say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital\nand liquidity. But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices. And as for asset prices, some\nasset prices are somewhat elevated , but I would say not extremely so.\nLeverage in the financial sector —I mentioned households are actually in good shape\nfrom a leverage standpoint. Default rates are low. Borrowing is relatively low. Nonfinancial\ncorporates is an area that we’ ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns\nabout that —not so much from a financial stability standpoint , but from the standpoint that having\na highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.\n\nAnd then the last two —the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial\nsystem and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United\nStates. So , on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up on that —I’m just curious as to whether the\nlevel of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do say that risks to the financial system —we say in our\nlonger -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that\ncould prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration. I\nwould say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns a re better —capital\nliquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that. Those are better first -order\ntools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, did last year ’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its\n2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact , a ceiling? And, if so, would it be appropriate\nto lower rates if core inflation remained persistently closer to 1 ½ percent instead of 2 percent?\nAnd, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates , given the recent softness\nin core inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle\nof last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there. And the economy was\nquite strong and was growing strong. The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very\npositive way. And so I think the expectation was that inflat ion would remain up around\n2 percent. The weak first quarter performance was not expected —of core was not expected , and\nI don ’t think is related to anything we did , in terms of raising rates. It appears to be more —we\n\ndon’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight , but some of it\ndoes appear to be transient or idiosyncratic. Now, the second part of your question? Sorry.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower\nrates if co re infl ation held closer to 1½ percent? And, if not, are you worried that there is\nunwanted tightening from real rates , being where they are?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, I mean —so , as I said earlier, we do address this in our , sort of ,\nconstitutional document. If infl ation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently\nabove 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee , and the Committee would take that\ninto account in making policy. I do think it ’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably\n—for a sustained period of time —and symmetrically around 2 p ercent . Because if it doesn ’t,\nyou run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on\nthe downside —inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put\ndownward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us\nto, you know, support the economy in difficult times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. So as you just mentioned, las t\nyear when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this\nbenefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus. And you still have that to some extent, although the tax\ncuts have mostly fe eded through— we’ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending\ncap increases. So , I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward\nthe end of this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Inflation, first of all—month- to-month, quarter -to-quarter —is going\nto move around. Ther e will always be factors hitting it. So probably the biggest single factor\ndriving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation\n\nexpectations are anchored —the thought being , that ’s where inflation will go in the long run if it ’s\nnot been pushed by those other factors. So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the\neconomy does play some small role. It’s actually still a measurable role. It’s nothing like it was\nin the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that ’s also something that plays a role.\nAnd so we take all those things into account , and the part of it that we can control is the\nslack part. And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move\nback up. And if it isn ’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then\nthat’s something we ’d take into account in setting policy.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. Pivoting a little bit—\nabout wages, since 2010, women’ s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to\nmen’s, which have risen about 2.1. Do you think the relative increase in women’ s wages is a\nproblem for the U .S. economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think, generally, I ’d have to see the data on that. It\nsounds like you picked a particular time frame . Over time, I really wonder whether that ’s the\ncase. You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large.\nSo—\nDONNA BORAK. Just to push a little bit on this . But if the data shows that women ’s\nwages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U .S. economy if male’ s wages are declining or\nnot growing as fast as women ’s?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we ’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the\nFed indirectl y, and that ’s something I ’d rather avoid. It’s really not my role to engage with\npotential nominees to the F ed, so I ’m really not going to go there. I haven ’t seen this research\neither , so I don’ t really —really know. Thanks.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask —early last month, I\nbelieve it was April 2, the Fedwire ® system went down. A nd I was just wondering if you could\ntalk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether\nyou’re still looking into it, and whether it’ s something that could happen again.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So that ’s right. I want to say it was April 1 , but it may have\nbeen April 2. In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three - or fou r-hour\nrange. We were able to quickly identify the problem : It was an internal problem , and we were\nable to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat\nthemselves. So, you know, we learn from these instances . They ’re fairly rare , but we learn from\nthem , and in this case it was interna l, and it ’s been corrected.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Next month, we have the 10th\nanniversary of the end of the recession , and there are some countries that have had expansions\nfor 15, 20, 25 years. Do you think that ’s something that ’s practical for the U .S., that we could\nhave that kind of lengthy expansion? And for you personally, if we had a recession during your\ntenure, would you consider that a failure?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I wouldn’ t want to speculate. There ’s always the\nexample of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of , where I think they ’re in year 28 of their\nexpansion. So things are possible. All I c an see is that we have an economy where the\nexpansion is continuing. Growth is at a healthy level. The labor market is strong. We see job\ncreation. We see wages moving up. Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and\nwe do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent. So I see us on a good path\nfor this year.\n\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Do you see parallels with the 1990s , when —for example, some\npeople have pointed out, in the U .S., the longest expansion before this one , there was a rate cut in\n1995, and rates went up , and then they came down , and there was that kind of management. Do\nyou see similarities in today ’s situation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Similarities in the length. I mean, the situations were quite different\nthen. This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it’ s very interesting to\nlook at the history. I find it quite interesting to look at different periods. But I think, in our own\ncycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really wh at’s relevant for us now.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You ’ve\nrepeatedly said that the F ed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside\npolitical pressure , but it seems like the P resident is intent on in creasing that political pressure.\nYesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing.\nWhat do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey\nyour decisions to the public?\nCHAI R POWELL. Ye s, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that\nmeans we don ’t think about short -term political considerations, we don’ t discuss them, and we\ndon’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other. And what we ’re alw ays\nsolving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the\neconomic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.\nSo to give you an idea of what our process is like , maybe as a way of pu tting all that in\ncontext —so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive\npreparations : catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues\nand their staff. As you also are I ’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of\n\nbusinesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector\njust to get a better sense of the economy. We put all that together , and we come together for\ntwo days.\nThe first day begins with an economic briefing, which is , sort of , economic and financial\ndevelopments in the United States and around the world. That takes up most of the first day , and\nwe talk about this in great detail. We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the\nnext day we talk about monetary policy. And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous\ndecision , after an extensive discussion , that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is.\nAnd we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we ’re going to be patient as we\nconsider adjustments. And we also see, by the way, the evolving -risk picture as very consistent\nwith that outlook.\nSo we don’ t feel like the data ’s pushing us in either direction. Of course, we ’ll not\nhesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction. But that ’s our process.\nThat’s how we think about things. We don’ t think about other factors. We don’ t let them into\nour decisionmaking. We don’ t discuss them.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Paul Kiern an from Dow Jones Newswires. Thanks for the question.\nIn the l ast 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that\ncoincided with the housing bubble. I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry\nthat it will pr ove difficult for the F ed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset\nbubble of some sort. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s. So you’ re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years\ninflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to\nreach their inflation goals from below. And that includes us, although we ’ve actually done —\n\nwe’ve come closer, I think, than most others. And it ’s just a question, I think, of demographic\nand other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it\ncreates significant challenges. One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower —\nwill be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest\nrates. And that ’s one of the reasons we ’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies,\ntools, and communications this year —to think about that problem.\nYou mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower -for-longe r rates , and that is\nanother challenge. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the\nextent they threaten achievement of our goals , but we also view, and I do take the view that\nmacroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do\nright through the cycle —those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the\nfinancial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.\nGREG ROBB. Th ank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. This morning, the ISM\nmanufacturing i ndex fell to have its worst reading since October 2016. So isn’ t that a dark cloud\non your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year? I mean, how much weight does it\nhold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?\nCHAIR POWELL. This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning , on\nmanufacturing. Ye s, we see that reading as —it’ s still a positive reading and consistent with what\nwe expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.\nManufacturing has been weak all around the world. Services have been growing faster. So\nit’s—yes, it ’s something tha t we are watching carefully , but we do expect a positive contribution\nto growth from the manufacturing sector.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, Mr.\nChairman, for doing this. You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the\neconomy. You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with\nJapanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress. Could you talk\nabout a little bit of the domestic growth that you ’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year ?\nAnd could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy\none for the U .S. economy for growth for the rest of this year. A nd I would say that the basis for\nthat, really , is consumer spending and business investment. So if you look at consumer\nspending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March. A nd, as I\nmention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of\nconsumer spending —that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings,\nhigh levels of employment, wages going up. All those things are going to support consumer\nspending. So that ’s a significant part of the outlook this year. And business investment should\nalso be positive in that sort of direction.\nIn terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the\nuncertainty a round these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business\nsentiment. We have been hearing from our business contacts , really , a lot since the beginning of\nthe trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern. If you import metals or whatever for your\nproduct or export your product, then it ’s been a challenge for you. So that would be a positive.\nAnd, of course, most of the gains , though, I would expect, even from a successful trade\nnegotiation, would come in over time. You know, I don’t think—i t wouldn’ t be the kind of thing\nwhere you ’d immediately feel big effects right away , but they could be quite important over a\n\nlonger period. So that, I think—that would be my expectation. I don ’t know , though. I haven ’t\nseen—none of us, at least I haven ’t seen, the details of what ’s been negotiated.\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L .A. Times. Getting back to inflation, can you talk more\nabout the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think\nthose facto rs will pass?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. Well, I would just mention a couple. Let me say, I don ’t mean\nto diminish concerns about too- low inflation , but I think there ’s good reason to think that these\nreadings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.\nOne that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go\ndown when asset prices go down, with a lag. And so when asset prices went back up, probably\nthere’ ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution. Other ones that get mentioned are\nthings like apparel , and apparel prices were very, very low. There was a change in the\nmethodology. And another one is airfares. There are many little things. So we don’ t know\nuntil, again, until we see , but there ’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn\naround.\nAnd another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways ,\nlike—not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned. So trimmed\nmean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean\nmovements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn’ t go\ndown at all. It’s at 2 percent —or it’s at, I don’ t know whether it went down or was above that ,\nbut it ’s at 2 percent now. So there ’s reason to think that these will be transient.\nWe, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case. I would point\nto the case of cell phone services. Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a\n\nvery low reading for cell phone services —mobile phone services —and it was kind of a price\nwar, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that\nwould be repeated. And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we\nhad those months of 2 percent inflation.\nSo, again, we’ ll have to see here. We ’re going to be watching —really, I ’d like to say\nwe’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I ’ll end\nby saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Just following up, Chair Powell . Nancy Marshall -\nGenzer with Marketplace. You were saying if inflation does stay low and these low inflation\nrates are not transient, you said a couple times you ’ll take that into account with monetary policy.\nHow, specifically, will you take that into account?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s, it’s hard to say , because there’ s so many other variable s.\nUltimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time , but that ’s part of\nour mandate. Stable prices is half of our mandate , and we ’ve defined that as 2 percent . So we\nwoul d be concerned, and we’ d take it into account.\nNAN CY MARSHALL -GENZER. So a cut in interest rates would be possible?\nCHAIR POWELL. I can ’t really be any more specific than what I ’ve said.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do\nyou see room for another IOER adjustment? And then, can you speak to any other strategies or\ntools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short -term interest rates? There have been\nother ideas floated , like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate.\n\nCHA IR POWELL. If we need to , and as needed , we will use our tools to keep the\nfederal funds rate somewhere in the target range. We’ll do that. Don ’t expect to need to do it\nagain , but we don’ t know.\nI mean, we’re —with—the balance sheet is now —the size of it is going to be driven by\ndemand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned. And we ’re right at that point where\nwe’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next\nfew months. And so I—there is no template for this. There’ s no roadmap. We just have to do it ,\nand that ’s why we ’re moving so very gradually. It’s why we tapered the roll -off to only\n$15 billion in T reasuries per month. Effective, I guess, today, we ’re cutting the roll- off rate for\nTreasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here. So that ’s that.\nIn terms of other tools, we ’re actually —I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be\nlooking at the idea of a repo facility. I don’ t have any presu pposition that it ’s something we\nwould do, but we ’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox. Again, I wouldn’ t\nsay—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think\ncarefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then\ngo away and think about it for a little while. And then probably come back and make a decision.\nBut that ’s something we ’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine.\nHANNAH LANG. Hannah Lang, American Banker. On the regulatory side, the F ed and\nother bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling a proposal to revise the\nVolcker r ule. Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution\nand what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or\nmaking changes to the original proposal?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know , we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we\ngot a lot of comments , and we’ re reviewing them carefully. I really don ’t have a lot for you. I\nknow they ’re making good progress. I don’ t really have a date though. And in terms of what all\nit’s going to be, it ’s not something I can say with any certainty yet.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. So given what you ’ve\nsaid about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps\nbouncing back in the next GDP reading, I ’m wondering if you think that continued growth in\neconomic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another\noverheating. For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019\nwas 2.1, so I ’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see\nstrong GDP numbers.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we don’ t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing.\nWe see inflation below 2 percent now —as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last\nyear. So, really, no signs of overheating.\nIf you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of\nlabor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing. Nonetheless, you\nhave very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate , given\ninflation and given productivity , but not at all signaling any overheating at all. It’s not higher\nthan that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity . So, really not seeing signs\nof overheating at the moment.\nHEATHER LONG. Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?\nCan you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the\nCommittee views productivity growth, if it’ s accelerating enough?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Ye s—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved\nup pretty steadily over the last five years and are now —wages and ben efits are now b etween\n3 and 3½ percent. Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for\npeople at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing.\nYou mentioned productivity. So productivity is really very difficult to predict. No one\nhas been able to predict it successfully, so I won’ t really try. But I will say this : Productivity\nwas very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years. Last year, we had 1.9 percent\nproductivity, which is much higher. I don ’t know if that level can be sustained , but we really —\nit’s driven, to some extent , by technological developments and, really , the diffusion of\ntechnology through the economy , and it ’s very hard to predict. So I think it ’s positive.\nIn fact, I’ll mention, if we ’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation.\nReally , there has been a significant positive supply -side development over the last year and a half\nbetween the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also\nproductivity. And that does suggest more room to grow. It suggests that a less tight economy , a\nless, you know —may be part of the explanation for lower inflatio n.\nThanks very much."
