I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be\nhappy to respond to your questions.\nThe job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears\nto be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal. As you already know, we decided\ntoday to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to\n1¾ percent.1 This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back\nmonetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now.\nJob gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace\nneeded in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force. The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher. Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged. That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong.\nAlthough the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have\nmoderat ed early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals\nunderpinning demand remain solid. Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. Several factors are supporting the outlook: F iscal policy has become more stimulative,\nongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.\n\n1 Chairman Powell intended to say that the Committee had raised the target “range” for the federal funds rate.\n\nPage Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.\nOverall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nincreased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in January. The core price index, which excludes\nthe prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of futur e inflation, rose\n1.5 percent over the same period. However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of\ninflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly\na year ago. In coming months, as those earl ier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation\nshould move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term. Of\ncourse, various forces will continue to affect inflation. A t times it may be above 2 percent, just\nas at times it may be below. Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying\nto prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.\nBased on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the\nmedian project ion for the growth of inflation- adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent\nnext year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer -run rate. The median\nprojection for unemployment —for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the f ourth\nquarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point\nbelow the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate. Finally, the median inflation projection\nis 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020. Compared with the\nprojections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower,\nand inflation is slightly higher.\nAs I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the\nprocess of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion\n\nPage continues. This gradual process has been under way for more than two years , and it has\nserved —and should continue to serve —the economy well.\nIn making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for\ninflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market. In the\nCommittee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these\ngoals. By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need\nto tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion. At the same\ntime, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our objective, which could leave us\nwith less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future.\nParticipants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our\ngradual approach. The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of\nthis year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020. By 2020, the\nmedian federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer -run trend. Most participants\nrevised up their projections since Decembe r, although the median projection for this year did not\nchange. The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December.\nOf course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead\nrelative to our maximum employment and p rice stability objectives. If the outlook changes, we\nwill adjust monetary policy appropriately.\nFinally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in\nOctober, is proceeding smoothly. Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the\noutlook, we do not intend to alter this program. As we’ve said, changing the target range for the\nfederal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. As always,\nthe Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions\n\nPage were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing\nthe federal funds rate.\nThank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman —rig ht, the microphone. Mr. Chairman, welcome.\nInteresting changes in the forecast. A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run,\nlower unemployment seven -tenths below the long run, a nd yet very little change in inflation.\nWhat does that say ab out what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic ? And\nhow is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year —and I sense there’ll be three\nnext year —and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet? Where's\nyour biggest concern here? Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned\nand as you—as was in your question. The Committee ’s estimates of growth went u p, the\nCommittee ’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in\ninflation. And I think that reflects, essentially —if you think back to the era after the crisis,\nunemployment was 10 percent. It’s now 4.1 percent. You ’ve only seen very gradual upward\npressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase. And that suggests that the\nrelationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight. But, it has diminished, but it ’s\nstill there. So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects\nthe, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here —is it doing too\nmuch, doing too little?\nCHAIRMAN POWEL L. You know, I think we ’re trying to, we ’re trying to be, to take\nthe middle ground there. So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too\n\nPage long, and then we have to raise rates quickly , and that foreshortens the expansion. We don’ t\nwant to do that. The —on the other side, if we —if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then,\nreally doesn ’t get sustainably up to 2 percent , and, that will hurt us going forward. We need that,\nand it ’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expecta tions are anchored at 2 percent .\nSo we ’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the\nmiddle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the\neconomy is broadly on this path.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair\nPowell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as\npreventing persistent deviations. I want to understand what symmetry means in the context of\ninflation b eing allowed to run above the 2 percent target now that that ’s part of the projection\nfor—at least for core PCE next year. How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of\nthe past five years? Would the Fed be willing to a ccept the type of overshoot of its target as it\nhas seen during the undershoot? And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target\nthat is symmetric? Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾ ? And also, for how long?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, so as you noted, the —what we ’ve said in the\nlonger -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with\nsustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below. We ’ve also said —in\nminutes and in speeches and things like that —that that is a symmetric objective. So, that ’s how\nwe think of it. And, I think it ’s—I wouldn’ t characterize what we ’ve done over the last five\nyears as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation. We were always pushing toward\n2 percent , and I think that is how we look at it. I can ’t give you an exact number. It just, you\nknow, it, we haven ’t agreed on that. It just is that we ’re always going to be seeking 2 percent\n\nPage inflation. And in doing that, we ’re going to be considering, by the way , the other side of the\nmandate. You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from —\nunemployment from its goal. And —and also , just the duration of it as well.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Time s. Even\nwith the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to\n2.7 percent, and then—this year —and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020. Is the\ncontinued talk in Washington about tax cuts bring ing growth to 3 per cent or higher on a\nsustained basis overselling their potential impact?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, let me say what that really is. So the Summary of\nEconomic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts. The C ommittee\nmade really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints. The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written\ndown. And, you ’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent . I would—and that ’s an interesting\nstatistic . I would also say that the central tendency is interesting. The full range is interesting.\nSo you have a range of views around the table. One of the great benefits of our system is that we\ndo have R eserve Banks with their own s taffs and Governors with different views , and so we\ndiscuss these things. So the C ommittee doesn ’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you ’re going\nto have a range of views. That ’s really all I can say —2.7 just happens to be the median for ’ 18,\nbut it doe sn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say it ’s hard to say, but it would take —you\nknow, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth. It\n\nPage would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to\nget there.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg New s. So obviously you\nguys reduced your NAIRU estimate s slightly today, but if you continue to see job gains around\n200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know,\nmoderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether y ou’re\nactually overshooting full employment? And, if you start to question that, how is that going to\nimpact policy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So I guess I ’d start by saying that the natural rate of\nunemployment is not something that we can observe directly. We look at a wide range of\nindicators on that —you know, 15 or 20 of them at least . And also, I think we all understand that\nany point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands . So as the —as the actual\nunemployment rate has declined from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee ’s median\nestimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point. So the\nCommittee —and , I think, people —are generally influenced by data. As they see unemployment\ngoing lower, they ’re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation\nand price inflation. So I don’ t think we, we —we ’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we ’ll\nbe looking at that. So, as —if inflation —if unemployment does continue to go down, we ’ll\ncontinue to do that. As I mentioned earlier, there is no —there’ s no sense in the data that we ’re\non the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price\ninflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that. We’ll be alert to that. I guess the idea —the\ntheory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained\n\nPage period, you would see an acceleration of inflation. So we would know that then, a nd we ’re very\nalert to it, but it’ s not something we observe at the present.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from Financial Times. You and\nother policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently. Does that imply\nthat you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how\nwould you assess the implications for monetary policy? And s econd question—this is obviously\nyour first press conference, so it ’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this\nmore ofte n? Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Longer -run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural\nrate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow -\nmoving forces over time. So they don’ t—they don’t move around very much. So I wouldn’ t\nexpect the Committee ’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to\nmove quickly. They ’ll move slowly. So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would\nmove up because of, for example, greater fiscal expan sion? There’ s literature that says that.\nThere’s —there are reasons that that might be the case. In fact, it did tick up one -tenth , as you all\nknow, in the —in the median at this time. But it’ s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee\nsees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up\nand is open to the possibility that it will.\nSAM FLEMING. And p ress conferences ?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Ah, press conferences. So that ’s something that I ’m go ing to\nbe carefully considering. I have not made a decision about it. My colleagues and I are\ncommitted to communicating as clearly as possible about what we ’re doing and why we ’re doing\nit. I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more\n\nPage frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy. And so, it is something that I ’ll be\nthinking about.\nADAM SHAPIRO. Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network . You brought up the\nfiscal stimulus and the impact it’ s having, and I was curious , how is the change in the federal\nbudget deficit —because the stimulus is coming with great debt —has it changed your approach to\nhow many securities you ’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of\nTreasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll -off, given how\nmuch the U.S. government ’s going to have to borrow going forward? And, then a second\nquestion, things beyond your control —the President is expected to announce new tariffs against\nChina, and does the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to\ninflation ? And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in terms of the balance sheet, we ’ve said that , you know,\nwe carefully developed this plan . We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year. We\nannounced it, and we said we wouldn’ t change it , really , unless there were a significant downturn\nthat required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates. And I have no inclination to\nrevisit that. We ’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our\npolicy.\nSo, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring\nup the is sue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that , it was, first, that there ’s\nno thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.\nSecond thing is, I would say , is that a number of participants rep orted in —about their\nconversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has\nbecome a concern going forward for that group.\n\nPage MART IN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. You talked\nabout the fact that th e Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the\nmembers of the FOMC. Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that\nwas impacted by the—we had a $1½ trillion tax cut, w e’ve had $300 billion in increased\ngovernment spending —the staff forecast that you ’re working with, are those reflected —how\nwere they impacted by that? And how did that impact the discussions?\nCHAIRIMAN POWELL. So w e look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts —and ,\nby the way, the re are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their\nown work—w e look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers. So —and it ’s really\nthe policymakers ’ views that we talk about in the SEP . We don’ t—we do n’t, you know, talk\nabout the staff forecast. It’s a particular thing under —done under particular rules and\ncircumstances . And, really, it ’s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their\nforecasts , which are what drive policy.\nMART IN CRUTSINGER. That had no impact, though? It’s s uch a—that ’s a major\nincrease in government stimulus that you ’re—that had to have had an impact on the discussions,\nI would think, though.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Well , the—you’re right. So fiscal stimulus is a, y ou know, a\nmeaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of\nlast year and this year. And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of\nestimates, a range of literature, and did their ow n thinking and came up with their own estimates\nand submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections —as their projections. Those are\nnot the staff ’s projections. Those are our projections.\n\nPage HEATHER LONG. Heather Long, Washington Post . I—what wil l it take to get to four\nrate hikes this year? It ’s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be\nappropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back. Is it\nconcerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect? Is it just that people want\nto wait and see a little longer before they raise? Can you give us some more insight into why\npeople didn’ t go to four this time —the media n—even though the economic projections look very\nhealthy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one\ndecision at this meeting , and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nThe projections are really just individual projections t hat ar e submitted and then compiled. And,\nyou know, you ’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close , but,\nyou know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they ’ll\nchange depending on the way the outlook for th e economy changes. So that ’s really all I can\nsay. It could change up. It could change down. I wouldn’ t want to —for now, these are the best\nforecasts that people could make , and, you know, it could be that if the economy ’s a little bit\nstronger or a li ttle bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual.\nHEATHER LONG. So it wasn ’t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the\ndiscussion ?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Not, no .\nJIM TANKERSLEY. Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a\nproductivity question. On trade, what would have to happen in policy —and, in particular , in\npotential retaliation from countries around the world—for trade policy to become a concern for\nthe Committee ’s outlook? And then, the second question is , you mentioned productivity growth\n\nPage earlier. What ’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in\npolicy —any policy change in recent months changed that assessment?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC\nparticipants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns , which were relatively new ,\nabout —about future trade actions, really. And they ’re seeing it as a risk -to-the-outlook kind of\nthing. So —and the kind of thi ngs people are talking about would be, you know, more\nwidespread retaliation and more widespread actions back -and-forth kind of thing. I can ’t be any\nmore specific than that.\nIn terms of productivity —productivity, as I ’m sure you know, has been very weak since\nthe financial crisis. It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years , I guess. So\nthat’s well below, you know, longer -run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it\nmove up. It has moved up just a little bit but not , kind of , decisively.\nAnd, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity. I\nthink in the tax bill there’s —there are incentives for —there— a tax cut bill that allows expensing\nof investments should encourage additional i nvestment that should encourage productivity. In\ntheory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force\nparticipation. So I do think it ’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the\ncountry. It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed , but, you know, we ’re certainly\nhopeful that there will be supply -side effects like that from the tax bill. I think estimates are\nreally all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.\nJONATHAN SPICE R. Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters. I take your\ncaveats on the dot plot , as it were, but I ’ll ask another question. In 2020, it shows that\npolicymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3½ percent , which is quite a ways —or,\n\nPage defini tively , anyways —above the neutral rate. Does that increase the risk of a Fed -induced\nrecession and decrease the risk of a soft landing? Which is asking , in a way , about the fiscal\npolicy . And, as a follow -up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the F ed\naround this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of “ low rates ”\nenvironment? Thanks.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say that —remember that forecasts three\nyears out —so, you’ re righ t, in 2020 there ’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP\ndots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would\ncharacterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that’ s three years\nin the future. It’s highly uncertain. You know, we don’ t have the ability to see that far into the\nfuture, so I really wouldn ’t put a lot in that. It could make sense. You could imagine narratives\nin which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’ t put too much on that. Sorry, your\nsecond question was?\nJONATHAN SPICER. The second question was whether the secular stagnation\nnarrative— whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that ?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we ’ve been throug h many years of growth around\n2 percent , and I ’ve given a number of public remarks where I ’ve called on, you know, the\ncountry to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, wh ich\ndrive potential growth. So, you know, I think it ’s really important that we do something —do\nwhat we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate. I would say in the bill that passed\nCongress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct, there were elements t hat should encourag e productivity, as\nI mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor\nforce participation. We don’ t know how big those effects are going to be. We don’ t know what\n\nPage the timing would be. I think , as you look around the table at the FOMC, there ’s a wide range of\nviews on the amount and the timing of those. I think all of us would agree that we hope that they\nwill be large.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Hi. Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires . I have a question\nabout the future of the mechanics of monetary policy. I wanted to know whether you favor\nsticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on ex cess reserves and reverse\nrepo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates —or do you want to s hift back to the old way\nof doing things at some point of targeting the fed funds market? And do you have any concern\nthat if you do sti ck with the current system that , as rates rise, that you might see issues where the\nFed is under —is being criticized fo r paying out ever larger shares of money to banks to, you\nknow, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting\nthis money?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. Our current framework for implementing monetary\npolicy is wor king very well. We have excellent contro l over rates, and it ’s working. And it’s—\nyou described it accurately. We haven ’t made a deci sion to keep that as our longer -run\nframework. We haven ’t really addressed that question. We ’ve had meetings where we’ ve talked\nabout it, and we ’ve agre ed that it’ s working well. But it’ s—and it ’s not something I see us as\nneeding to urgently address. I think we ’re continuing to learn about this framework. For\nexample, one —in the long -run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public ’s\ndemand for our liabilities , including currency and reserves. So we don’ t know what the demand\nis for reserves in a world where you have —you know, you have regulations that require banks to\nhold lot s of high- quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those. So it ’s not something we ’re\nlooking at resolving in the near term.\n\nPage You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it ’s a little bit of a\nmisnomer to think that there ’s a subsidy there. We pay interest on excess reserves. We can ’t\npay interest on excess reserves that are —is above the general level of short -term interest rates.\nSo we ’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other —any other\ninvestment in the short -term money markets. In addition, r emember that those liabilities —those\nare our liabilities. The assets that we have on the other side are T reasury securities and\nmortgage -backed securities , which yield much higher than interest on reserves. So, in fact, i t’s\nnot a subsidy, and it ’s not a cost to the taxpayer.\nGREG ROBB. Over here. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you very much. Greg Robb\nfrom MarketWatch. Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing\nconcern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances. I was wondering if\nyou could give us your view on the asset markets. Are—do you see any bubbles? And do you\nhave the tools you need, you think, to combat those? Thank you very much.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Since the financial crisis, we’ ve been monitoring financial\nconditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings\nabout the staff framework and , sort of , measures of various aspects of financial —financial\nstability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are\nmoderate, let ’s say . And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that.\nSo, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see\nhigher capital. You see much higher liquidity. You see them more aware of their risks and\nbetter able to m anage them with stress testing. And if one —if something does go wrong, you’ ve\ngot—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions. So, therefore, you\ndon’t see high leverage. You don’ t see excess risk -taking in great quantity the way you did s ee\n\nPage before the crisis. If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better\ncondition. If you look at nonf inancial corporations, you see —you do see relatively elevated\nlevels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks. And, of course, default\nrates are very low. So those readings look okay. I should mention also that for large financia l\ninstitutions, they ’re no longer funded by a lot of short -term wholesale funding, which can\ndisappear very quickly , so they ’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues. Overall, those aspects, I\nthink, suggest low levels of vulnerability.\nYou identified t he—really, one area where—which is an area of focus , which is asset\nprices. So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer -run historical norms.\nYou can think of some equity prices. You can think of commercial real estate prices i n certain\nmarkets. But we don’ t see it in housing, which is key. And so, overall, if you put all of that into\na pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities , in our view. In terms of whether we have the\ntools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we ce rtainly —we use them. We have— I think\nthe stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for\nthe smaller financial institutions. We regularly use that to —as a way to test against various, you\nknow, mar ket shocks, c ertainly for the larger institutions.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. More on the regulatory side, you\nknow, the F ed might soon be getting more power to de cide exactly which regulations —which\nstricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets. And so I had\na couple of questions about that. So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that ’s based around, you\nknow, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict divi dend payouts or stock\nbuybacks, i s there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don’ t have CCAR\nevery year for certain banks? Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis?\n\nPage And then, m y other question is, you know, you’ve talked a lot about how size isn ’t the\nonly thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering , what other factors do\nyou think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay. So, this is a matter that Congress has under\nconsideration. It’s not something —so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying\nenhanced financial standards to—f rom $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the\nability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it ’s appropriate.\nAnd, you know, we haven’ t been shy about doing that , because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs\nis below 250 already. So we are fully prepared to do that. But this is a decision t hat’s in the\nhands of Congress . It’s not something th at’s been —been taken. The version of the bill, I think,\nthat passed the Senate did have —did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests\nperiodically , as opposed to annually , is the language. We haven ’t made any decision about that\nat all. We woul d want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever\nwe do decide to do, we ’d put that out for comment. Is it, you know, logistically possible? I\nwould think it would be, but it ’s certainly not something that we ’ve decided to do. And the\nsecond question you had was?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. About w hat causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size .\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. Well, it’ s—I guess the next thing on the list would be\nactivities. So, you know, we —regular way c ommercial banks that do deposit taking and lending\nand don’ t specu late in markets, y ou know, that ’s one business model. Another business model\nmight be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right? That ’s what they do. They ’re\nspeculating on markets, and— you know, so ver y different business models and different levels\nof risk and that sort of thing. So, that ’s—that would be the next thing on the list. I mean, there\n\nPage would be a range of things, you know —how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those\nthings.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I’d like to\ngo back to the idea of the additional growth that you’ re getting from the fiscal package and ask\nyou how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand? You use\nwords like “might ” and “ should” about what results should come from this process , but, around\nthe table, did any of the presidents or G overnors report that businesses are actually getting ready\nto spend? Is this something that’ s going to happen? Do we know that there ’s going to be a\nsupply -side effect, or are you just guessing at this point?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Remember that there ar e 15 FOMC participants, and we —each\nof us has his or her own forecast. So there ’s a real diversity of views on this, pa rticularly on\nthese fiscal issues. If I could try to summarize, it woul d be that , I think, broadly speaking ,\nparticipants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for\nat least the next, let ’s say, three years. I think there ’s a general view as well that supply -side\nissues—that there could be supply -side effects as well, and you would see that again through\nhigher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment ,\nwhich would drive —tend to drive productivity over time. If you make investment more\nattractive, companies should do more of it. It’s uncertain, though. I mean, I spent many years of\nmy life working with companies and discussing—and , you know, the cost of capital is one of\nmany factors that they ’ll consider. It isn ’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should\nresult in more investment, and investment should drive productivity.\nAt the same time, the —you know, I mentioned labor supply. You should see some labor\nsupply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates. The whole thing is very\n\nPage uncertain, and particularly the supply -side effects should and would be expected to take longer to\nappear and would be less certain in amount. So that ’s really as good as you can go. And, you\nknow, we ’ve all looked at the literature carefully. We’ve all thought about it. We ’ve discussed\nit with our in -house experts and come up with our own views, a nd they ’re disparate, but that ’s—\nI’d say that ’s about where the —where the views are.\nDONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair Powell. Donna Borak with CNN. Just to go back to trade\npolicy, if you don’ t mind. You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade\npolicy shouldn’ t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there\nwas any discussio n—if there are fears about inflationary effects , should t here be trade barriers\nimposed? And, secondly, you know, we might be on the verge of a tit- for-tat trade war with\nChina. Wondering wha t your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic —the global\neconomic outlook going forward should that occur .\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants\ndiscussed —it wasn ’t—it was —it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low -\nprofile risk , which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook. That ’s really\nwhat people were saying. They didn ’t get into talking about particular —you know, whether it ’s\ninflation or growth or whatever it would be. So that ’s not something that did come up. You\nknow —your second question, sorry, was China?\nDONNA BORAK. Ye s. I mean, in the event t hat the United States and China —in the\nevent that the U.S. and China end up in a tit -for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that\nare imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic\noutlook, and whether that was something that was discussed a nd are you worried about .\n\nPage CHAIMRAN POWELL. That didn’ t—it’ s not something that ca me up in particular.\nAnd, let me say, you know, we don’ t do trade policy here at the F ed, and, you know, I would be\nreluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Does the\ninterest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough? Are you satisfied with\nthe rate of wage growth right now?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. As I mentioned, you know, we ’ve had unemployment decli ne\nsharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and\nwe’ve seen only modest increases in wages. So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory\nrepresent is inflation plus productivity increases. You should get paid for yo ur productivity plus\ninflation . And productivity ’s been very low. Inflation ’s been low. So these low wage\nincreases —in a sen se, they do make sense in that —from that perspective.\nOn the other hand, as the market ha s tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we\nhear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are\ndiminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, w e haven ’t seen, you know, higher\nwages —wages going up more. And I would— I think I ’ve been surprised by that, and I think\nothers have as well. In terms of what ’s the right level, I don ’t think I have a view on what the\nright level of wages is, but I think we will —we will know that the labor market is getting tight\nwhen we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agenc e France -Presse. If the economy\nbehaves as the F ed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be —keep on\nrising, a nd the prime r ate wi ll be above —well above 5 percent , a level not reached in 10 years\nfor what is a base of consumer credit. And we know that , historically, raising rates —especially\n\nPage in campaign times —has never been very popular in the White House. Does this prospect of a\npossible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. No. That doesn’ t keep me awake at night. We don’ t consider\nthe election cycle. You know, we —we ’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities\nof maximum employment, stable prices, and that ’s really our focus. You can count on us to stay\nfocused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to\nachieve them. You ’re right, that ’s the highest rate. By the way, I ’m hearin g this, the 10- year\nthing a few times these day s, and it ’s true that rates are higher than they ’ve been in 10 years. On\nthe other hand, the economy ’s healthier than it’ s been since—since before the financial crisis.\nSo, it ’s a healthier economy than it ’s been in 10 years. The financial crisis, of course, was just\nreally getting going 10 years ago.\nMYLES UDLAND. Thanks. My les Udland, Yahoo Finance. Ch air Powell, I ’m curious\nif the F ed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve. We continue t o see the spread\nbetween the 2 -year and the 10- year tighten , even with longer -term yields coming up since the\nbeginning of the year. This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we’ re likely\nto see sh orter -term rates come up as the F ed continues to increase rates. So, I ’m just curious if\nyou guys have discussed that, if you’ d be willing to push back against that , or if that’ s a dynamic\nyou’d be comfortable with?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, it ’s an interesting question, and ther e are a range of\nviews there. I think it ’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back\nover many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of\ncontrol, and the F ed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession. That ’s really not\nthe situation we ’re in now, so I don ’t know that that ’s—I don’ t know that —I don ’t think that\n\nPage recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are.\nBut, havin g said that, I think it’ s—there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or\ninverted yield curve does to intermediation. It’s hard to find in the research data, but\nnonetheless, I think those are issues that we ’ll be watching carefully.\nThank you very much."
