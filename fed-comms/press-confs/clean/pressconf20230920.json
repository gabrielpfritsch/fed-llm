  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone . My colleagues and I remain squarely\nfocused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the\nAmerican people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain\nstrongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal . Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor m arket conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pac e. We ’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects\nof our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we ’re in a position\nto proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,\nso far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particul arly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up\nsomewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections , or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments\n\nof real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent. Participants expect growth\nto cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a\nstrong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the yea r. The unemployment rate\nticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the\njobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nFOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward\npressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from\n3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the consumer\nprice index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3. 4 percent over the\n12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad\nrange of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are g uided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\n\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet th e higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted ea rlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage\npoints. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure\non economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to conti nue the process of significantly reducing our\nsecurities holdings.\nWe are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. In our SEP,\nFOMC particip ants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the\nfederal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely —sorry —the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median parti cipant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this\nyear, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025. Compared with our June Summary of Economic Projections , the median projec tion is unrevised for the end of this year\nbut has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years. These projections , of\ncourse, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will ad just as appropriate to foster our maximum- employment and price -stability\ngoals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the\n\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflatio n, as well\nas the balance of risks.\nGiven how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the\nincoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above\nmainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties\nin precisely gauging the stance of policy. We ’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,\nand we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we ’re confident that inflation is moving\ndown sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require\na period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions . Restoring price\nstability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over\nthe longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith wi th the Financial Times. What makes the\nCommittee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,\n\nespecially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?\nThere ’s noted uncertainty about policy lags. Headwinds have emerged from the looming\ngovernment shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments—things of that nature.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit\ndifferently. So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is —at\n5¼ to 5½ percent —while continuing to reduce our securities holdings. And we say we ’re\ncommitted to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive\nto bring down inflation to 2 percent over time —we said that. But the fact that we decided to\nmaintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn ’t mean that we ’ve decided that we have or have\nnot at this time reached that —that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking. If you looked at\nthe SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will —that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates\none more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already reached that. So it ’s, it’s something where we ’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by\ndeciding to —about that quest ion by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.\nCOLBY SMITH. So , right now, it’s still an open question about “ sufficiently\nrestrictive ”—you’re not saying today that we’ ve reached this level?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re not saying —yeah, no, no—c learly , we’re just —what we\ndecided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—we’ve —we ’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that. But , you know, we need to see more\nprogress before we’ ll be willing to —to reach that conclusion.\n\nCOLBY SMITH. And just on the 2024 projections —what ’s behind that shallower path\nfor interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates —real\ninterest rates are , are positive now. They ’re meaningfully positive , and that ’s a good thing. We\nneed policy to be restrictive so that we can get i nflation down to target. Okay. And we need —\nwe’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think, you know —\nremember that the —of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a\nplan. It ’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians. It ’s a cumulation of individual\nforecasts from 19 people, and then what you’ re seeing are the medians. So I wouldn’ t want to ,\nyou know, bestow upon it the idea that , that it’s really a plan. But what it reflects, though, is that\neconomic activity’ s been stronger than we expected —stronger than I think everyone expected.\nAnd, and so what you’ re—what you’re seeing is , this is what people believe, as of now, will be\nappropriate to achieve what we ’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our —toward our\ninflation goal, as you see in the SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let ’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Ch air Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding\nsteady? Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing? Could\nyou walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . So the proposal at the meeting was to —was to maintain our\ncurrent policy stance, and , and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that. But this,\nof course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think. A nd you’ ve got —you\nhave some —you saw , I think —seven wrote down no hike at this —at this meeting —or between\n\nnow and t he end of the year . And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next\ntwo meetings that we have between the end of the year. So it wasn ’t like we were arguing over\nthat—people just stating their positions —and, really , what , what people are saying is , “Let’s see\nhow the data come in. ” You know, we , we want to see—you know what we want to see. We\nwant to see that , that this, this —these good inflation readings that we ’ve been seeing for the last\nthree months —we want to see that it ’s more than just three months, right? We want to see, you\nknow —the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received , was a good\nexample of what we do —of what we do want to see. It was a combination of, of, you know,\nof—across a br oad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market. So those are\nthe two things —so those are our two mandate variables, and , and that ’s, that’s the progress that\nwe want to see. But I think people —they want to be convinced, you know —they want to be\ncareful to —not to jump to a conclusion, really , one way or the other —but just be convinced that\nthe data, you know, support that conclusion. And that ’s why, given how far we ’ve come and\nhow quickly we ’ve come, we ’re actually in a position to b e able to proceed carefully as we\nassess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting\nby meeting.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I see. And , in your view, what would— I know nothing has been\ndecided yet —but what would one more hi ke at the end of the year do to the economy or to\ninflation? And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out for us?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one\nway or the other won’ t matter . But, for us, we ’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it ’s a\npretty tight cluster of, of where we think that , that policy stance might be, but we ’re always\n\ngoing to be learning from data. You know, we ’ve learned all through the course of the la st year\nthat, actually , we needed to go further than we had thought. If you go back a year —and what we\nthought, what we wrote down—it’ s actually gotten higher and higher. So we , we don’ t really\nknow until —and that ’s why, again, we —we ’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point. A\nyear ago , we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up. Now— now we’re fairly close, we think,\nto where we need to get. It’ s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance. I wouldn’ t\nattribute huge importance to one hike in , in macroeconomic terms. Nonetheless, you know, we\nneed —we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring\ninflation down to 2 percent over time. That ’s what we need to get to, and we ’ve been—you\nknow, we’ve been moving toward it. As we ’ve gotten closer to it, we ’ve slowed the pace at\nwhich we ’ve moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we ’re getting closer , we, we —\nagain, we have the ability to proceed carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let ’s go to Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Li esman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby ’s\nquestion here. What is it saying about the C ommittee ’s view of the inflation dynamic in the\neconomy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a\npoint of the funds rate on it? Does it tell you that —does it tell us that the Committee believes\ninflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine , effectively? And I guess a related\nquestion is , if you’ re going to proje ct a funds rate above the longer -run rate for four years in a\nrow, at what point do we start to think, “ Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually\nhigher ”? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I , I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense\nof inflation having become more persistent , I wouldn’t think —that’s not —we’ve, we ’ve seen\n\ninflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn ’t say that ’s something\nthat’s appeared in the recent data. It’ s more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So\nif, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we ’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to\nattribute one explanation . But I think , broadly, stronger economic activ ity means , means rates—\nwe have to do more with rates, and that ’s what —that’s what that meaning is , is telling you. In\nterms of , of what the neutral rate can be —you know, we —we know it by its works. We only\nknow it by its works, really. We can ’t—we can ’t—you know , the, t he models and, and—that we\nuse, you—ultimately , you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.\nAnd, again, that ’s another reason why we ’re—why we’re moving carefully now , because, you\nknow, there are lags here. So it , it may —it may , of course, be that the —that the neutral rate has\nrisen. You do see people —you don’ t see the median moving —but you do see people raising\ntheir estimates of , of the neutral rate, and it ’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher\nthan, than the longer -run rate. Remember —what we write down in the SEP is the longer -run\nrate. It is certainly possible that, you know, that the —that the neutral rate at this moment is\nhigher than that , and that —that ’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more\nresilient than , than expected.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So you’ ve said\nseveral times that the economy needed a period of below -trend growth to get inflation\nconsistently back to 2 percent. You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit —1.5 percent is just a\ntouch below what ’s the estimate of potential. So the fact that you ’re getting so much done at so\nmuch less cost , does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how\n\nyou think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction\nthat’s necessary to achieve this?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, of course. It is a —it is a good thing that we, we ’ve seen now\nmeaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that ’s,\nthat’s because we’ re seeing that rebalancing in other places —in, for example, job openings and\nin the jobs –worker gap. You ’re also seeing supply -side things —so, so that ’s happening. I would\nsay, though, we still —I still think, and I think , broadly, people still think, that there will have to\nbe some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we ’ve seen as well.\nAlso, remember, the natural rate , we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply- side thing, so\nthat the , the gap between any given unemployment rate that ’s lower than that and the natural rate\ncomes down . That’s a way for supply—that ’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better\nbalance. So all of those things are happening. You ’re right —in, in the median forecast, we\ndon’t see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase, and— but that’s —that really is\njust “ playing forward ” the trends that we ’ve been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There , there\nmay come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that ’s, that’s really what\nwe’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So ju st to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we ’ve\ngone from a very narrow path to a —to a soft landing to something different. Would you call the\nsoft landing now a baseline expectation?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, no—I would not do that. I , I would just say—w hat, what would\nI say about that? I ’ve always thought that the soft landing was , was a plausible outcome—that\nthere was a path, really, to , to a soft landing. I’ve thought that , and I ’ve said that since we lifted\noff. It ’s also possible that , that the path ha s narrowed, and it ’s widened , apparently. Ultimately,\n\nit—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day. But I do\nthink it ’s—I do think it ’s possible. And, you know —I also think, you know, this is why we ’re in\na position to , to move carefully again. That —we, we will restore price stability. We, we know\nthat we have to do that , and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we\nhave to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is\nan extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We know that. The fact that we’ ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.\nSo I think, you know, that ’s, that’s the end we ’re trying to achieve. I wouldn’ t want to handicap\nthe likelihood of it, though. It’ s not up to me to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, both you and\nVice Chair Williams have indicated that “ sufficiently restrictive ” will be judged on a real rather\nthan nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year —provided further\ncompelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside. Is the FOMC focused on\ntargeting a real level of policy restriction? And can you explain what would constitute enough\nevidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, yes —we , we understand that it ’s a real rate that will matter\nand that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And, again, I would say, you know —you know\n“sufficiently restrictive ” only when you see it. You —it’s not something you can arrive at with\nconfidence in a model or , or in various estimates, you know. And so what are we seeing?\nWe’re, w e’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the , you know, the unwinding of the\npandemic -related demand and supply distortions and monetary polic y’s work in suppressing\n\ndemand or , or, you know, alleviating very high demand—t he combination of those two things is\nactually working. You ’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down. It’ s principally now in\ngoods —also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.\nSo I think— we think that that is working. And I , I think, you know —as we’ ve said, we , we want\nto reach that —we want to reach something that we’ re confident gets us to that level. And I think\nconfidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels\nlike it—we can —we can, for now , decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here. ”\nWe’re not per manently deciding not to go higher, but , but we would—let ’s say , if we get to that\nlevel —and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level? And that ’s a whole other set\nof questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.\nAnd we haven’ t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That ’s, that’s what\nwe’re —that’s, that’s the stage we’ re at, though.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. But it looks like there was— because there was an across- the-board\ndrop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent .\nWould you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you —than you\ncurrently anticipate?\nCHAIR POWELL. The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,\ncertainly , at the —at the last two meetings this year —it’s going to depend on the totality of all the\ndata: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the , the balance of risks, and\nthe other events that are happening out there. We’ll make —we take all of that into account, so I\ncan’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It’ll— it’ll be trying to reach a\n\njudgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that\nwould increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move , and it will help , help\nus be more confident that we ’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks, Chair Powell. Following up on Nick’ s question,\nactually —John Will iams, the New York F ed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of ,\n“Next year , as we see inflation kind of ”—again, to Nick’ s point —“as, as we see inflation coming\ndown, we ’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we ’re not squeezing the\neconomy harder and harder over time.” And I wonder if that ’s basically the logic that you\napply—you know, i s that how you think about it? And then I also wonder —in the la st press\nconference, you said something to the effect of , you know, “I t’s a full year out —those\ndiscussions, ” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’ t see a possibility of a rate cut in\nthe first half of next year. And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you\nknow —how you’ re thinking about that timing.\nCHAIR POWELL. No. When —so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals\nabout , about cutting, I ’m never intending to send a signal about timing ; I’m just answering them\nas, as the question is expressed. So , so please— I, I wouldn’ t want to be taken that way. Sorry —\nthe first question was, is that how? Yeah, so we’re —as we go into next year, th at’s the question\nwe’ll be asking is —you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about\nthe economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the , the time will come at some\npoint, and I ’m not saying when, that it ’s—that it’s appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that\nreal rates are rising because infl ation is coming down. Part of it just may be that— it’ll be all the\nfactors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.\n\nAnd you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that\nmight be. And, you know, there ’s—you know , there’s so much uncertainty around that. In, in—\nwhen we —in the moment, we ’ll do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this\nand say, “H ey, we made a plan.” It’s not like that at all. It’s—this is —these are estimates made\na year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that ’s how it is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks so much, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. I wonder —how\ndo you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we ’ve been seeing is driven\nby excess demand versus supply- side factors, productivity, labor force growth? And , relatedly,\nif GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own\nbe a reason to consider more tightening?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on, on your first question —I mean, we ’re looking at GDP very,\nvery carefully to try to understand really what ’s the direction of it—what ’s, what’s driving it.\nAnd it ’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know. It’s been —the consumer ’s been very robust\nin its —in spending. So that is, you know, that ’s how we ’re looking at it. Sorry, your second\nquestion was —\nNEIL IRWIN. Does GDP stay s “hot,” but without inflation ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I think the question will be —GDP is not our mandate, right?\nMaximum employment and price stability are the mandates. The question will be, is , is the\nlevel —is GDP —is the —is the heat that we see in GDP —is it really a threat to our ability to get\nback to 2 percent inflation? That ’s going to be the question. It’s not —it’s not a question about\nGDP on its own. It’ s, you —you know, you’ re expecting to see the —this improvement, you\nknow —continued rebalancing in the labor market and infl ation moving back down to 2 percent\n\nin a sustainable way. We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we ’d be—we’d be\nlooking at GDP just , just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guido with Politico. There are multiple external\nfactors that are playing out right now. We see rising oil prices. We see auto workers striking.\nThere ’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering,\nfor each of those things, could you talk about how you’ re thinking about how that might affect\nthe course for the F ed and the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them. But it—\nyou know, it ’s, it’s the strike, it’ s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,\nhigher long- term rates, oil price shock. You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you\ncan—you can look at. And, you know —so , what we try to do is assess all of them and , and\nhandicap all of them. And , ultimately, though, there ’s so much uncertainty around, around these\nthings. I mean, to , to start with the strike —first of all, we absolutely don ’t comment on the\nstrike , as we have no view on the strike one way or the ot her. But we , we do have to make an\nassessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the , the thing about it is —so\nuncertain. It will depend. The e conomic effects —it could affect —you’ve looked— we’ve\nlooked back at history— it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation. But that ’s really\ngoing to depend on how broad it is and how long it ’s sustained for. And we —and then it also\ndepends on how quickly production can make up for , for lost production. So none of those\nthings are known right now. It’ s very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that\nuncertain. And, and we ’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period ,\nmuch more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, we—I don’ t know if you\n\nmentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list. We don’ t comment on that. It\nhasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.\nYou know, energy prices being higher —that’s —that is a significant thing. We—e nergy\nprices b eing up can affect spending. It can affect the consumer over time. A sustained period of\nhigher —of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation. We tend to\nlook through short -term volatility and look at —look at core inflation. But so the question is ,\nhow long are , are higher prices sustained ? We have to —we have to take those macroeconomic\neffects into account as well. Those are —those are some of them. I’m not sure if I hit them all.\nBut—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’ re, you’re coming into this with an economy that\nappears to have significant momentum. And that ’s, that’s what we start with. And we —but we\ndo have this collection of risks that you mentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloombe rg News. I was a little surprised, Chair\nPowell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy’ s seeing\nadded supply in a way that could create long- term inflation stability. We have prime -age labor\nforce participation mov ing up where people can add skills. Workers want to work. We have a\nboom in manufacturing construction. We’ ve had a decent spate of homebuilding. And since\ninflation ’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity. All are\nwhich —good for the Fed’ s longer -run target of low inflation. And if we lose that in a recession,\naren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into\naccount as you pursue policy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say\notherwise. I mean, that ’s, that’s what we ’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.\n\nThe, the real point, though, is —the , the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price\nstability , because the record is clear on that : If you , you don’ t restore price stability, inflation\ncomes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’ s just very\nuncertain , and it will affect growth ; it will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period\nto have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and\nagain. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to rest ore price stability. I think\nnow, today, we actually —you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move\ncarefully, and that ’s what we ’re planning to do. So we fully appreciate that—you know, the\nbenefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market\nand inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important , large increase in\nunemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So —\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.\nWhen you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of\nwhat some economists are calling “ the low -hanging fruit ”—such as the unwinding of supply\nchain snarls and other pandemic disruptions —or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that\ninvolves most goods and services across the economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So if I—i f I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way :\nI thin k we knew from the time —from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we\nlift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going\nto help. It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,\n\nbetter aligning supply with demand. So those tw o forces were always going to be important. I\nthink it ’s very hard to pull them apart. They work together. I , I do think both of them are at\nwork now, and I think they’ re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we —that we are\nseeing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. In June,\nyou forecast a 5.6 percent year -end median fed funds rate, and since then , you’ve more than\ndoubled your growth forecast. You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So, what\nwould justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation? And given all\nthe known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or the American people have in your fo recasts?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult.\nForecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to, to your question,\nthough—what ’s happened is , growth has come in stronger, right ? Stronger than expected—and\nthat’s required higher rates. Unemployment, you know —you also see that the , the ultimate\nunemployment rate is not as high, but that —that ’s really because of what we’ ve been seeing in\nthe lab or market. We ’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing\nsignificantly higher unemployment. So we’re, we ’re continuing that trend. In terms of inflation,\nyou, you are seeing— the last three readings are , are very good readings. It’s only three readings,\nyou know. We—we ’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look\nat June, July, and August, you’ re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core\ninflation, largely in the goods sector —also to some extent in housing services and just a little in\nnonhousing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way\n\ndown, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think —people\nshould know t hat, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain\nforecasts. But these are —these are our forecasts. You know, they’re, they’re —we have very\nhigh- quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other\nforecasters. But just the nature of the business is , the economy is very difficult to forecast.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Given the —given the forecast that you have, what justified not\nmoving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming\ndown? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I , I think we have come very far very fast in , in the , the rate\nincreases that we’ ve made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,\nand we did. And , and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think —the stance of monetary\npolicy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation dow n to 2 percent over time, you know, the\nrisks become more two sided , and the risk of overtightening and the risk of , of undertightening\nbecomes more equal. And I think the , the natural, commonsense thing to do is , as you approach\nthat, you move a little m ore slowly as you get closer to it. And that, that’s what we ’re doing. So\nwe’re, we ’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more\ncarefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need\nto get inflation back down to 2 percent .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. With your focus on year -over-year PCE, isn ’t it true that base effects are huge\nand that by the time you meet in November , that it’ s more likely that you ’ll have a low PCE\nnumber that would make you feel more comfortable? And , secondly, how would the lack of key\n\nindicators —like CPI, the jobs report —impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to\nhave a government shutdown? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry —yeah, I missed the first question. What was —missed what\nfactors?\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. The base factors.\nCHAIR POWELL. Base factors. Ah. Okay. So on that , we’re, you know, we ’re\nlooking at just monthly , right ? You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase\nwas from the prior month. So you’ re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base\nfactors. But we can —we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data —you know , again, we\ndon’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns. It—i t’s possible —if, if there is a\ngovernment shutdown and it lasts through the , the next meeting, then it ’s possible we wouldn’ t—\nwe wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get , and we —you know, we\nwould just have to deal with that. And I don’ t know. It’ s hard for me to say in advance how that\nwould affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’ t know about now.\nBut it’ s certainly a reality that , that that’s a possibility.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects\nthat—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,\nwould you feel more comfortable at that point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, yes. I mean, if you ’re looking —if—we, we can tell how\nmuch inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And, you know, that ’s what we ’re looking\nat. And month by month, what ’s the reading? And, you know, I think —I think what we ’re\nreally looking at is , there ’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but\nthey’ re incredibly volatile , and they can be misleading. That ’s why we look at 12- month [rates] .\n\nBut I think , in this situation —where it looks like we ’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in\nJune—we ’re also looking at six months , and even three months, but really six months ’ inflation.\nSo you’ re looking at it over that period and over longer periods. T hat—that’s the right way to\ngo. And we don’ t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to —in, in getting to a conclusion about what\nto do. We can let the data evolve. So—\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward .\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks for the question, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence\nwith Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We’re seeing oil prices, as you\nmentioned, move up, and that ’s pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your\ndecision to raise rates or not —because i n the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we ’ve\nseen, the overall inflation has actually risen ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the\nconsumer. This, this can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.\nI mean, gas prices are one of the big things that , that affects consumer sentiment. It , it really\ncomes down to how persistent —how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look\nat core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.\nAnd it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’ t contain much of a signal about how\ntight the economy is, and hence don ’t tell you much about where inflation’ s really going.\nHowever, we ’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,\nthat’ll have an effect on spending. And , and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations\nof infl ation —things like that. That ’s just things we have to monitor.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. On the consumer —they’re putting more and more of this on\ntheir credit card. The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending. How long do you\n\nthink the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned\nabout a , a debt bubble related to that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that ’s why we tend to\nlook through energy moves that we —tha t we can see as, as short -term volatility. You know,\nturning to consumer credit, you know —of course , we watch that carefully. Consumer distress—\nmeasures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—during and after the , the pandemic. They ’re now moving back up to normal. We’ re, we’re\nwatching that carefully. But, at this point, these , these readings are not at troublingly high levels.\nThey ’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre -pandemic\nera.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with M NI Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve\nhave risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed ’s view about what ’s been driving that\nincrease in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations —and how\nmuch to technical factors?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I\nthink it ’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s —most , most people do a common decomposition\nof the increase, and the y’ll, they’ll—the view will be , it’s not —it’ s not mostly about inflation\nexpectations. It’ s mostly about other things, you know —either term premium or real yields —\nand it ’s, it’s hard to be precise about this. Of cour se, everyone ’s got models that ’ll give you a\nvery precise answer, but they give you different answers. So —but , essentially, they ’re, they’re\nmoving up because— it’s not because of inflation. It’ s because probably —it’ll probably have\n\nsomething to do with s tronger growth, I would say—more , more supply of Treasuries. You\nknow, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Kyle Campbell, American Banker. Thank you for taking the\nquestions —just two on, on housing. You ’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline\nand will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’ s also some questions out\nthere about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which\nare estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental\nmarket. So my question is , how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it ’s measured and\nfelt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply? And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock- in effect of mortgages being higher now\nthan they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about\ntaking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the supply point —of course, supply is very important over\ntime in , in setting house prices and, and , for that matter, rents. And so—and supply is kind of\nstructurally constrained. But in terms of, of where inflation ’s going in the near term, though, as ,\nas you obviously know, a lot of it is , is leases that are running off and then being re -signed or re -\nleased at a level that ’s, that’s not as —it won ’t be that much higher. A ye ar ago, it would have\nbeen much higher than it was a year before ; now it may be below or at the same level. So as\nthose leases are rolling over, we’ re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing\nservices inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock- ins. How much is that\naffecting things, really?\n\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates\ndown to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a\nlock- in that sort of stagnates the housing market?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I think we look at the —I would look at the lock- in, the , the idea\nbeing that people are in, in v ery low mortgage —very low -rate mortgages, and if—even if they\nwant to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive. And that ’s explaining some of the —that’s one of the explanations for what ’s happening broadly\nin the labor market. Would that play a role in , in our future decisions —in a —in a future tight—\nin a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I , I don’t think it would. I\nmean, I don’t think that’s —I, I think we ’d be looking at , what , you know, fundamentally, what ,\nwhat rates does the economy need? And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic\nor during the Global F inancial C risis, you, you know, the, the —you have to cut rates to the point\nthat—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t think\nthat that would be a reason for us not to do that. It ’s not something we ’re thinking about at all\nright now. But , down the road, I wouldn’ t think so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARS HALL -GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, you’ ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,\nmaybe cut back consumer spending —possible government shutdown, high gas prices. At this\npoint, woul d the F ed welcome a decrease in consumer spending? Would that help you get\ninflation closer to your 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. I , I wouldn’ t say it that way. We’ re not looking for a decrease in\nconsumer spending. It’s, it’s a good thing that the e conomy’ s strong. It’s a good thing that the\n\neconomy has been able to hold up under , under the tightening that we ’ve done. It’ s a good thing\nthat the labor market ’s strong. The , the only concern—it , it just means this : If the economy\ncomes in stronger than expected, that just means we ’ll have to do more in terms of monetary\npolicy to get back to 2 percent —because we will get back to 2 percent . Does that answer your\nquestion?\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Yeah . And I guess , on the other hand, would you\nworry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that ’s always a concern. I mean, concern number one is , is\nrestoring price stability , because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that\nwe can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight\nlabor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I ’ve said a couple times. So that , that said—of\ncourse, you know —we, we also now, given how far we ’ve come with our rate hikes and how\nquickly we ’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of\nthat co nsideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVI TCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovi tch with t he\nEconomist. One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of\nrate sensitivity than in the past. Obviously, we ’ve talked about households with long fixed- rate\nmortga ges—also companies that refinanced before last year. What is your thinking about the\nefficacy of rates and how that ’s changed? And then, related to that, how do you think about the\ndistributional consequences in the sense that if you’ re a relatively weal thy household with a long\nfixed -rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if\n\nyou’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a\nlot tougher a lot more quickly? Thank s.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what —I guess it ’s fair— it’s fair to say that the economy has\nbeen stronger than many expected, given, given what ’s been happening with, with interest rates.\nWhy is that? Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sen se. One , one\nis just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had\nunderstood, and so that , that spending has held up —and that kind of thing. We’ re not sure about\nthat. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that ’s\nsustainable. That could —it could just mean that the —that the date of effect is, is later. It could\nalso be that for other reasons , the neutral rate of interest is , is higher for —for various reasons.\nWe don’ t know that. It could also just be that policy hasn’ t been restrictive enough for long\nenough. And it’s —there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in , in all this\nuncertainty, make policy, and I , you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’ s still a\nvery strong labor market —but that ’s coming back into balance. We were making progress on\ninflation. Growth is strong. But I think by many forecasts —many, many, many forecasts call\nfor growth to, to mode rate over the course of the next year. So that ’s where we are, and , you\nknow, we have to —we have to deal with what comes. On your second question, which was —\nsorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer\nabout that?\nSIMON RABINOVI TCH. Yeah . My point there was that if you ’re somebody who has a\nlong fixed- rate mortgage, you’ ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily. If you’ re\nsomebody who’ s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are\npunitive.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes . And so the point I would make there is that we ’re trying to get\ninflation back down. The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a\nfixed income. If you’ re a person wh o spends all of your income, you don ’t really have any\nmeaningful savings. You spend all your income on the basics of life —clothing, food,\ntransportation, heating —the basics— and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent , you’ re in trouble right\naway, whereas even , even middle -class people have some savings and some ability to absorb\nthat. So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,\nand we , we want to do it as quickly as possible. Obviously, we —we ’d like to do that . We’ d like\nthe current trend to continue, which is that we ’re making progress without seeing the kind of\nincrease in unemployment that we ’ve seen past —in past things. But you’ re right, though. When\nwe raise rates, people who are, you know, living on cr edit cards and , and borrowing are going to\nfeel that more. They are. And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a —have a\nmuch lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to —it’ s not going to affect\nthem as much.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the Beige\nBook recently, you can tell that the F ed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups\nabout the economic hea lth of low -income Americans—moderate -income Americans. I have two\nquestions about this. Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a\nquarterly survey of those groups —like the senior loan officer survey? And from your —and also\nthe second question is , from your recent look— readings of these surveys, how are low and\nmoderate Americans doing? Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy\n\nAmericans kind of driving things? I just want to get your sense of the he alth of that sector.\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I don’ t know about the quarterly survey. That ’s an idea we\ncan—we can take away and think about. In terms of how low and moderate Americans —you\nknow, they’re clearly —were suffering from, from high inflation. I think during the pandemic,\nthe, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And, you know, if you know\nthe—the surveys that we take showed that —showed that low- and moderate -income people were\nactually in very, very st rong financial condition. I think now it ’s a very “ hot” labor market, and\nyou’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’ re starting to see [ that growth rates of]\nreal wages are now positive by most —by most measures. So I , I think , overall , households are\nin good shape.\nSurveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of\nthat is just, people hate inflation —hate it. And that , that causes people to say , “The economy’ s\nterrible .” But, at the same time , they’re spending money. Their behavior is , is not exactly what\nyou would expect from the surveys. That’s kind of a , a guess at what the answer might be. But\nI, I think there ’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets —and, certainly , in\nthe labor market and with wages. The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low -\nwage jobs —and now [with] inflation coming down—you’ re seeing [increases in] real wages,\nwhich is a good thing.\nThanks very much."
