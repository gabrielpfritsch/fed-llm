  "text": "At \"Expanding the Impact: Increasing Capacity and Influence,\" the 2017 Interagency Minority Depository Institution and Community Development Financial Institution Bank National Conference, Los Angeles, California Thank you, Donna. Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve. We are honored to have you here today as we host the biennial Interagency Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and Community Development Financial Institution Bank Conference. My colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and I are especially honored to be hosting you in Los Angeles. As you probably know, all of the previous Interagency MDI conferences have been held on the East Coast, mainly in Washington, D.C. However, because the largest concentration of minority banks is located here in Southern California, it seemed natural to bring this conference west. First, half of our monetary policy mandate is maximum sustainable employment. That means that we need to be aware of employment trends across all communities in America, not just the top-line averages, since unemployment rates vary significantly across races and geographies. For the first time, last year, we put into our Monetary Policy Report to Congress a section that detailed how post-recession economic gains have been distributed across races.1 You, as MDIs, are committed to understanding and serving these diverse communities. I know that, for example, your small business loans to minority business owners make a difference in the employment rates of minority communities. I thank you for that work, and we will continue to work closely with you to better understand the employment dynamics of underserved and minority communities. Fourth, and last, the Fed has a unique Community Development function that seeks to mobilize ideas, networks, and approaches that address a wide range of community and economic development challenges. One thing that makes our Community Development function unique is that we have deep geographic coverage at the 12 Reserve Banks and their Branch locations. Last year, we combined the resources of our Supervision and Regulation division with those of our Community Development department to staff our Partnership for Progress. By bringing in Community Development, we brought in a new perspective, one that has an explicit focus on low- and moderate-income communities. We know that you serve many of these same individuals and communities, and we are asking our Community Development staff around the country to reach out to you to gather your perspectives on the communities you serve to identify emerging issues of which we should be aware. In closing, your institutions are important to the American economy and our understanding of that economy. Therefore, on behalf of the Federal Reserve, I'd like to once again thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to Los Angeles."
