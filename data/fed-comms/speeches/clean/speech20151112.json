The global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the way many think about monetary policy. At the peak of the crisis and during its immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. The post-crisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the effectiveness of different policy options. Specifically, policymakers have to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation frameworks in the presence of new policy tools. Moreover, policymakers should be mindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from the intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed by the crisis. Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect of regulations and possible changes in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission. The impressive conference program covers the following topics in three sessions: monetary policy implementation, the transmission of monetary policy, and the effect of regulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission. The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a stimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days. Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary policy. Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the effect of regulations on monetary policy and the \"optimal design\" of monetary policy in the post-crisis world. Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I hope you all have enjoyable and productive discussions over the next two days."
