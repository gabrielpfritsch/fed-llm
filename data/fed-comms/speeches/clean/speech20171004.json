  "official": "Chair Janet L. Yellen",
  "event": "At Community Banking in the 21st Century Fifth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference cosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri",
  "text": "We have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our decisions affect institutions and the customers they serve. We are well aware that community banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often underserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized services than are often otherwise available. We know that community bankers are part of the communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the aspirations of their customers. In closing, let me thank the conference organizers with the Fed and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the scholars and others making presentations, and all of you for attending. I hope you have a terrific conference."
