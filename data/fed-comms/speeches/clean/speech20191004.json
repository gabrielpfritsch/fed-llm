  "text": "As we kick off this 12th of 14 Fed Listens events, Governor Brainard, Governor Bowman, and I hope that today's meeting is anything but stuffy. Candid and serious, yes. But not stuffy. The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. Almost all of the Fed Listens meetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. Both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us. One reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more effectively. But we must pose that question not just to ourselves. Because Congress has granted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures, we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. And we have an obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected representatives can hold us accountable. We've invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects the lives of the people your organizations representâunion members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others. We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stabilityâthe monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us. So, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. Doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies. More-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. We are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes. Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy. After today, we have two Fed Listens sessions remaining, both later this month: one in Kansas City and another in Chicago. At the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and I began discussing what we've learned so far from the Fed Listens events. We continued that discussion at our September meeting and have a lot left to do. We plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year. One clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our historically strong job market. People from low- and moderate-income communities tell us this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. Employers are partnering with community colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. And people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities. Once again, welcome. Now it is your turn to speak. We're listening."
