As we think about new directions for economic measurement, we might start by reminding ourselves of the purpose of economics. Textbooks describe economics as the study of the allocation of scarce resources. That definition may indeed be the \"what,\" but it certainly is not the \"why.\" The ultimate purpose of economics, of course, is to understand and promote the enhancement of well-being. Economic measurement accordingly must encompass measures of well-being and its determinants. But, as many of you will discuss this week, aggregate statistics can sometimes mask important information. For example, even though some key aggregate metricsââincluding consumer spending, disposable income, household net worth, and debt service paymentsââhave moved in the direction of recovery, it is clear that many individuals and households continue to struggle with difficult economic and financial conditions. Exclusive attention to aggregate numbers is likely to paint an incomplete picture of what many individuals are experiencing. One implication is that we should increase the attention paid to microeconomic data, which better capture the diversity of experience across households and firms. Another implication, however, is that we should seek better and more-direct measurements of economic well-being, the ultimate objective of our policy decisions. Measurement of well-being is an important direction, but just one of many new directions for economic measurement being explored in the field generally and at this conference in particular. I am glad to see scholars and practitioners continuing to push the frontiers of economic measurement with a broad perspective and with open minds. As Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal character Sherlock Holmes aptly put it, \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\"7 As I said at the beginning, good economic analysis and policymaking depend on good measurement, and the work you are doing will accordingly yield significant benefits. I thank you for the opportunity to give these short remarks, and I wish you the best for a productive and stimulating conference. 1. See Ben S. Bernanke (2010), \"The Economics of Happiness,\" speech delivered at the University of South Carolina commencement ceremony, Columbia, S.C., May 8. Return to text 2. Canonical models of economic decisionmaking presume individual maximization of \"utility,\" or well-being. They tend to focus on the consumption of goods or services and assume that more consumption is preferred to less. For example, see Andrew Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, and Jerry R Green (1995), Microeconomic Theory (New York: Oxford University Press). Return to text 3.
