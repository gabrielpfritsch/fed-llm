  "text": "Just as railroads were instrumental to economic development in the 19th century, interstate highways such as I-95--the vision of President Eisenhower--have been crucial in our own time. The interstates lowered transportation costs markedly and knitted our national economy together, thereby raising productivity. The proximity of Interstate 95, which stretches the length of the East Coast from Maine to Florida, supports manufacturing and distributive industries in and around Dillon. Of course, I am aware that Dillon faces challenges today, as do many communities. But the area has much to offer. This Wellness Center, for example, just two years old, serves as a valuable community resource. But perhaps Dillon's greatest resource is the determination and resilience of its people. Like all natives of Dillon, I'm sure, I was proud to see Ty'Sheoma Bethea sitting alongside Michele Obama as the President delivered his speech to the Congress. (In fact, since Ty'Sheoma is now Dillon's most-famous resident, I wonder if it might not be more appropriate to name this interchange after her.) As all of Dillon knows, Ty'Sheoma was sitting with the First Lady because of a letter she had written to members of Congress to ask them for help for her school (and my former school). She also wrote of the desire of her classmates to achieve, to become lawyers and doctors--and members of Congress. I want to applaud Ty'Sheoma and her classmates for their thirst for knowledge. Education is the foundation of our country's past and future economic prosperity. The determination of Ty'Sheoma and her classmates is an inspiration. As she wrote in her letter, \"We are not quitters.\" Well, neither are the American people, despite the economic challenges we now confront. For our part, at the Federal Reserve, we will continue to forcefully deploy all the tools at our disposal as long as necessary to support the restoration of financial stability and the resumption of healthy economic growth.
