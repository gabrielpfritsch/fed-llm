  "event": "At the \"Community Banking in the 21st Century,\" a Conference Co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, St. Louis, Missouri",
  "text": "Community banking is fundamentally a local, relationship-based business. Community bankers live in the localities they serve; their customers are their neighbors and friends. Their direct, personal knowledge of the local economy enables them to tailor products and services to meet their communities' needs. They can look beyond credit scores and other model-based metrics to make lending decisions in part based on more qualitative information that large regional or national financial institutions are less well suited to consider. Community bankers recognize that their own success depends on the health of the communities they serve, which is why so many community bankers contribute locally as citizens and leaders as well as in their capacities as lenders and providers of financial services. The photos that you see around the conference center do a very nice job of capturing the spirit of community banking and illustrating the contributions of community bankers. Although community banks have some natural advantages, such as local knowledge and relationships, they also face significant challenges. As battle-scarred survivors of a financial crisis and deep recession, community bankers today confront a frustratingly slow recovery, stiff competition from larger banks and other financial institutions, and the responsibility of complying with new and existing regulations. Some observers have worried that these obstaclesââparticularly complying with regulationsââmay prove insurmountable. My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I understand these concerns, and we are committed to crafting supervisory policies and regulations that are appropriately scaled to banks' size and complexity. And we have confidence that the remarkable resilience of America's community bankers will enable them not only to survive, but also to thrive in the years ahead. Of course, understanding those concerns is of limited value unless we use what we have learned in the process of rulemaking. To make that connection, we also established a subcommittee of the Board that reviews all regulatory and supervisory proposals for their potential effects on community banks. The subcommittee also has worked toward communicating more effectively with the industry regarding the extent to which new rules and guidance do, or do not, apply to community banks. I hope those efforts are helping community bankers avoid spending time trying to understand rules that do not apply to them. Thank you for being here. I wish you an enjoyable and productive conference."
