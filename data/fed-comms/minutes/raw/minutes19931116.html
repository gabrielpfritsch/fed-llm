  <p>By unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on September 21, 1993, were approved.</p>
  <p>The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, 
    conducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and 
    Payment Systems as of the close of business on April 30, 1993, was 
    accepted.</p>
  <p>The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
    in foreign exchange markets during the period since the September 
    meeting. There were no open market transactions in foreign currencies 
    for System account during this period, and thus no vote was required 
    of the Committee.</p>
  <p>By unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal for 
    further periods of one year of the System's reciprocal currency 
    (&quot;swap&quot;) arrangements with foreign central banks and the Bank for 
    International Settlements. The amounts and maturity dates of these 
    arrangements are indicated in the table that follows:</p>

  <p>The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
    in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
    in U.S. government securities and federal agency obligations during 
    the period September 21, 1993 through November 15. 1993. By unanimous 
    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.</p>
  <p>The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    and financial outlook and the formulation of monetary policy for the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
  <p>The information reviewed at this meeting suggested some 
    strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months. 
    Consumer spending had picked up: housing activity was quickening; and 
    business spending for durable equipment had continued to trend higher, 
    though at a reduced pace. Industrial production, particularly 
    manufacturing, and employment had posted solid gains. At the same 
    time, inflation had remained muted, with consumer prices increasing 
    moderately on balance in recent months and producer prices falling.</p>
  <p>Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in 
    September and October after declining slightly in August. Although 
    job gains were widespread in October, a large part of the increase was 
    in various business services, notably temporary employment agencies. 
    In other categories, construction employment registered its largest 
    monthly rise since last spring, and jobs in manufacturing increased 
    after seven months of declines. The civilian unemployment rate edged 
    up to 6.8 percent in October.</p>
  <p>Industrial production rose sharply in October, with manufacturing more than accounting for the increase. Part of the gain in 
    manufacturing reflected a further rebound in the output of motor 
    vehicles and parts. Aside from motor vehicles, however, the production of business equipment was lifted by another surge in office and 
    computing equipment, and the output of consumer goods was boosted by 
    strength in furniture and appliances. Utilization of total industrial 
    capacity rose in October, reaching a level last seen in the fourth 
    quarter of 1992.</p>
  <p>Nominal retail sales were up substantially in October after 
    changing little in September. Sales in October were boosted by a 
    turnaround in spending at automobile dealerships and by a surge at 
    building materials and supply stores. Sales at other types of retail 
    outlets were mixed. Purchases at general merchandise stores were 
    brisk. However, sales at apparel outlets and at furniture and 
    appliance stores edged down after rising strongly for several months, 
    and the increase in spending at gasoline stations entirely reflected 
    the effects of the new federal gasoline tax on pump prices. Housing 
    activity strengthened further in the third quarter. Starts of single-family homes in August and September were at their highest levels in 
    almost five years; starts of multifamily units also picked up in 
    September, although construction activity in this sector remained at a 
    very low level. Sales of new and existing homes moved up further in 
    the third quarter and were especially strong in September.</p>
  <p>Real business capital spending increased in the third 
    quarter at a considerably slower pace than earlier in the year. The 
    slowdown largely reflected a smaller rise in spending for producers' 
    durable equipment, as reduced outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles 
    more than offset continued strong gains in spending for computing 
    equipment and other capital goods. Nonresidential construction was 
    down slightly in the third quarter after a sizable advance over the 
    first half of the year. Office and industrial building activity 
    appeared to have bottomed out, but high vacancy rates and declining 
    property values continued to limit new construction.</p>
  <p>Business inventories climbed significantly further in 
    September; for the third quarter as a whole, however, stocks were 
    accumulated at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the 
    year. At the retail level, inventories rebounded in September after 
    declining on balance over July and August. The ratio of inventories 
    to sales for retailing edged up in September but remained near the low 
    end of its range over the past year. Inventory accumulation in the 
    wholesale sector slowed in September after rising substantially in 
    August: the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged at 
    the midpoint of its range over the past several years. In 
    manufacturing, stocks dropped in September after changing little over 
    the two previous months; with factory shipments up, the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as whole fell in September to its 
    lowest level in recent years.</p>
  <p>The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined further 
    in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was about the 
    same as its average rate for the second quarter. The value of both 
    exports and imports was slightly lower in July-August than in the 
    second quarter. The decline in the value of exports primarily 
    reflected shortfalls in shipments of aircraft and automotive products,  
    and the drop in imports was associated with reduced imports of oil and 
    automotive products. Available data indicated that the performance of 
    the major foreign industrial economies continued to be mixed. 
    Economic activity appeared to have remained weak in Japan in the third 
    quarter and to have stagnated in western Germany after increasing 
    moderately in the second quarter. On the other hand, the recessions 
    in France and Italy seemed to have bottomed out, and the economies of 
    Canada and the United Kingdom to have recovered somewhat further.</p>
  <p>Producer prices for finished goods fell in October, 
    retracing the small increase in September; excluding the effects of 
    higher prices for finished foods and energy goods, producer prices 
    were down over the September-October period. Over the twelve-month 
    period ended in October, producer prices for nonfood, non-energy 
    finished goods were fractionally higher on balance, the lowest yearly 
    increase on record for this index, which was introduced in 1973. 
    Consumer prices rose in October after being unchanged in September, 
    with the increase partly reflecting the effect of the implementation 
    of the new federal gasoline tax. For nonfood, non-energy consumer 
    items, the rise in consumer prices over the twelve months ended in 
    October was considerably smaller than the rise over the comparable 
    period ended in October 1992. Labor compensation costs did not show a 
    comparable downtrend. The increase in hourly compensation for private 
    industry workers in the third quarter was about the same as in the 
    second quarter. For the twelve months ended in September, hourly 
    compensation advanced slightly faster than over the comparable year-earlier period.</p>
  <p>At its meeting on September 21, 1993, the Committee adopted 
    a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of 
    pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption 
    about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the 
    intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and 
    M3 over the balance of the year.</p>
  <p>Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above 
    anticipated levels as a result of increased demands for adjustment 
    credit associated with quarter-end pressures in financial markets and 
    an unexpected swing in the Treasury balance. The federal funds rate 
    remained close to 3 percent over the period.</p>
  <p>Most other interest rates were up somewhat over the period 
    since the Committee's September meeting. Treasury bill rates rose in 
    part because of the Treasury's need to rely more heavily on bill 
    issuance in a quarter containing a reduced schedule for auctioning 
    long-term debt. Intermediate- and long-term yields fell in the weeks 
    following the September meeting and reached twenty-year lows. These 
    declines were more than reversed subsequently, however, when investors 
    interpreted incoming data as suggesting stronger economic growth and 
    credit demands over the intermediate term and a somewhat greater 
    likelihood of some tightening of monetary policy. Most indexes of 
    stock market prices posted robust gains early in the intermeeting 
    period, but these gains subsequently were pared back as interest rates 
    moved higher.</p>
  <p>In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated over the 
    intermeeting period. The strengthening of the dollar, and the 
    associated rise in U.S. long-term interest rates relative to foreign 
    rates, reflected both more optimistic expectations for growth in the 
    United States and more pessimistic assessments for the course of 
    economic activity in continental Europe and Japan.</p>
  <p>M2 registered a relatively strong advance in September, but 
    growth slowed again in October. The September pickup partly reflected 
    an unexpected surge in the volatile overnight repurchase agreement 
    (RP) component of M2. Ml also was strong, but the total of time and 
    savings deposits continued to decline, apparently in large part 
    because of the persisting allure of capital market instruments. 
    Growth of M3 strengthened somewhat more than M2 over the two months, 
    reflecting a run-up in institution-only money market funds. For the 
    year through October, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates 
    a little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. 
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent 
    months, and for the year through September it was estimated to have 
    increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring 
    range.</p>
  <p>The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested 
    that economic activity, after advancing relatively strongly in the 
    fourth quarter, would expand moderately next year, about in line with 
    the potential rate of economic growth over time, and thus would be 
    associated with limited, if any, further reductions in margins of 
    unemployed labor and capital. Consumer spending, which had buoyed 
    growth recently, was expected to expand at the same pace as incomes 
    over the year ahead. In addition, fiscal restraint and uncertainty 
    about other government policies would continue to inhibit the 
    expansion, and a sluggish acceleration in foreign industrial economies 
    pointed to only modest improvement in export demand. However, 
    improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were 
    lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest 
    rates would encourage further increases in business fixed investment 
    and housing construction. The continued slack in labor and product 
    markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was 
    expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation.</p>
  <p>In the Committee's discussion of the economic outlook, 
    members commented that the economic data and anecdotal reports 
    received since the September meeting had tended to reinforce their 
    earlier forecasts that moderate economic expansion would be sustained. 
    After a sluggish performance in the first half of the year, overall 
    economic activity had picked up somewhat more in the third quarter 
    than most members had anticipated and available indicators of spending 
    and production pointed to relatively robust economic growth in the 
    current quarter. Looking ahead to 1994, the members expected the 
    expansion to slow somewhat from its apparent pace over the closing 
    months of this year. Fluctuations in the rate of quarterly GDP growth 
    undoubtedly would occur, but the economy over the year ahead was 
    thought likely to continue on a trend of moderate expansion averaging 
    close to the economy's long-run potential or somewhat higher. Most 
    members saw the probability of a sharp deviation in either direction 
    from their current forecasts as relatively remote, though a number 
    also believed that any deviation was more likely to be in the 
    direction of somewhat stronger rather than weaker growth. In general, 
    members expected core inflation to change little or to edge lower next 
    year, but a few saw some danger of marginally higher inflation.</p>
  <p>In their assessment of developments underlying the economic 
    outlook, members referred to indications in many areas of some 
    strengthening in business conditions and in related business 
    sentiment, though economic activity clearly remained sluggish or even 
    depressed in some parts of the country and overall business attitudes 
    could still be described as cautious. Current financial conditions, 
    including the strength in equity markets, reduced intermediate- and 
    long-term interest rates, and an apparently improving availability of 
    business credit from financial institutions, provided a favorable 
    backdrop for further economic expansion. Moreover, businesses and 
    households had made substantial progress in improving their financial 
    positions. These factors were seen as reducing downside risks to the 
    expansion. At the same time, while there were signs of significant 
    firming in the economic expansion, a number of members observed that 
    at this point they did not see the usual indications of any near-term 
    intensification of inflationary pressures such as general increases in 
    commodity prices, lengthening delivery lead times along with efforts 
    to increase inventories, and strong growth of credit. Indeed, the 
    risks of an overheated and inflationary expansion in the near term 
    seemed quite limited in light of various constraints on the economy 
    such as those associated with a restrictive fiscal policy and the 
    continuing weakness in key export markets.</p>
  <p>With regard to the outlook for specific sectors of the 
    economy, a step-up in consumer spending, notably for motor vehicles 
    and housing-related durable goods, had contributed substantially to 
    the strengthening of the economic expansion. Indications of improving 
    consumer confidence, reflected in turn in the growing optimism 
    expressed by business contacts regarding the outlook for holiday 
    sales, should help to sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending 
    through the year-end. Contacts in the motor vehicles industry also 
    appeared to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for sales of 
    the new models. The outlook for the consumer sector also was subject 
    to some constraining influences. Growth in consumer spending had 
    tended to exceed the expansion in consumer incomes and a number of 
    members questioned the extent to which the acceleration in such 
    spending was likely to extend into the new year. The saving rate 
    already was near the low end of its historic range, at least on the 
    basis of current estimates, and was unlikely to decline significantly, if at all. Much would depend on consumers' outlook for 
    employment and incomes. Growing demands should eventually be 
    translated into faster employment gains, but at this point business 
    firms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite 
    increasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce 
    reductions. While net gains in employment, including growth 
    associated with increases in self-employment and new business 
    formations, were continuing, expansion in jobs and consumer incomes 
    probably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead. Against 
    this background, members generally expected moderate growth in 
    consumer spending to be maintained, but they did not see such spending 
    as likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in 
    1994.</p>
  <p>The members anticipated appreciable further expansion in 
    business investment spending, especially in the context of reduced 
    interest rates, improved business balance sheets, and ongoing efforts 
    to improve productivity. Growth in spending for business equipment 
    probably would continue at a relatively vigorous pace, though perhaps 
    somewhat below the growth rates experienced in recent quarters, and 
    other investment activity seemed poised to pick up. In this 
    connection, several members reported that vacancy rates in commercial 
    office buildings were declining in some areas and while this 
    development was not yet being translated into appreciable new 
    construction, investment funds appeared to be flowing more freely into 
    commercial real estate. Clear indications of strengthening were 
    observed in housing construction in many parts of the country and the 
    outlook for such building activity seemed promising in the context of 
    reduced mortgage rates and improving consumer sentiment.</p>
  <p>Fiscal policy developments, including the effects on 
    business attitudes of the uncertainties surrounding health care reform 
    legislation, were likely to continue to inhibit the expansion over the 
    year ahead. Some members again emphasized the negative effects that 
    the ongoing retrenchment in defense spending was having on local 
    economies as well as on the economy more generally. On the taxation 
    side, the rise in tax liabilities on higher incomes could have an 
    especially pronounced effect during the early months of next year, 
    given the retroactive inclusion of 1993 incomes subject to the new 
    tax, but some members noted that the increased tax payments probably 
    had been widely anticipated and the negative implications for the 
    economy might well be less than many observers expected. Nonetheless, 
    the overall posture of fiscal policy and associated business concerns 
    about the cost implications of possible future legislation were likely 
    to be an important factor tending to limit the strength of the 
    expansion.</p>
  <p>Net exports were seen as another constraining factor in the 
    performance of the economy next year. On the import side, even 
    moderate expansion in domestic economic activity was likely to 
    stimulate appreciable further growth in U. S. demands for foreign 
    goods. At the same time, the prospects for exports to a number of 
    major industrial countries were not promising, at least for the nearer 
    term, given lagging economies in Europe and Japan. In this connection 
    a number of members referred to reports of weak export demand for 
    specific U.S. products and also noted that an extended coal mining 
    strike had cut supplies of coal available for export and had induced 
    some domestic firms to turn to imports to help fill their requirements. On the other hand, some markets for U.S. exports, notably 
    those in a number of East Asian nations and some Latin American 
    countries, were likely to continue to experience considerable growth, 
    thereby mitigating an otherwise fairly gloomy outlook for exports.</p>
  <p>With regard to the outlook for inflation over the year 
    ahead, views did not vary greatly among the members. They ranged from 
    expectations of some limited progress toward price stability to 
    forecasts of a marginal increase in the core rate of inflation. 
    Members who anticipated a relatively favorable inflation performance 
    tended to underscore the likely persistence of appreciable slack in 
    labor and other production resources on the assumption that growth in 
    overall economic activity would remain on a moderate trend in line 
    with their forecasts. Some also pointed to the absence of 
    inflationary pressures in most commodity markets, the persistence of 
    intense competition in local markets across the nation, and the 
    outlook for relatively subdued increases in labor costs in part 
    because of ongoing improvements in productivity. Other members gave 
    more emphasis to the possibility that the economic expansion next 
    year, especially if it turned out on the high side of the range 
    encompassing the members' current projections, was more likely to be 
    associated with some upward pressures on costs and prices. In this 
    connection, relatively rapid growth in economic activity, should it 
    persist into the early part of next year, probably would trigger 
    attempts to raise prices and wages somewhat more rapidly even in the 
    context of some continuing slack in overall capacity and labor 
    utilization. At this point, however, there were no significant 
    indications of accelerating inflation and business contacts around the 
    nation did not currently see or seem to anticipate increasing 
    inflationary pressures.</p>
  <p>In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, the members generally agreed that despite various 
    indications of a pickup in economic growth, the underlying economic 
    situation and the outlook for inflation had not changed sufficiently 
    to warrant an adjustment in monetary policy. Looking beyond the 
    intermeeting period, however, several members commented that the 
    Committee might well have to consider the need to move from the 
    currently stimulative stance of monetary policy toward a more neutral 
    policy posture, should concerns about rising inflationary pressures 
    begin to be realized. The members recognized the desirability of 
    taking early action to arrest incipient inflationary pressures before 
    they gathered strength, especially given the Committee's commitment 
    not just to resist greater inflation but to foster sustained progress 
    toward price stability. In appropriate circumstances, a prompt policy 
    move also might allay market concerns about inflation with favorable 
    implications for longer-term interest rates and the performance of 
    interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The members acknowledged 
    that current measures of inflation and anecdotal reports from around 
    the nation did not on the whole suggest an intensification of 
    inflation at this point. Moreover, the Committee had to be wary of 
    misleading signals that were inherent in the saw-tooth pattern of 
    typical economic expansions, and it needed to avoid a policy move that 
    would incur an unnecessary risk to the expansion, given uncertainties 
    about the degree to which recent strength in spending would persist. 
    Most of the members concluded that on balance current economic 
    conditions warranted a steady policy course and, in light of 
    prevailing uncertainties, that it would be premature to anticipate any 
    particular policy change or its timing. As a consequence, the members 
    also concluded that the currently unbiased instruction in the 
    directive relating to the direction of possible intermeeting policy 
    changes should be retained; in any case, significant-changes in the 
    outlook requiring policy action were viewed as unlikely in the 
    relatively short period until the next scheduled meeting on December 
    21. One member expressed the differing view that a less accommodative 
    policy would be more consistent over time with the Committee's desire 
    to foster sustained economic expansion and progress toward price 
    stability. However, this member also felt that a policy tightening 
    move at this time might be seen as a response to a stronger economy, 
    rather than an action that clearly was intended to underscore the 
    Committee's commitment to price stability and therefore would elicit a 
    favorable response in intermediate and long-term debt markets.</p>
  <p>With regard to financial developments bearing on the 
    economic outlook and the potential need to adjust monetary policy, 
    members observed that the broader money and credit aggregates had 
    strengthened somewhat since earlier in the year, though to still 
    relatively moderate growth rates. Moreover, much of the acceleration 
    in M2 and M3 could be attributed to special or temporary factors, and 
    according to a staff analysis growth in these aggregates was likely to 
    revert to relatively slow rates in coming months, assuming unchanged 
    reserve conditions. At the same time, growth in M1 and reserves had 
    remained comparatively rapid and in one view such growth might well be 
    indicative of an overly stimulative monetary policy that would promote 
    more inflation over time or at least prove inconsistent with further 
    disinflation.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated their support of a directive that called for 
    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and 
    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 
    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
    of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise 
    by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      some strengthening in the expansion of economic 
      activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll 
      employment rose appreciably in September and October, 
      while the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 
      percent in October. Industrial production increased 
      sharply in October, partly reflecting a continuing 
      rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales 
      were up substantially in October after changing little 
      in September. Housing activity picked up further in 
      the third quarter. The expansion of business capital 
      spending has slowed from a robust pace earlier in the 
      year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in 
      July-August was about unchanged from its average rate 
      in the second quarter. Consumer prices have increased 
      moderately on balance in recent months and producer 
      prices have fallen.</p>
    <p>Most interest rates have increased somewhat since 
      the Committee meeting on September 21. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
      appreciated over the intermeeting period.</p>
    <p>Growth of M2 picked up slightly on balance in 
      September and October, while M3 strengthened to a 
      somewhat greater extent over the two months. For the 
      year through October, M2 and M3 are estimated to have 
      grown at rates a little above the lower end of the 
      Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
      recent months, and for the year through August it is 
      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
      of the Committee's monitoring range.</p>
    <p>The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
      in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
      with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.</p>
    <p>In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
      with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.</p>

    <p><strong>Votes against this action:</strong> None.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Committee approved a temporary increase of $3 billion, to 
    a level of $11 billion, in the limit on changes between Committee 
    meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal 
    agency securities. The increase amended paragraph l(a) of the 
    Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and was effective 
    for the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on 
    December 21, 1993.</p>

  <p>Release of Information about FOMC Meetings</p>
  <p>At this meeting the Committee considered a number of 
    alternatives for releasing detailed information on its deliberations 
    at past and future meetings. Members emphasized that the most 
    important consideration was the preservation of a deliberative process 
    that would enable the Committee to arrive at the best possible 
    monetary policy decisions. Premature release of detailed information, 
    such as transcripts, would sharply curtail the Committee's ability to 
    freely discuss evolving economic and financial trends and alternative 
    policy responses. Moreover, if full transcripts were subject to 
    release before many years had passed, much vital information obtained 
    in confidence could not be discussed in meetings and in any event 
    probably would not be made available by foreign central banks, 
    business firms, and other sources.</p>
  <p>The information for all past meetings and many of the intermeeting telephone consultations was contained in unedited transcripts 
    that had been preserved by the FOMC Secretariat since March 1976. 
    Virtually all the tapes from which these transcripts were typed had 
    been reused to record subsequent meetings and very few tapes currently 
    existed for meetings prior to September 1993.</p>
  <p>In the course of the Committee's discussion, members observed 
    that the purpose of the transcripts had been to assist the FOMC 
    Secretariat in the preparation of minutes that reported the economic 
    and monetary policy discussions and were released after the next 
    meeting. As a result, the transcripts for past meetings had never 
    been edited nor had they been checked by meeting participants for 
    accuracy. It was clear from even a casual perusal that at times the 
    transcripts failed for various reasons to convey an intelligible 
    account of members' comments, and on occasion they even misstated the 
    views that had been expressed. Moreover, most participants at these 
    meetings had not been aware until recently that the transcripts had 
    been preserved and that they could at some point be made public. 
    Their release at this time would represent a sharp break with past 
    practice and would raise an issue of fairness to participants at 
    earlier meetings of the Committee.</p>
  <p>The members generally agreed that their reservations about 
    releasing the transcripts could be mitigated through appropriate 
    safeguards such as withholding particularly sensitive materials and 
    providing for a considerable lapse of time after Committee meetings. 
    They noted in this connection that, while there was no legal 
    requirement to prepare transcripts, the substance of existing 
    transcripts needed to be preserved in accordance with the Federal 
    Records Act. With regard to the manner in which the information might 
    be made public, the Committee considered several alternatives 
    including making available the unedited transcripts themselves, or 
    lightly edited versions of the transcripts, or Memoranda of Discussion 
    comparable to those prepared for meetings prior to late March 1976. 
    The members expressed varying preferences among these alternatives. 
    Some proposed that marginal notations be included with raw or edited 
    transcripts to provide staff explanations or interpretations of 
    unclear or evidently mistranscribed comments. It was understood that 
    preparation of edited transcripts and especially Memoranda of 
    Discussion would require a considerable amount of time and effort 
    before they would be ready for public release. A majority favored the 
    release of lightly edited transcripts that would retain all 
    substantive comments but would allow for grammatical corrections, the 
    smoothing of some sentences to facilitate the understanding, and the 
    correction of obvious transcription errors. The editing would be 
    patterned after that done for Congressional hearings; importantly, no 
    changes would be made in the substance or the intent of the speakers. 
    Prior to release to the public, particularly sensitive materials would 
    be redacted in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of 
    Information Act. The Committee agreed that the FOMC Secretariat 
    should be given responsibility for the editing process and that the 
    Committee itself would not undertake to review these transcripts. It 
    was noted in this respect that many former members of the Committee 
    were no longer available to review their comments and that in any 
    event the passage of time would make it impossible for members to 
    recall precisely what they had said or to verify many of their 
    comments. Accordingly, the edited transcripts could not be regarded 
    as official records of the Committee.</p>
  <p>With respect to the interval between a meeting and release of 
    a lightly edited transcript, all of the Committee members were 
    concerned that the absence of a substantial lag would seriously harm 
    the Committee's ongoing deliberative process. Many also commented 
    that the absence of a substantial lag would be unfair to meeting 
    participants who had been unaware that their remarks would be released 
    and were unable to review the transcripts for accuracy. Various 
    members argued for lags that ranged from 3 years to 10 years or more, 
    but a majority felt that a 5-year lag was necessary in order to 
    prevent harm to the Committee's ongoing deliberations. The other 
    members indicated that a 5-year lag was acceptable because it 
    represented a reasonable balance among the various considerations.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of this discussion, the members agreed 
    unanimously to authorize the preparation of lightly edited transcripts 
    of past meetings and available telephone conferences since late March 
    1976 and to release such transcripts to the public five years after 
    the meetings, subject to the redaction of especially sensitive 
    materials as authorized by the Freedom of Information Act. It was 
    understood that the transcripts for the meetings held during 1988 
    would be edited on a priority basis and released as soon as possible. 
    Providing copies of unedited transcripts for all past meetings and 
    available conference calls to the Chairman or staff of the House 
    Banking Committee in response to a request was not approved by the 
    Committee.</p>
  <p>The members reviewed various options for the release of 
    information about the Committee's deliberations at future meetings. 
    These options included continuing the preparation of the minutes in 
    their current form, which members regarded as providing a complete 
    account of the substance of the Committee's deliberations. Some urged 
    that consideration be given to supplementing the minutes with the 
    prompt release after each meeting of information about Committee 
    decisions. Among other options considered were an expanded version of 
    the current minutes, and the release after an appropriate lag of a 
    lightly edited transcript or a Memorandum of Discussion for each 
    meeting. The members concluded that the complexity of the issues 
    reflected in these alternatives warranted further review by the 
    Committee and accordingly a decision was deferred. It was agreed that 
    the Committee would continue its discussion of these issues at a 
    special meeting during December.</p>
