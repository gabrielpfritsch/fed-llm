Tschinkel and White, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, Cleveland, Atlanta, and New York respectively\n\nMr. Meyer, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on July 5-6, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign\ncurrency transactions during the period July 6, 1995, through August\n21, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these\ntransactions.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period July 6,\n1995, through August 21, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding more rapidly after increasing at a\nsluggish pace in the second quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be\ngrowing at a moderate rate, housing demand seemed to be rebounding\nsharply, and business investment remained on a solid uptrend. With\nefforts to adjust inventories still under way, industrial production\nhad changed little in recent months, and employment gains had been\nmodest. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the\nyear, consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent\nmonths. Advances in labor compensation costs remained subdued.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose further in July after a\nmodest second-quarter gain; the July advance was held down by\ncontinuing employment losses in manufacturing that were widespread by\nindustry. Outside of manufacturing, payrolls continued to increase at\na relatively slow pace in July; reduced job growth in the services\nindustry reflected smaller increases in employment at business and\nhealth service establishments. The civilian unemployment rate rose\nslightly in July, returning to its second-quarter average of 5.7\npercent.\n\nIndustrial production edged higher in July, but it was\nunchanged on balance over the three months ending in July after\ndeclining in earlier months. Manufacturing output fell further in\nJuly; a sharp contraction in the production of motor vehicles and\nparts accounted for the entire decline. Within manufacturing, output\nof business equipment other than motor vehicles continued to advance\nas additional strong gains were recorded in the production of office\nand computing equipment. The output of non-auto consumer goods\nweakened; a cutback in the production of home furnishings offset an\nincrease in the manufacture of appliances. With capacity continuing\nto expand rapidly, total utilization of industrial capacity dropped\nsomewhat further.\n\nDespite edging down in July, revised data for earlier months\nsuggested that total retail sales had risen appreciably on balance\nsince early spring. The July decline entirely reflected weakness in\nmotor vehicles; elsewhere, spending on furniture and appliances\ncontinued to firm, and purchases of other durable goods and of apparel\nrose sharply. Housing market activity picked up considerably in June,\nwith sales of both new and existing homes increasing significantly.\nHousing starts were up strongly in July after changing little in\nprevious months.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods, led by surging\npurchases of computing equipment, continued to grow rapidly in the\nsecond quarter. However, business spending for transportation\nequipment, notably heavy trucks and aircraft, was lackluster. New\norders for nondefense capital goods edged lower in the second quarter\nafter rising sharply early this year, although the elevated level of\norder backlogs pointed to considerable further expansion of spending\non business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential construction\nactivity posted a solid gain in the second quarter, and recent data on\npermits suggested further increases in building activity in coming\nmonths.\n\nBusiness inventory accumulation slowed markedly further in\nJune, and inventory-to-sales ratios for most types of business\nestablishments declined again. In manufacturing, the aggregate\ninventory-to-sales ratio was only a little above the historical low\nreached around the end of 1994. In the wholesale sector, the ratio of\nstocks to sales in June was slightly below the top of the range\nprevailing over the last year. At the retail level, inventories\nchanged little in June, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this\nsector was near the middle of its range for recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened in June, with exports declining marginally more than imports.\nFor the second quarter as a whole, the deficit was substantially\nlarger than in the first quarter. Exports were up considerably in the\nsecond quarter despite declines in automotive products shipped to\nCanada and Mexico, but imports rose by even more, with increases\nwidely spread across most major trade categories. In the major\nforeign industrial countries, economic growth appeared to have ranged\nfrom weak to moderate in the second quarter, and the limited available\nevidence suggested that subdued expansion continued into the third\nquarter. Economic activity remained particularly weak in Japan. In\nEurope, expansion apparently was still under way, though somewhat\nunevenly across countries.\n\nConsumer prices rose more slowly in June and July, with food\nand energy price movements having little effect on the overall index;\nprice increases for nonfood, non-energy items were somewhat smaller\nthan those seen earlier in the year. Over the twelve-month period\nended in July, however, this measure of consumer inflation rose at\nabout the same rate as in the preceding twelve months. Producer\nprices of finished goods edged lower on balance in June and July,\nreflecting substantial declines in prices of finished energy goods.\nExcluding food and energy, producer prices rose by more over the year\nended in July than over the preceding year. At earlier stages of\nproduction, increases in producer prices had diminished sharply in\nrecent months, perhaps suggesting some abatement of pressures on\nproduction capacity and prices. Total hourly compensation for private\nindustry workers increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in\nthe first; however, the rise in compensation costs for the year ended\nin June was smaller than that for the previous year, primarily\nreflecting slower growth in costs of benefits. Average hourly\nearnings grew faster in July than in June; for the year ending in\nJuly, earnings rose somewhat more than in the preceding year.\n\nAt its meeting on July 5-6, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that included a tilt toward possible further\neasing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nImmediately after the meeting, open market operations were\ndirected toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of\nreserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee. Thereafter,\noperations were conducted with a view to maintaining this slightly\nmore accommodative reserve posture, and the federal funds rate\nremained near 5-3/4 percent over the intermeeting interval.\nAdjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above anticipated\nlevels, largely reflecting heavy adjustment borrowing activity on the\nAugust 2 reserve settlement day when demands for excess reserves were\nunexpectedly large.\n\nTreasury yields declined across the maturity spectrum in\nresponse to the announcement of the easing action on July 6; market\nparticipants perceived the policy move as an indication of the Federal\nReserve's concern regarding the state of the economy and, based on\nhistorical precedent, as likely the first in a series of easing steps.\nSubsequently, however, interest rates rebounded in response to\nincoming economic data that were seen as suggesting stronger economic\nperformance and reduced chances for further monetary policy easing.\nOn balance, short-term market interest rates posted mixed changes over\nthe intermeeting period, while intermediate- and long-term rates rose\nappreciably. With unexpectedly favorable corporate earnings reports\noutweighing the effects of higher interest rates, major indexes of\nequity prices were up moderately on balance over the period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated substantially\nover the intermeeting period. The dollar's gain occurred partly in\nresponse to the improving outlook for the U.S. economy and the related\nrise in long-term interest rates in the United States. Declines in\nlong-term yields in the major European industrial countries probably\ncontributed to a higher value of the dollar in terms of the German\nmark and most other European currencies. In addition, the dollar\nappreciated sharply against the Japanese yen, largely in response to\nactions by Japanese authorities to reduce official interest rates, to\nencourage capital outflows from Japan, and to make large intervention\npurchases of dollars during a period when the dollar already was\nrising against the yen.\n\nM2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in July and\nappeared to be expanding considerably further in August. The recent\nstrength of M2 seemed to reflect in part the relatively greater appeal\nof interest rates on M2 assets in the wake of the declines in market\ninterest rates that had taken place this year, particularly at longer\nmaturities. Robust M3 growth was associated with the continuing\nrequirements of commercial banks for additional wholesale funds needed\nto meet persisting strong loan growth. For the year through July, M2\nexpanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995, and M3\ngrew at a rate above its upwardly revised range. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt had been in the upper half of its monitoring range\nin recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth in economic activity would pick up from the weak pace of the\nsecond quarter. The inventory adjustment process appeared to be well\nunder way, and moderate expansion of final sales would be supported by\nthe favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally\nin the debt and equity markets. In response to improved financial\nconditions and balance sheets, consumer spending was anticipated to\nkeep pace with the growth of incomes. Homebuilding was expected to\nstrengthen somewhat in response to the earlier decline in mortgage\nrates and the related improvement in housing affordability.\nAccompanying slower growth of sales and profits, business investment\nin new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very\nrapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital\nand the ready availability of financing would help to sustain\nappreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up\nin response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major\ntrading partners. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the fiscal\noutlook, but the staff continued to anticipate the greater degree of\nfiscal restraint that had been projected at the time of the last\nCommittee meeting. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some\nfurther easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that\nprice inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent\ntrends.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, the members focused on recent indications of\nsome strengthening in the expansion of economic activity after a\nperiod of limited growth during the spring. Further growth in final\ndemand was generating an improvement in overall business activity,\ndespite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had\nexpected. This configuration suggested that the risks of recession or\nan extended period of subpar growth were now reduced, and sustained\nexpansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for\nthe economy. Although the risks to the economy now seemed to be more\nevenly balanced than at the time of the July meeting, they were still\nsizable in both directions. In particular, uncertainties about\nfederal budget policies and their effects on the economy remained\nsubstantial. With respect to prices, members noted that the recent\npause in the expansion had eased pressures on resources, and the\neconomy appeared to be in a better position to accommodate moderate\ngrowth over the forecast horizon without adding to inflation. Indeed,\nsome members were optimistic that growth of the economy at a pace in\nline with their expectations would be consistent with modest further\ndecreases in inflation. Others expressed concern, however, that the\nuncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included\nquestions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the\nprospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nMembers gave particular attention to the ongoing discussions\ninvolving the Congress and the Administration regarding future federal\nbudget deficits. There was a great deal of political support for\nreducing the federal deficit substantially over the years ahead;\nindeed, in the view of one member the political dynamics might very\nwell result in larger reductions than many now anticipated.\nNonetheless, the actual outcome remained particularly uncertain. From\nthe perspective of its macroeconomic stabilization effects and its\nimplications for monetary policy, enactment of legislation involving\nsubstantial fiscal restraint would raise the issue of fiscal drag;\nhowever, the latter's impact on the economy would have to be judged in\nthe context of attendant adjustments in market interest rates and,\nmore broadly, in the light of emerging economic conditions. A\nlegislative package containing strong fiscal restraint measures would\nbe expected to ease pressures in debt markets--indeed, enhanced\nprospects in this regard were probably already contributing to reduced\nlong-term interest rates. On the other hand, a package that included\nonly modest deficit reduction might well lead to upward pressure on\ninterest rates. The continuing uncertainty concerning the size of\nfuture budget deficits might be complicated by a delay in passing\nappropriations legislation in the months ahead, with potentially\ndislocative effects on many federal government operations.\nAccordingly, federal budget developments were seen as the major factor\nlikely to bear on the performance of the economy over coming months\nand quarters, and these developments might well differ considerably\nfrom current forecasts.\n\nMembers described current business conditions across the\nnation as ranging from sluggish in some regions to robust in a number\nof others, with at least some improvement occurring recently in many\nparts of the country. There were anecdotal reports of strengthening\nretail sales in numerous areas, with the notable exception of motor\nvehicles, and of relatively high levels of confidence among consumers\nand many retailers. Sustained growth in consumer spending was seen as\na reasonable expectation for the projection period through 1996.\nHowever, diminished pent-up demands and possibly the increasing level\nof consumer indebtedness would tend to inhibit consumer spending,\nkeeping its growth below that in recent years. These negative factors\nmight be offset to some extent by the wealth effects of the rise in\nstock market prices and by a higher level of housing activity that\nshould help to support demands for household durables.\n\nMembers referred to recent indications, including widespread\nanecdotal reports, of considerable gains in housing activity after a\nperiod of pronounced weakness during the earlier months of the year.\nHomebuyers were reacting favorably to the declines in rates on fixed-rate mortgages from their highs around the turn of the year.\nHomebuilders in a number of areas were reported to be optimistic about\nthe outlook for further gains in housing demand, at least for single-family homes. The prospects for multifamily construction seemed less\npromising; while robust activity characterized such construction in a\nnumber of areas, still high vacancy rates and associated overbuilding\nacross much of the nation suggested little, if any, overall impetus\nfrom this sector of the housing industry.\n\nThe expansion in nonresidential construction was projected to\nslow from its pace in recent quarters in line with more moderate\ngrowth in overall economic activity and reduced pressures on capacity.\nEven so, with the slowing occurring only gradually as projects under\nconstruction were completed, this sector of the economy was expected\nto remain a positive factor in the overall expansion of economic\nactivity over the next several quarters. The members also anticipated\nmore moderate growth in outlays for producers' durable equipment over\nthe forecast horizon in conjunction with slower growth in final sales.\nHowever, current trends pointed to further sizable increases in\noutlays for office and computing equipment, and such expenditures were\nexpected to buttress still considerable overall growth in spending for\nbusiness equipment, though at a pace well below the exceptional rate\nexperienced in recent years.\n\nMembers commented that the adjustment in business inventories\nappeared to have progressed a considerable distance but probably was\nnot yet completed for the business sector as a whole. Nonetheless,\ninventory investment seemed likely to become a more neutral factor in\nits effects on the overall economy as desired inventory ratios were\nreached in an increasing number of industries. The recent tendency\nfor order patterns to stabilize was a tentative indication of such a\ndevelopment. In any event, the recent upturn in final sales, apart\nfrom its probable effects on desired inventory levels, had allowed a\nlarger-than-expected amount of inventory correction to occur without\npreventing the economy from regaining at least moderate expansionary\nmomentum.\n\nThe external sector of the economy remained subject to\nparticular uncertainty. The members generally viewed some improvement\nin the country's net export position as a reasonable expectation, but\nseveral questioned the potential for much expansion of exports to many\nof the nation's important trading partners. While recent policy\nactions in Japan might have diminished concerns about the outlook for\noverall exports, a number of members indicated that they continued to\nanticipate fairly limited growth in foreign demands for U.S. goods and\nservices, with the result that the external sector was likely in their\nview to make a relatively small, if any, contribution to the growth of\nthe domestic economy over the projection period.\n\nMembers generally viewed the near-term outlook for inflation\nas more encouraging than it had appeared to be earlier this year. The\npause in the expansion during the spring had eased pressures on\nresources, as evidenced in part by anecdotal reports of lessening\nlabor shortages in some areas and reduced use of overtime work by some\nfirms, and the higher rate of inflation experienced during the early\nmonths of the year seemed unlikely to persist. The members differed\nsomewhat, however, in their assessment of the longer-term outlook for\ninflation. Some emphasized the reduction that had occurred in\ninflationary pressures, and with labor costs remaining subdued they\nfelt that economic growth in line with current forecasts should prove\ncompatible with moderating inflation over time. Further, the recent\nappreciation of the dollar should contribute marginally to a more\nfavorable inflation outcome after some lag. Other members expressed\nreservations about the prospects for an improved inflation performance\nover coming quarters. They cited indications of persisting\ninflationary expectations such as the recent weakness of the bond\nmarkets and survey results that pointed to expectations of some rise\nin inflation from current levels. They also referred to the\npossibility that favorable labor cost developments would not persist\nindefinitely in an economy that was operating in the vicinity of its\npotential.\n\nTurning to monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead,\nall the members accepted a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of\npressure in reserve markets and to adopt a directive that was not\nbiased in either direction with regard to potential intermeeting\nadjustments. For the near term, current trends in economic activity\nand inflation appeared favorable and likely to remain so with an\nunchanged policy stance. A steady policy also seemed appropriate\npending a clearer assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy. Over\nthe longer term, the members generally believed that consideration\nwould need to be given to an adjustment in the Committee's policy\nstance, especially if substantial fiscal restraint were to be enacted.\nThe extent to which an adjustment might be needed later in the stance\nof monetary policy --characterized by some members as slightly to the\nrestrictive side at least in terms of the inflation-adjusted federal\nfunds rate --would have to be assessed in terms of its consistency\nwith the Committee's continuing objectives of fostering price\nstability and promoting sustained economic growth.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they would vote for a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.\nThey also favored a directive that did not include a presumption about\nthe likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with more moderate growth in M2\nand M3 over the months ahead.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\na strengthening in the expansion of economic activity\nin the current quarter from the weak second-quarter\npace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in June and\nJuly after declining in May; the advance was held down\nby continuing employment losses in manufacturing. The\ncivilian unemployment rate in July was at its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent. Industrial production\nchanged little in recent months after falling earlier\nwhile capacity utilization was down somewhat further.\nTotal retail sales have risen appreciably on balance\nsince early spring, but they edged down in July,\nreflecting weakness in motor vehicles. Housing starts\nwere up sharply in July after changing little in\nprevious months. Orders for nondefense capital goods\nstill point to considerable further expansion of\nspending on business equipment over coming months;\nnonresidential construction has continued to trend\nappreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade\nin goods and services widened in the second quarter\nfrom its average rate in the first quarter. After\nincreasing at elevated rates in the early part of the\nyear, consumer and producer prices have risen more\nslowly in recent months. Advances in labor\ncompensation costs have remained subdued.\n\nShort-term interest rates have posted mixed\nchanges since the Committee meeting on July 5-6, while\nintermediate- and long-term rates have risen appreciably. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies appreciated substantially over the\nintermeeting period, with the gain occurring since the\nbeginning of August.\n\nM2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases\nin July and appeared to be expanding considerably\nfurther in August. For the year through July, M2\nexpanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for\n1995 and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised\nrange. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a\nrate in the upper half of its monitoring range in\nrecent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established\non January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5\npercent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also\nretained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear that it had set for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range\nfor M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to\ntake account of changing intermediation patterns. For\n1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis\nthe same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary\naggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of\nthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with more moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, September 26, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:25 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
