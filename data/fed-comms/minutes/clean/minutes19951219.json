Did not attend portion of meeting covering the monetary policy\ndiscussion.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on November 15, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account,\nconducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and\nPayment Systems as of the close of business on September 29, 1995, was\naccepted.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets during the period November\n15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. There were no System open market\ntransactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period\nNovember 15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal\nuntil December 13, 1996, of the System's regular reciprocal currency\n(\"swap\") arrangement of $3 billion with the Bank of Mexico and the\nSystem's participation in the North American Framework Agreement\nwith the monetary authorities of Canada and Mexico. Both were due to\nterminate on January 31, 1996. The additional temporary $3 billion\nswap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico, approved by the Committee on\nFebruary 1, 1995, would lapse on January 31, 1996, in line with its\noriginal terms.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information available at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion of economic activity had slowed substantially after a strong\ngain in such activity during the third quarter. Data on employment\nand aggregate hours worked since late summer were consistent with\nmoderate further increases in overall economic activity. Industrial\nproduction had changed little on balance after a sizable rise in the\nthird quarter. On the spending side, robust advances in business\nfixed investment continued to provide considerable impetus to the\neconomy. The available information on consumer expenditures pointed\nto somewhat reduced gains in recent months, and indicators of housing\ndemand suggested on balance that activity in housing markets had\ntended to stabilize after several months of considerable\nstrengthening. Consumer prices had risen relatively slowly in recent\nmonths, while increases in labor compensation had remained\ncomparatively subdued.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to grow at a pace\nroughly in line with the expansion of the labor force in recent\nmonths, with gains concentrated in the private service-producing\nsectors. The published information indicated some further declines in\nfactory and government jobs in October and November. Although\naggregate hours of private production workers fell in November, they\nremained appreciably above their average level in the third quarter.\nThe unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent in November, equaling\nits average for the third quarter.\n\nIndustrial production was little changed on balance over\nOctober and November after a sizable increase in the third quarter. A\ndecline in October was largely accounted for by a strike at a major\naircraft manufacturer and that strike, very recently settled, had also\nexerted a slightly depressing effect on production in November.\nProduction of motor vehicles and parts also fell, on net, in October\nand November. Further growth outside the aircraft and motor vehicle\nindustries was paced by continuing strength in the production of\nbusiness equipment. Outside manufacturing, the output of utilities\nwas boosted in November by demand associated with unusually cold\nweather.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was continuing to grow at a rapid\npace, with much of the strength stemming from the persisting and\nvigorous expansion in spending for office and computing equipment.\nHowever, the recent gains in total business investment had moderated\nfrom the extraordinary pace evident in 1994 and early 1995, and they\nalso were less widespread among major categories of business equipment\nthan they had been earlier. New orders for nondefense capital goods\nother than computers and aircraft had leveled out, although shipments\nwere being maintained at high levels by still-large backlogs of\nunfilled orders. Producers of aircraft had received very sizable new\norders recently, but shipments of completed aircraft had been held\nback in recent months by the strike at a major firm. Outlays for\nnonresidential construction were continuing to advance briskly, with\nconstruction of commercial structures posting sizable increases\nrecently. Overall drilling and mining activity also had continued to\nmove higher, led by increased exploration for natural gas.\n\nTotal nominal retail sales rose considerably in November,\nmore than offsetting a drop in October; over the two months, retail\nsales were advancing at a slower pace than the average rate in the\nsecond and third quarters. Much of the November increase reflected\nstrong gains in sales of consumer durables, including improved sales\nof motor vehicles. In the nondurables sector, a sizable rise in\nNovember about reversed a decline in October. Recent surveys of\nconsumer sentiment pointed to generally positive attitudes.\n\nAfter having recorded robust advances during the third\nquarter, most indicators of housing activity suggested little further\nchange more recently. However, considerable strength in mortgage\napplications associated with lower mortgage rates, together with\nsurvey indications of an upturn in house-buying intentions, pointed to\nstrengthening housing construction over coming months. Housing starts\nwere down in October, the latest month for which these data were\navailable, after a large increase in the third quarter.\n\nData for October indicated a sizable accumulation of business\ninventories. In manufacturing, stocks grew at a rate only moderately\nbelow the brisk pace in the third quarter, and the rise continued to\nbe concentrated in the capital goods industries. The aggregate ratio\nof inventories to sales in manufacturing was somewhat above the lows\nin late 1994 and early 1995. In the wholesale sector, a buildup in\nstocks of capital equipment accounted for the bulk of the accumulation\nin October, and the inventory-to-sales ratio in this sector remained\non an uptrend. A sharp rise in retail inventories in October was led\nby a large increase in stocks at auto dealers and at general\nmerchandise and apparel outlets. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the\nretail sector as a whole was at its high for the year, but signs of\noverstocking, apart from motor vehicles, were limited.\n\nAfter having strengthened appreciably in the third quarter,\nfederal government purchases were now lagging and exerting some\nretarding effect on overall economic activity. The decline in federal\npurchases in part represented the transitory effects of government\nshutdowns and the restraining effects of spending cuts imposed by\ncontinuing resolutions and by curtailed appropriations in bills that\nalready had been enacted into law. At the state and local government\nlevels, however, available data pointed to continued, relatively\nstrong growth in purchases.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nchanged little in September (latest data available). Measured on a\nquarterly average basis, however, the deficit declined substantially\nin the third quarter, with the reduction about equally divided between\na rise in the value of exports and a drop in the value of imports.\nIncreases in exports were widespread among the major categories of\ntrade, while reductions in imports were concentrated in categories in\nwhich there had been large gains in the second quarter. Available\ndata pointed to subdued growth in most of the major foreign industrial\ncountries in the second half of 1995.\n\nConsumer prices had risen more slowly on balance in recent\nmonths than they had during the first half of the year. In November,\nthe total index for consumer prices was unchanged, and consumer prices\nexcluding food and energy were up only slightly. In contrast,\nproducer prices of finished goods registered a relatively large\nincrease in November, and the component of this index excluding food\nand energy posted its largest rise since January. At the same time,\nprices of intermediate materials declined a bit further in November.\nAccording to recent survey results, consumers now expected less\ninflation over the year ahead and also over the next five to ten\nyears. The available data on wages and worker benefits continued on\nbalance to display a relatively subdued trend of increases in labor\ncompensation.\n\nAt its meeting on November 15, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a bit above the\nexpected rate of 5-3/4 percent over the period. The bunching of\nsettlements of several Treasury issues that had resulted from debt\nceiling disruptions and the mid-December corporate tax date were among\nthe factors exerting pressure on the funds rate. Most other short-term interest rates fell slightly and longer-term interest rates\nextended earlier declines during the intermeeting period. Market\nexpectations of some easing of monetary policy appeared to be\nreinforced by market interpretations of the incoming information as\nfurther evidence that overall demand would be restrained and that the\nrisks of a pickup in inflationary pressures had diminished. Over the\nintermeeting interval, major indexes of stock prices continued to move\nhigher in concert with the rise in bond prices.\n\nThe sluggish performance of the broad monetary aggregates\nsince August continued in November. Despite the persistence of low\nopportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets, M2 growth was\nrelatively modest in November after a slight contraction in October.\nM3 growth slowed further in November, partly as a result of a shift of\nfunding by borrowers toward capital market instruments to take\nadvantage of lower long-term market rates. Nonetheless, because of\nrobust expansion earlier in the year, M2 remained in the upper half of\nits 1995 range through November and M3 expanded at a rate at the upper\nend of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had\nslowed somewhat in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both\nprivate and federal borrowing, and for 1995 to date, this debt measure\nhad grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly further on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. Declining interest rates in\nseveral major foreign industrial countries, evidently induced by\ndisappointing economic growth in those countries, appeared to have a\nfirming effect on the dollar in relation to European currencies. The\ndollar changed little against the Japanese yen over the period after a\nsharp advance earlier. The Mexican peso appreciated a bit in relation\nto the dollar over the period.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe growth of economic activity would slow substantially from the very\nstrong pace now indicated for the third quarter. Although this\nforecast did not differ significantly from that prepared for the\nNovember meeting, less growth than expected earlier seemed likely in\nthe current quarter. Over the forecast horizon, however, the economy\nwas still projected to expand at a pace that would keep activity close\nto the economy's potential. The forecast anticipated that the\nexpansion in consumer spending would slow a bit in response to\ndiminished gains in disposable income associated with less-rapid\nadvances in spending in other sectors of the economy. The rise that\nhad occurred in the value of financial assets held by households would\nbe a positive factor helping to support consumer spending but one that\nwould be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing\nnumber of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater\naffordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage\nrates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a\nrelatively high level. In the context of reduced growth in sales and\nprofits, business investment in new equipment and structures was\nprojected to increase more moderately after several years of rapid\nadvance. Although indications of excess inventories were limited,\nslower growth in sales and ongoing efforts to reduce inventory costs\nwere projected to lead to smaller increases in stocks over the\nprojection period. Exports were expected to be bolstered to some\nextent by the projected improvement in the economies of major trading\npartners. Although a great deal of uncertainty still surrounded the\nfiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate an appreciable\ndegree of fiscal restraint. Given the projected outlook, rates of\nutilization of labor and capital resources would remain relatively\nhigh, and the underlying trend of price inflation was seen as unlikely\nto change significantly over the projection period.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\ndevelopments, members noted that the information that had become\navailable since the November meeting tended to confirm earlier\nindications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from\nthe brisk pace of the summer months. The members generally agreed\nthat the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate\ngrowth. Expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable\noutcome, associated at least in part with the favorable effects on\nbusiness and consumer spending of lower interest rates, higher equity\nprices, and an ample availability of credit. However, a number of\nmembers expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not\nbe sufficient to support growth near the economy's potential, absent a\npolicy adjustment. One factor that might retard growth was a higher\nlevel of real short-term interest rates owing to the favorable\nperformance of inflation. Members noted that consumer price increases\nhad remained relatively subdued and below expectations in recent\nmonths, despite the generally high levels of utilization of both labor\nand capital resources that had prevailed through much of the year.\nSeveral commented that the effects of new technologies, gains in\nproductivity, global competitive pressures on businesses, and\nrestraint in wage setting might imply that inflation would edge down\nfurther. Others expressed concern that the prospects for further\nreductions in inflation seemed quite limited in the context of\nprojected high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets\nin many parts of the country.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of regional developments,\nmembers reported that anecdotal and other information pertaining to\nregional activity suggested that the moderation in nationwide economic\ngrowth was evident across most of the nation, with the rate of\nexpansion ranging from slow to moderate in different areas of the\ncountry. Overall levels of business activity continued to vary\nwidely, from relatively weak in some areas to comparatively robust in\nothers. Conditions also were uneven across industries, particularly\nin manufacturing, where flagging auto sales and some further inventory\naccumulation contrasted sharply with brisk demand for a range of\nproducers durable goods, notably office and computing equipment, and\nbuilding products. Despite indications that job growth had been\nrelatively limited, labor markets remained tight in many parts of the\ncountry and there were more, albeit still limited, reports of rising\nwage pressures; in some areas, however, labor market conditions\nappeared to have eased somewhat recently.\n\nIn their discussion of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members commented that the data and the anecdotal information\non consumer spending had been mixed. For the holiday season, reports\nindicated that retail sales had been disappointing thus far, though\nsales appeared to be holding up relatively well in some sections of\nthe country and for higher-priced luxury items more generally.\nConsumers had remained very cautious despite considerable promotional\nsales activity, perhaps anticipating even more aggressive markdowns of\nprices as the shopping season neared its end. Members noted that the\nreluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued\njob insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and\ndownsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates,\nand the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. While these\nfactors might be exerting an inhibiting influence on consumers, the\nmembers generally viewed moderate growth in consumer spending as a\nreasonable expectation in the context of further projected expansion\nin disposable incomes. The increase in household wealth associated\nwith the strong performance of the bond and stock markets might tend\nto boost consumer spending relative to disposable incomes, although\none member suggested that the highly concentrated nature of wealth\nholdings might limit any positive effect on aggregate consumption.\nWith regard to housing, members took note of the recent declines in\nsingle-family housing starts and sales after a strong third quarter.\nThey remarked, however, that some of their contacts were anticipating\nthat the declines in mortgage interest rates over recent months to\ntheir current relatively low levels would foster a wave of mortgage\nrefinancing and a pickup in housing demand in the spring.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was expected to grow at a pace\nappreciably less than that observed in recent years but nonetheless to\ncontinue supplying considerable impetus to the expansion. Strong\nprofits and cash flows, along with the ample availability of financing\non attractive terms, were favorable factors in the outlook; on the\nother hand, a weakening trend in final demand, notably in consumer\noutlays, likely would have a negative effect on business capital\nspending. Several members reported that commercial and other\nnonresidential construction activity remained brisk in various regions\naround the nation. A number of members commented on business\ninventory developments. Overall inventories of motor vehicles were on\nthe high side, and inventory accumulation more generally appeared to\nbe running somewhat ahead of sales. There were no indications that\nserious overhangs were emerging, but there were risks that efforts to\nhold down stocks would damp production over the near term.\n\nThe outlook for fiscal policy continued to be clouded by the\nuncertainty surrounding the outcome of the debate between the Congress\nand the Administration. The members anticipated that the result of\nthe debate would be considerable fiscal restraint, but the timing of\ntax and spending initiatives aimed at an eventual balancing of the\nbudget and the extent of the fiscal contraction over time could not be\nforecast with any precision. In the interim, much of the federal\ngovernment was closed, and while federal workers were expected to\nget paid eventually, their spending and that of federal contractors\nmight be damped until the situation was resolved. The members\nbelieved, however, that in light of the plans being put forward, the\nfiscal drag imposed by likely federal budget developments would not be\nunusually large over the next few years.\n\nIn reviewing the outlook for inflation, members referred to\nthe generally favorable price and cost experience of recent months.\nSeveral pointed to subdued increases in labor compensation and to\nanecdotal indications that upward pressures on wages and benefits\nremained scattered despite tightness in many labor markets. In this\nenvironment, and with the economy expected to expand at a\ncomparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members\nanticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite\ncontinuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that\nit might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument\nadvanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the\nrecent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given\ncapacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of\nrapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced\nefficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world,\nand the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices.\nAnother was the possible effect on future wage demands of the lower\ninflation expectations that now prevailed. Although no member saw\ngreater inflation as having a high probability, several did refer to\nrisks in that direction, including the possibility of greater\npressures on resources stemming from faster than currently anticipated\neconomic growth.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members either favored or could accept a slight\neasing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. One argument\ncited in favor of some easing was that the policy stance, as indexed\nby the prevailing real federal funds rate, was becoming somewhat\nrestrictive as inflation and inflationary expectations moderated,\nleaving real short-term rates higher than anticipated. In addition,\nwith markets expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate in coming\nmonths, an unchanged policy was likely to lead to a backup in\nintermediate- and long-term rates. Although there was no sign that a\ncumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get\nunder way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have\nincreased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard\nagainst the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would\nbegin to fall short of the economy's potential, especially with fiscal\npolicy likely to be at least moderately restrictive. In any case, the\nrecent slowing of the economic expansion, combined with the wage and\nprice restraint evident at current levels of resource utilization and\ncontinuing business efforts to expand capacity, suggested that there\nwas little risk of a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the favorable\ninflation experience over the last half year raised the possibility of\ncontinued modest price improvement.\n\nA number of members, though willing to accept a slight\neasing, preferred an unchanged policy stance. While inflation had\nslowed from the elevated pace observed in the early part of the year,\nthere was little hard evidence to indicate that it would decline any\nfurther over the forecast horizon or that there had been a significant\nincrease in the sustainable growth rate of the economy. A few members\nalso expressed concern about the possible repercussions in financial\nmarkets of an easing action that would follow an already strong rally\nin bond and stock prices. In the circumstances, these members\nquestioned whether a somewhat easier policy stance would prove\nconsistent with the Committee's objective of fostering further\nprogress toward price stability. Moreover, although the available\nevidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed, the\nmoderation in economic growth after the third-quarter surge did not\nseem at this time to signal a growing shortfall of the economy from\nits potential. Instead, the economy was likely in this view to\ncontinue to grow at a generally acceptable rate at or near capacity,\nand a few members saw some potential for somewhat faster growth at a\npace that over time could intensify inflationary pressures.\nAccordingly, they preferred to wait for further evidence on inflation\ntrends and the performance of the economy, but they indicated that in\nlight of the uncertainties that were involved and the small amount of\neasing that was proposed they would not dissent from the majority\nposition.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain an\nintermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any\npresumption about the direction of a possible intermeeting change.\nWhile such a change in policy could not be ruled out, the potential\nneed for a further intermeeting policy adjustment appeared remote at\nthis juncture. The risks to the outlook seemed generally in balance,\nand the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of\nsome members.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they favored or could support a directive that\ncalled for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve\nconditions during the intermeeting period but that contained no\npresumption about the likely direction of any intermeeting policy\nchange. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly\nlesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. A staff analysis indicated that the reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth\nof M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\na substantial slowing in the expansion of economic\nactivity after a strong gain in the third quarter.\nNonfarm payroll employment increased further in\nNovember, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up\nto 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little\nchanged on average over October and November after a\nmoderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal\nretail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and\nNovember. Housing starts were down in October after a\nlarge increase in the third quarter. However, orders\nfor nondefense capital goods point to substantial\nexpansion of spending on business equipment in the near\nterm, and nonresidential construction has risen\nappreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and\nconsumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average\nin recent months.\n\nMost market interest rates have declined slightly\nsince the Committee meeting on November 15. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen\nslightly on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nThe substantial moderation in the growth of M2 and\nM3 since midsummer continued in November; however, for\nthe year through November, M2 expanded at a rate in the\nupper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate\nat the upper end of its range. Growth in total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in\nrecent months but for the year to date remains around\nthe midpoint of its monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established\non January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5\npercent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also\nretained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear that it had set for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range\nfor M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to\ntake account of changing intermediation patterns. For\n1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis\nthe same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary\naggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of\nthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions. In\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action : Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday-Wednesday, January 30-31, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
