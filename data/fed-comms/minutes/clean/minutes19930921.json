Lovett and Peter R. Fisher were\nselected to serve at the pleasure of the Committee in the capacities\nof Manager for Domestic Operations, System Open Market Account, and\nManager for Foreign Operations, System Open Market Account respectively, on the understanding that their selection was subject to their\nbeing satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nSecretary's Note: Advice subsequently was received\nthat the selections indicated above were satisfactory\nto the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets and on System transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during the period August 17, 1993, through September 20,\n1993. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nMs. Betsy B. White, Vice President for Domestic Operations of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reported on developments in\ndomestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nAugust 17, 1993, through September 20, 1993. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the formulation of monetary policy for the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed by the Committee at this meeting\nsuggested that economic activity, adjusted for the temporary\ndepressing effects of the flood in the Midwest, was continuing to\nexpand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending was up, and business\npurchases of durable equipment had recorded further healthy gains. On\nthe other hand, housing activity had shown a muted response to the\ndeclines in mortgage rates that had occurred through the spring, and\ngains in manufacturing output and in employment had been limited in\nrecent months. After rising at an accelerated rate in the early part\nof the year, consumer prices had increased more slowly in recent\nmonths and producer prices had fallen.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment edged lower in August after\na sizable gain in July. Hiring in the service-producing sectors,\nespecially in health and business services, was down in August from\nthe pace of recent months, and more jobs were lost in manufacturing.\nConstruction employment also moved lower, retracing part of the July\nincrease. On the other hand, the average workweek rose to a\nrelatively high level in August, and as a result, aggregate hours\nworked by production or nonsupervisory workers were significantly\nabove the second-quarter average. The civilian unemployment rate\ndeclined to 6.7 percent.\n\nIndustrial production posted a further moderate gain in\nAugust. Manufacturing output more than accounted for the increase, as\nstrikes damped mining production and utilities output was unchanged\nfollowing large gains in earlier months. Within manufacturing, the\noutput of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. Excluding the motor\nvehicle component, another sharp gain in computers and related\nelectronic components boosted the production of business equipment,\nwhile the output of consumer goods declined as a result of a\nretrenchment in appliance production following the advance posted in\nJuly. Total utilization of manufacturing capacity edged up again in\nAugust.\n\nTotal retail sales were little changed in real terms in July\nand August. Despite the recent sluggishness, however, real spending\nfor goods in July and August was appreciably above the level in the\nsecond quarter. In addition, real expenditures for services had grown\nrapidly in July; this reflected both high energy consumption\nassociated with unusually hot weather and robust spending for other\nservices. The persistence of hot weather through August suggested\nthat spending on energy services continued at a high level for that\nmonth. After a slight decline in July, housing starts rose\nsubstantially in August. Single-family starts accounted for all of\nthe August increase, as multifamily starts fell further and continued\nto hover around their thirty-year low.\n\nGrowth in real business fixed investment appeared to be\nslowing in the third quarter from the robust pace earlier in the year.\nShipments of nondefense capital goods dropped substantially in July,\nwith all of the decline occurring in the volatile aircraft component.\nFor capital goods other than aircraft and parts, shipments again moved\nhigher in July; while the demand for computing equipment strengthened\nafter dropping off somewhat in the second quarter, shipments of other\ntypes of durable equipment softened. In addition, heavy-truck sales\nwere off substantially in July after advancing steadily since late\n1992, and fleet sales of light vehicles were down in July and August.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures posted its largest advance in\nthree years in the second quarter. However, construction activity\nfell in July in reflection of a sharp decline in the construction of\ncommercial structures other than offices.\n\nBusiness inventories contracted sharply in July after\nchanging little in June. The bulk of the July decline occurred in the\nretail sector and reflected drawdowns in inventories at automobile\ndealerships. Non-auto retail inventories edged down in July; with\nsales flat, the ratio of non-auto inventories to sales remained near\nthe high end of the range for the past several years. In the\nwholesale trade sector, stocks were trimmed somewhat further in July,\nbut the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at the midpoint of its range\nover the past three years. Manufacturing stocks were unchanged in\nJuly after a small reduction in June. With shipments down in July\nowing to weak shipments of aircraft and motor vehicles, the stocks-to-sales ratio rebounded in July but was still at a low level.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit decreased in July,\nbut it remained essentially unchanged from its average rate in the\nsecond quarter. The value of exports edged lower in July, while the\nvalue of imports fell by more, retracing nearly all of the sizable\nJune rise. The decline in imports was primarily in automotive\nproducts, consumer goods, and oil. The performance of the major\nforeign industrial economies continued to present a mixed picture.\nEconomic activity in Japan, after increasing slightly in the first\nquarter, evidenced renewed weakness in the second quarter that\napparently persisted into the third quarter. In western Germany, real\noutput rose in the second quarter, but much of the gain apparently\nstemmed from unintended inventory accumulation. In France and Italy,\neconomic activity appeared to have leveled out in the second quarter\nafter declining earlier. By contrast, both the United Kingdom and\nCanada recorded further modest gains in economic activity.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods fell sharply further in\nAugust; higher prices for consumer foods were more than offset by\nlower prices for the energy and the nonfood, non-energy components of\nthe index. For finished goods other than food and energy, producer\nprices increased over the twelve months ended in August by a\nconsiderably smaller amount than in the previous twelve-month period.\nConsumer prices rose a little faster in August than in July, with an\nincrease in food prices counterbalancing a decline in prices of\nconsumer energy goods. For nonfood, non-energy items, consumer prices\nadvanced over the twelve months ended in August by an amount\ncomparable to that recorded for the twelve months ended in August\n1992. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers\nwere up in August after little change on balance in June and July; the\nrise reflected in part overtime earnings in manufacturing. Over the\ntwelve months ended in August, this measure of earnings increased by\nabout the same amount as in the previous twelve-month period.\n\nAt its meeting on August 17, 1993, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that, in contrast to the two previous\ndirectives, did not include a tilt toward possible firming of reserve\nconditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive\nindicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives\nfor price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser\nreserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.\nThe reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to\nbe consistent with modest growth of M2 and little net change in M3\nover the balance of the third quarter.\n\nOpen market operations were directed during the intermeeting\nperiod toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over\nthe period, while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat\nabove anticipated levels, reflecting demand for adjustment credit by\nbanks experiencing temporary technical difficulties.\n\nOther short-term interest rates were little changed on\nbalance over the intermeeting period, while yields on intermediate-\nand long-term debt obligations declined somewhat. The drop in longer-term yields appeared to be associated with incoming data indicating\ncontinuing sluggishness in economic activity and the more favorable\nperformance of broad measures of prices. Major indexes of stock\nprices increased somewhat further over the intermeeting period,\nevidently reflecting lower bond yields and heavy inflows to stock\nmutual funds.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated on balance\nover the intermeeting period. Much of the dollar's decline reflected\nthe strength of the mark and other European currencies, which was\nrelated in part to the unexpectedly slow pace of monetary easing in\nGermany and other European countries. Against the yen, the dollar\nrebounded early in the intermeeting period from the historical low\nthat occurred around the time of the Committee's August meeting. The\ndollar was buoyed by joint central bank sales of yen against the\ndollar and by the accompanying public statement from the U.S. Treasury\nthat was seen by market participants as signaling a new attitude\ntoward any further appreciation of the yen. On September 21, the\ndollar rose sharply on news that President Yeltsin had dissolved the\nRussian Parliament.\n\nGrowth of M2 continued at a slow rate in August. The\nsluggishness in this aggregate, which occurred despite further rapid\nexpansion in its Ml component, apparently reflected ongoing efforts by\nhouseholds to shift funds away from depository accounts in search of\nbetter returns. M3 turned up after declining in June and July;\nhowever, expansion of this aggregate continued to be held down by\ndeclines in institution-only money market funds. For the year through\nAugust, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates close to the\nlower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for\nthe year through July it was estimated to have increased at a rate in\nthe lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested\nmoderate growth in economic activity and limited reductions in margins\nof unemployed labor and capital through next year. Fiscal restraint,\nuncertainty about other government policies, and slow growth of\nforeign industrial economies over the near term would act as a\nconstraint on the economy. However, improving balance-sheet positions\nand credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on\nspending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further\nincreases in consumer spending, housing construction, and business\nfixed investment. The continued slack in labor and product markets,\ncoupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to\nfoster further reductions in wage and price inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members commented that recent developments had\nnot altered their outlook for moderate and sustained expansion in\neconomic activity. The members acknowledged that the interpretation\nof ongoing developments presented some unusual problems, notably the\ndifficulty of reconciling the appreciable growth in employment thus\nfar this year with the slow expansion in measured output: the\nassociated drop in measured productivity was especially surprising in\nlight of the business drive toward more efficient operations.\nMoreover, the economic outlook clearly remained subject to a variety\nof uncertainties, including potential developments abroad that were\nespecially difficult to predict. Nonetheless, while temporary factors\nwere likely to depress third-quarter expansion, the members saw little\nin the current statistical or anecdotal reports on the domestic\neconomy that pointed to the likelihood of a significant deviation from\na moderate growth trend. It was noted in this connection that the\ninhibiting effects of increased fiscal restraint and expected further\nweakness in net exports needed to be weighed against the favorable\neffects on interest-sensitive spending of considerably reduced\nintermediate- and long-term interest rates and the much improved\nfinancial condition of many business firms and households. With\nregard to the outlook for inflation, some members suggested that the\nprospects for continued slack in resource utilization were consistent\nwith a disinflationary trend, but the disparate factors bearing on the\noutlook for inflation as well as the swings in price performance\nexperienced in recent quarters argued for caution in assessing the\nfuture course of inflation.\n\nIn their review of developments around the nation, members\ncommented that business conditions remained uneven across local areas\nand industries, but they characterized general economic activity in\nmost regions as ranging from little change to moderate growth since\nmid-summer. However, business conditions continued to be quite weak\nin some areas, notably in California, and business sentiment appeared\nto have remained cautious in much of the nation. One member\nemphasized uneven conditions of a different kind. Relatively\ndisadvantaged members of the population, often living in inner cities,\nhad high and rising expectations about their economic prospects. At\nthe same time, however, some traditional paths of upward mobility were\nbeing cut back, such as the military and civil service within the\ngovernment and office jobs more generally. In addition, regulations\naimed at correcting some problems in financial institutions--such as\nreal estate appraisal and downpayment requirements--were having\nunintended adverse effects on lower-income businesses and households,\nand other proposals aimed at promoting minority lending were in danger\nof promising more than they could deliver. An apparently widening gap\nbetween economic realities and aspirations might not have measurable\nimplications for the macroeconomic outlook over short periods of time,\nbut they reflected a worrisome trend in terms of the longer-run health\nof the economy.\n\nIn other comments, members referred to a number of financial\ndevelopments that had favorable implications for sustained economic\nexpansion. Business firms and consumers had made substantial progress\nin strengthening their balance sheets, and while the process of\nadjusting balance sheets evidently was still under way, the material\nimprovement accomplished thus far had diminished financial risks and\nconstraints on spending. Banking institutions had bolstered their\ncapital positions and were in a better position to accommodate\nincreases in loan demand. Bond and stock markets had exhibited\nconsiderable strength. In this connection, however, a few members\ncommented on the apparently growing concern in financial markets that\ncurrent equity prices were high relative to earnings and dividends.\nA correction in U.S. equity markets could trigger cumulative selling,\nespecially by mutual funds, which had garnered substantial new\ninvestors, some of whom might not fully appreciate the risks of their\nnew assets relative to deposits. On the positive side, there were\ngood reasons for optimism on the trajectory of business profits in an\nenvironment of low inflation and moderate growth. Moreover, some\nmanagers of mutual funds reportedly were taking steps to strengthen\nthe liquidity of their portfolios, and members reported on efforts to\nimprove individual investor awareness of the risks of equity\ninvestments.\n\nDuring their review of the prospective performance of key\nsectors of the economy, members gave somewhat mixed reports on retail\nsales in recent weeks, but they generally anticipated that consumer\nspending would provide continued if not strong support to sustained\neconomic expansion. As had been true for an extended period, consumer\nattitudes remained hesitant in the context of concerns about\nemployment and income prospects and, in the case of many consumers\nwith higher incomes, increased income tax liabilities. Some members\nexpressed the view that more vigorous growth in employment might well\noccur as the expansion matured, and such a development would be likely\nto have a favorable effect on consumer attitudes and spending.\n\nCautious attitudes also appeared to have held back housing\ndemand and construction activity despite declines in mortgage interest\nrates. The combination of some further declines in mortgage interest\nrates recently and a tendency for house prices to stabilize or even to\nfirm in some markets seemed to have induced appreciable and widespread\nstrengthening in demand for single-family housing. Indeed, despite\npersisting weakness in some areas, housing markets were described as\nquite strong in many parts of the country, and the overall improvement\nin housing activity might not be captured in the latest statistics.\nOther construction activity appeared on the whole to have bottomed out\nand might have begun to trend higher. Anecdotal reports suggested a\npickup in the volume of commercial property transactions, though\napparently not yet in the prices of commercial properties in most\nareas, and rising construction outlays were anticipated for\ncommercial, industrial, and institutional facilities as economic\nactivity continued to expand. Office construction was likely to\nremain generally depressed as excess capacity continued to be\nabsorbed, but such construction might not decline further. Members\nalso anticipated appreciable further growth in business spending for\nequipment, notably for the purpose of enhancing productivity in an\nenvironment of strong competitive pressures; concurrently, spending to\nexpand capacity seemed likely to remain relatively limited unless\nconsumer spending gathered more momentum in coming quarters than was\nnow anticipated. On balance, business fixed investment was expected\nto continue to provide considerable support to the economic expansion.\n\nThe passage of deficit-reduction legislation in July implied\nincreased fiscal restraint but also appeared to have improved\nconfidence in financial markets and in the business community more\ngenerally regarding the ability of the federal government to enact\nneeded legislation. At the same time, the new taxes stemming from\nthat legislation and a greater focus on the potential for further\nlegislation, notably health care reform and its implications for\nmandated business costs, were a key factor in sustaining cautious\nattitudes among business executives. Members also referred to the\nconstraining effects in many areas, and on the economy more generally,\nof current and prospective cutbacks in defense expenditures, spending\ncurbs by state and local governments, and the outlook for further tax\nincreases by many of these governments.\n\nThe prospects for net exports also were cited as a negative\nfactor in the economic outlook. Expectations of persisting weakness\nin some major foreign economies implied relatively limited growth in\nU.S. exports in a period when moderate expansion in this country was\nlikely to foster somewhat more rapid increases in U.S. imports.\nSome members also commented that the controversial NAFTA legislation\nunder consideration in the Congress continued to dominate business\ndiscussions in parts of the country. It was suggested that whatever\nits eventual benefits for the three nations immediately involved might\nbe, a defeat of that legislation could prove to be a setback for the\nGATT negotiations with dislocative implications for world trade.\n\nMany members referred to the more favorable price developments that had occurred since the early part of the year when key\nmeasures of inflation had surged. While it was premature to conclude\nthat a distinct disinflationary trend had been re-established, the\nmembers generally agreed that price pressures were likely to remain\nsubdued given their projections of some continuing slack in resource\nutilization. Favorable developments tending to support that\nconclusion included the persistence of intensely competitive\nconditions in most markets for goods around the country. The costs of\nmaterials purchased by business firms generally were reported to be\nrising only slowly, if at all. There were indications of fairly tight\nlabor markets in some areas, but wage pressures remained limited even\nin those markets. At the same time, the costs of worker benefits\ncontinued to rise fairly rapidly and many business contacts were\nexpressing concern about the possibility of further mandated cost\nincreases related to the health care reform legislation. For the next\nseveral months, relatively rapid increases in food prices associated\nwith weather-related crop losses and an increase in the excise tax on\ngasoline would tend to boost consumer prices. On balance, these\ndevelopments were not seen as inconsistent with longer-run progress\ntoward price stability, though the inflation outlook remained subject\nto considerable uncertainty.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all of the members agreed that recent economic and\nfinancial developments pointed to the desirability of an unchanged\npolicy stance. The members recognized that neither the pace of the\neconomic expansion nor the uncertain progress toward price stability\nreflected a wholly satisfactory economic performance, but at this\npoint the present posture of monetary policy continued to offer the\nbest promise in their view of promoting sustained economic growth in\nthe context of subdued if not declining inflation.\n\nFrom the perspective of a variety of financial measures, the\ncurrent monetary policy continued quite accommodative. Short-term\ninterest rates were low, indeed close to zero after adjustment for\ninflation, and there had been appreciable further declines in longer-term interest rates. Growth of M2 remained slow, but it had picked up\nsince earlier in the year, and M3 had expanded in August, albeit at a\nsluggish rate, after declining in previous months. One member\nobserved that growth in M2, adjusted to include certain stock and bond\nmutual funds, was estimated to have accelerated since early spring to\na fairly healthy pace. Narrow measures of money and reserves, though\nsubject to a variety of influences, were growing at rates that\nsuggested an ample provision of liquidity to the economy.\n\nIn considering possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, all of the members endorsed a proposal to retain\na symmetrical directive. While current economic uncertainties were\nmirrored in uncertainties about the future course of monetary policy, the members agreed that developments in the period until the next\nmeeting in mid-November were not likely to call for any adjustment to\npolicy. Beyond the nearer term, however, both the timing and, in the\nview of at least some members, the direction of the next policy change\ncould not be foreseen at this time. While they did not see convincing\nevidence that monetary policy was overly stimulative at this point,\nsome members were concerned the current stance, as reflected in short-term interest rates, was quite accommodative and probably would need\nto be firmed at some point. These members stressed the need to remain\nespecially alert to potential inflationary developments against the\nbackground of persisting inflationary expectations and uncertain\nprogress toward price stability. Other members, while sharing this\nconcern to an extent, gave some weight to the possibility that the\nexpansion might remain quite sluggish for a period; under the\ncircumstances, they foresaw the need to maintain an accommodative\npolicy posture and could not rule out the possibility that the next\npolicy move might have to be toward greater monetary stimulus.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated their support of a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff\nanalysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the\nbalance of the year.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity is continuing to expand at a\nmoderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment edged\ndown in August after a sizable gain in July, but the\naverage workweek rose to a relatively high level and\nthe civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent.\nIndustrial production has advanced moderately over\nrecent months. Retail sales changed little in real\nterms in July and August after increasing appreciably\nin the second quarter. Housing starts were down\nslightly in July but rose substantially in August.\nAvailable indicators suggest a slowing in the expansion\nof business capital spending from a robust pace earlier\nin the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade\ndeficit was about unchanged in July from its average\nrate in the second quarter. After rising at an\naccelerated rate in the early part of the year,\nconsumer prices have increased more slowly and producer\nprices have fallen in recent months.\n\nShort-term interest rates have changed little\nsince the Committee meeting on August 17, while yields\non intermediate and long-term debt obligations have\ndeclined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the\ntrade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the\nother G-10 currencies depreciated substantially over\nthe intermeeting period.\n\nM2 continued to expand at a slow rate in August,\nwhile M3 turned up after declining in June and July.\nFor the year through August, M2 and M3 are estimated\nto have grown at rates close to the lower end of the\nCommittee's ranges for the year. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in\nrecent months, and for the year through July it is\nestimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half\nof the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July lowered the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the\nCommittee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary\ngrowth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and\n0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set\nthe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the\nyear.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare.\nLindsey, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and\nMr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, November 16, 1993.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m.\n\nDuring the intermeeting period, available members\nparticipated in three telephone conference calls to discuss issues\nrelating to the release of information about discussions at Federal\nOpen Market Committee meetings. These calls were prompted by hearings\non such issues that were held by the House Committee on Banking,\nFinance, and Urban Affairs. The discussions took into account\ninformation that unedited transcripts for meetings since early 1976\nwere maintained by the FOMC secretariat at the Board of Governors.\nThe members did not reach any decisions on these matters during these\nconferences. In the course of two further telephone conferences\nduring the intermeeting period, the Committee reviewed economic and\nfinancial developments affecting Mexico and discussed various\ncontingencies that might involve the Federal Reserve.\n\nDonald L.
