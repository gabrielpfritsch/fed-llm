Attended portion of meeting on the review of FOMC practices\nwith regard to recording and transcribing FOMC meeting\ndiscussions and the release of information about such\ndiscussions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on September 21, 1993, were approved.\n\nThe Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account,\nconducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and\nPayment Systems as of the close of business on April 30, 1993, was\naccepted.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets during the period since the September\nmeeting. There were no open market transactions in foreign currencies\nfor System account during this period, and thus no vote was required\nof the Committee.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal for\nfurther periods of one year of the System's reciprocal currency\n(\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks and the Bank for\nInternational Settlements.

By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\nand financial outlook and the formulation of monetary policy for the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested some\nstrengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months.\nConsumer spending had picked up: housing activity was quickening; and\nbusiness spending for durable equipment had continued to trend higher,\nthough at a reduced pace. Industrial production, particularly\nmanufacturing, and employment had posted solid gains. At the same\ntime, inflation had remained muted, with consumer prices increasing\nmoderately on balance in recent months and producer prices falling.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in\nSeptember and October after declining slightly in August. Although\njob gains were widespread in October, a large part of the increase was\nin various business services, notably temporary employment agencies.\nIn other categories, construction employment registered its largest\nmonthly rise since last spring, and jobs in manufacturing increased\nafter seven months of declines. The civilian unemployment rate edged\nup to 6.8 percent in October.\n\nIndustrial production rose sharply in October, with manufacturing more than accounting for the increase. Part of the gain in\nmanufacturing reflected a further rebound in the output of motor\nvehicles and parts. Aside from motor vehicles, however, the production of business equipment was lifted by another surge in office and\ncomputing equipment, and the output of consumer goods was boosted by\nstrength in furniture and appliances. Utilization of total industrial\ncapacity rose in October, reaching a level last seen in the fourth\nquarter of 1992.\n\nNominal retail sales were up substantially in October after\nchanging little in September. Sales in October were boosted by a\nturnaround in spending at automobile dealerships and by a surge at\nbuilding materials and supply stores. Sales at other types of retail\noutlets were mixed. Purchases at general merchandise stores were\nbrisk. However, sales at apparel outlets and at furniture and\nappliance stores edged down after rising strongly for several months,\nand the increase in spending at gasoline stations entirely reflected\nthe effects of the new federal gasoline tax on pump prices. Housing\nactivity strengthened further in the third quarter. Starts of single-family homes in August and September were at their highest levels in\nalmost five years; starts of multifamily units also picked up in\nSeptember, although construction activity in this sector remained at a\nvery low level. Sales of new and existing homes moved up further in\nthe third quarter and were especially strong in September.\n\nReal business capital spending increased in the third\nquarter at a considerably slower pace than earlier in the year. The\nslowdown largely reflected a smaller rise in spending for producers'\ndurable equipment, as reduced outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles\nmore than offset continued strong gains in spending for computing\nequipment and other capital goods. Nonresidential construction was\ndown slightly in the third quarter after a sizable advance over the\nfirst half of the year. Office and industrial building activity\nappeared to have bottomed out, but high vacancy rates and declining\nproperty values continued to limit new construction.\n\nBusiness inventories climbed significantly further in\nSeptember; for the third quarter as a whole, however, stocks were\naccumulated at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the\nyear. At the retail level, inventories rebounded in September after\ndeclining on balance over July and August. The ratio of inventories\nto sales for retailing edged up in September but remained near the low\nend of its range over the past year. Inventory accumulation in the\nwholesale sector slowed in September after rising substantially in\nAugust: the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged at\nthe midpoint of its range over the past several years. In\nmanufacturing, stocks dropped in September after changing little over\nthe two previous months; with factory shipments up, the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as whole fell in September to its\nlowest level in recent years.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined further\nin August, but for July and August combined the deficit was about the\nsame as its average rate for the second quarter. The value of both\nexports and imports was slightly lower in July-August than in the\nsecond quarter. The decline in the value of exports primarily\nreflected shortfalls in shipments of aircraft and automotive products,\nand the drop in imports was associated with reduced imports of oil and\nautomotive products. Available data indicated that the performance of\nthe major foreign industrial economies continued to be mixed.\nEconomic activity appeared to have remained weak in Japan in the third\nquarter and to have stagnated in western Germany after increasing\nmoderately in the second quarter. On the other hand, the recessions\nin France and Italy seemed to have bottomed out, and the economies of\nCanada and the United Kingdom to have recovered somewhat further.\n\nProducer prices for finished goods fell in October,\nretracing the small increase in September; excluding the effects of\nhigher prices for finished foods and energy goods, producer prices\nwere down over the September-October period. Over the twelve-month\nperiod ended in October, producer prices for nonfood, non-energy\nfinished goods were fractionally higher on balance, the lowest yearly\nincrease on record for this index, which was introduced in 1973.\nConsumer prices rose in October after being unchanged in September,\nwith the increase partly reflecting the effect of the implementation\nof the new federal gasoline tax. For nonfood, non-energy consumer\nitems, the rise in consumer prices over the twelve months ended in\nOctober was considerably smaller than the rise over the comparable\nperiod ended in October 1992. Labor compensation costs did not show a\ncomparable downtrend. The increase in hourly compensation for private\nindustry workers in the third quarter was about the same as in the\nsecond quarter. For the twelve months ended in September, hourly\ncompensation advanced slightly faster than over the comparable year-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on September 21, 1993, the Committee adopted\na directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of\npressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption\nabout the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the\nintermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and\nM3 over the balance of the year.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above\nanticipated levels as a result of increased demands for adjustment\ncredit associated with quarter-end pressures in financial markets and\nan unexpected swing in the Treasury balance. The federal funds rate\nremained close to 3 percent over the period.\n\nMost other interest rates were up somewhat over the period\nsince the Committee's September meeting. Treasury bill rates rose in\npart because of the Treasury's need to rely more heavily on bill\nissuance in a quarter containing a reduced schedule for auctioning\nlong-term debt. Intermediate- and long-term yields fell in the weeks\nfollowing the September meeting and reached twenty-year lows. These\ndeclines were more than reversed subsequently, however, when investors\ninterpreted incoming data as suggesting stronger economic growth and\ncredit demands over the intermediate term and a somewhat greater\nlikelihood of some tightening of monetary policy. Most indexes of\nstock market prices posted robust gains early in the intermeeting\nperiod, but these gains subsequently were pared back as interest rates\nmoved higher.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated over the\nintermeeting period. The strengthening of the dollar, and the\nassociated rise in U.S. long-term interest rates relative to foreign\nrates, reflected both more optimistic expectations for growth in the\nUnited States and more pessimistic assessments for the course of\neconomic activity in continental Europe and Japan.\n\nM2 registered a relatively strong advance in September, but\ngrowth slowed again in October. The September pickup partly reflected\nan unexpected surge in the volatile overnight repurchase agreement\n(RP) component of M2. Ml also was strong, but the total of time and\nsavings deposits continued to decline, apparently in large part\nbecause of the persisting allure of capital market instruments.\nGrowth of M3 strengthened somewhat more than M2 over the two months,\nreflecting a run-up in institution-only money market funds. For the\nyear through October, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates\na little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent\nmonths, and for the year through September it was estimated to have\nincreased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring\nrange.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested\nthat economic activity, after advancing relatively strongly in the\nfourth quarter, would expand moderately next year, about in line with\nthe potential rate of economic growth over time, and thus would be\nassociated with limited, if any, further reductions in margins of\nunemployed labor and capital. Consumer spending, which had buoyed\ngrowth recently, was expected to expand at the same pace as incomes\nover the year ahead. In addition, fiscal restraint and uncertainty\nabout other government policies would continue to inhibit the\nexpansion, and a sluggish acceleration in foreign industrial economies\npointed to only modest improvement in export demand. However,\nimproving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were\nlifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest\nrates would encourage further increases in business fixed investment\nand housing construction. The continued slack in labor and product\nmarkets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was\nexpected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the economic outlook,\nmembers commented that the economic data and anecdotal reports\nreceived since the September meeting had tended to reinforce their\nearlier forecasts that moderate economic expansion would be sustained.\nAfter a sluggish performance in the first half of the year, overall\neconomic activity had picked up somewhat more in the third quarter\nthan most members had anticipated and available indicators of spending\nand production pointed to relatively robust economic growth in the\ncurrent quarter. Looking ahead to 1994, the members expected the\nexpansion to slow somewhat from its apparent pace over the closing\nmonths of this year. Fluctuations in the rate of quarterly GDP growth\nundoubtedly would occur, but the economy over the year ahead was\nthought likely to continue on a trend of moderate expansion averaging\nclose to the economy's long-run potential or somewhat higher. Most\nmembers saw the probability of a sharp deviation in either direction\nfrom their current forecasts as relatively remote, though a number\nalso believed that any deviation was more likely to be in the\ndirection of somewhat stronger rather than weaker growth. In general,\nmembers expected core inflation to change little or to edge lower next\nyear, but a few saw some danger of marginally higher inflation.\n\nIn their assessment of developments underlying the economic\noutlook, members referred to indications in many areas of some\nstrengthening in business conditions and in related business\nsentiment, though economic activity clearly remained sluggish or even\ndepressed in some parts of the country and overall business attitudes\ncould still be described as cautious. Current financial conditions,\nincluding the strength in equity markets, reduced intermediate- and\nlong-term interest rates, and an apparently improving availability of\nbusiness credit from financial institutions, provided a favorable\nbackdrop for further economic expansion. Moreover, businesses and\nhouseholds had made substantial progress in improving their financial\npositions. These factors were seen as reducing downside risks to the\nexpansion. At the same time, while there were signs of significant\nfirming in the economic expansion, a number of members observed that\nat this point they did not see the usual indications of any near-term\nintensification of inflationary pressures such as general increases in\ncommodity prices, lengthening delivery lead times along with efforts\nto increase inventories, and strong growth of credit. Indeed, the\nrisks of an overheated and inflationary expansion in the near term\nseemed quite limited in light of various constraints on the economy\nsuch as those associated with a restrictive fiscal policy and the\ncontinuing weakness in key export markets.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for specific sectors of the\neconomy, a step-up in consumer spending, notably for motor vehicles\nand housing-related durable goods, had contributed substantially to\nthe strengthening of the economic expansion. Indications of improving\nconsumer confidence, reflected in turn in the growing optimism\nexpressed by business contacts regarding the outlook for holiday\nsales, should help to sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending\nthrough the year-end. Contacts in the motor vehicles industry also\nappeared to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for sales of\nthe new models. The outlook for the consumer sector also was subject\nto some constraining influences. Growth in consumer spending had\ntended to exceed the expansion in consumer incomes and a number of\nmembers questioned the extent to which the acceleration in such\nspending was likely to extend into the new year. The saving rate\nalready was near the low end of its historic range, at least on the\nbasis of current estimates, and was unlikely to decline significantly, if at all. Much would depend on consumers' outlook for\nemployment and incomes. Growing demands should eventually be\ntranslated into faster employment gains, but at this point business\nfirms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite\nincreasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce\nreductions. While net gains in employment, including growth\nassociated with increases in self-employment and new business\nformations, were continuing, expansion in jobs and consumer incomes\nprobably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead. Against\nthis background, members generally expected moderate growth in\nconsumer spending to be maintained, but they did not see such spending\nas likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in\n1994.\n\nThe members anticipated appreciable further expansion in\nbusiness investment spending, especially in the context of reduced\ninterest rates, improved business balance sheets, and ongoing efforts\nto improve productivity. Growth in spending for business equipment\nprobably would continue at a relatively vigorous pace, though perhaps\nsomewhat below the growth rates experienced in recent quarters, and\nother investment activity seemed poised to pick up. In this\nconnection, several members reported that vacancy rates in commercial\noffice buildings were declining in some areas and while this\ndevelopment was not yet being translated into appreciable new\nconstruction, investment funds appeared to be flowing more freely into\ncommercial real estate. Clear indications of strengthening were\nobserved in housing construction in many parts of the country and the\noutlook for such building activity seemed promising in the context of\nreduced mortgage rates and improving consumer sentiment.\n\nFiscal policy developments, including the effects on\nbusiness attitudes of the uncertainties surrounding health care reform\nlegislation, were likely to continue to inhibit the expansion over the\nyear ahead. Some members again emphasized the negative effects that\nthe ongoing retrenchment in defense spending was having on local\neconomies as well as on the economy more generally. On the taxation\nside, the rise in tax liabilities on higher incomes could have an\nespecially pronounced effect during the early months of next year,\ngiven the retroactive inclusion of 1993 incomes subject to the new\ntax, but some members noted that the increased tax payments probably\nhad been widely anticipated and the negative implications for the\neconomy might well be less than many observers expected. Nonetheless,\nthe overall posture of fiscal policy and associated business concerns\nabout the cost implications of possible future legislation were likely\nto be an important factor tending to limit the strength of the\nexpansion.\n\nNet exports were seen as another constraining factor in the\nperformance of the economy next year. On the import side, even\nmoderate expansion in domestic economic activity was likely to\nstimulate appreciable further growth in U. S. demands for foreign\ngoods. At the same time, the prospects for exports to a number of\nmajor industrial countries were not promising, at least for the nearer\nterm, given lagging economies in Europe and Japan. In this connection\na number of members referred to reports of weak export demand for\nspecific U.S. products and also noted that an extended coal mining\nstrike had cut supplies of coal available for export and had induced\nsome domestic firms to turn to imports to help fill their requirements. On the other hand, some markets for U.S. exports, notably\nthose in a number of East Asian nations and some Latin American\ncountries, were likely to continue to experience considerable growth,\nthereby mitigating an otherwise fairly gloomy outlook for exports.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation over the year\nahead, views did not vary greatly among the members. They ranged from\nexpectations of some limited progress toward price stability to\nforecasts of a marginal increase in the core rate of inflation.\nMembers who anticipated a relatively favorable inflation performance\ntended to underscore the likely persistence of appreciable slack in\nlabor and other production resources on the assumption that growth in\noverall economic activity would remain on a moderate trend in line\nwith their forecasts. Some also pointed to the absence of\ninflationary pressures in most commodity markets, the persistence of\nintense competition in local markets across the nation, and the\noutlook for relatively subdued increases in labor costs in part\nbecause of ongoing improvements in productivity. Other members gave\nmore emphasis to the possibility that the economic expansion next\nyear, especially if it turned out on the high side of the range\nencompassing the members' current projections, was more likely to be\nassociated with some upward pressures on costs and prices. In this\nconnection, relatively rapid growth in economic activity, should it\npersist into the early part of next year, probably would trigger\nattempts to raise prices and wages somewhat more rapidly even in the\ncontext of some continuing slack in overall capacity and labor\nutilization. At this point, however, there were no significant\nindications of accelerating inflation and business contacts around the\nnation did not currently see or seem to anticipate increasing\ninflationary pressures.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, the members generally agreed that despite various\nindications of a pickup in economic growth, the underlying economic\nsituation and the outlook for inflation had not changed sufficiently\nto warrant an adjustment in monetary policy. Looking beyond the\nintermeeting period, however, several members commented that the\nCommittee might well have to consider the need to move from the\ncurrently stimulative stance of monetary policy toward a more neutral\npolicy posture, should concerns about rising inflationary pressures\nbegin to be realized. The members recognized the desirability of\ntaking early action to arrest incipient inflationary pressures before\nthey gathered strength, especially given the Committee's commitment\nnot just to resist greater inflation but to foster sustained progress\ntoward price stability. In appropriate circumstances, a prompt policy\nmove also might allay market concerns about inflation with favorable\nimplications for longer-term interest rates and the performance of\ninterest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The members acknowledged\nthat current measures of inflation and anecdotal reports from around\nthe nation did not on the whole suggest an intensification of\ninflation at this point. Moreover, the Committee had to be wary of\nmisleading signals that were inherent in the saw-tooth pattern of\ntypical economic expansions, and it needed to avoid a policy move that\nwould incur an unnecessary risk to the expansion, given uncertainties\nabout the degree to which recent strength in spending would persist.\nMost of the members concluded that on balance current economic\nconditions warranted a steady policy course and, in light of\nprevailing uncertainties, that it would be premature to anticipate any\nparticular policy change or its timing. As a consequence, the members\nalso concluded that the currently unbiased instruction in the\ndirective relating to the direction of possible intermeeting policy\nchanges should be retained; in any case, significant-changes in the\noutlook requiring policy action were viewed as unlikely in the\nrelatively short period until the next scheduled meeting on December\n21. One member expressed the differing view that a less accommodative\npolicy would be more consistent over time with the Committee's desire\nto foster sustained economic expansion and progress toward price\nstability. However, this member also felt that a policy tightening\nmove at this time might be seen as a response to a stronger economy,\nrather than an action that clearly was intended to underscore the\nCommittee's commitment to price stability and therefore would elicit a\nfavorable response in intermediate and long-term debt markets.\n\nWith regard to financial developments bearing on the\neconomic outlook and the potential need to adjust monetary policy,\nmembers observed that the broader money and credit aggregates had\nstrengthened somewhat since earlier in the year, though to still\nrelatively moderate growth rates. Moreover, much of the acceleration\nin M2 and M3 could be attributed to special or temporary factors, and\naccording to a staff analysis growth in these aggregates was likely to\nrevert to relatively slow rates in coming months, assuming unchanged\nreserve conditions. At the same time, growth in M1 and reserves had\nremained comparatively rapid and in one view such growth might well be\nindicative of an overly stimulative monetary policy that would promote\nmore inflation over time or at least prove inconsistent with further\ndisinflation.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated their support of a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmodest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise\nby the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nsome strengthening in the expansion of economic\nactivity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll\nemployment rose appreciably in September and October,\nwhile the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8\npercent in October. Industrial production increased\nsharply in October, partly reflecting a continuing\nrebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales\nwere up substantially in October after changing little\nin September. Housing activity picked up further in\nthe third quarter. The expansion of business capital\nspending has slowed from a robust pace earlier in the\nyear. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in\nJuly-August was about unchanged from its average rate\nin the second quarter. Consumer prices have increased\nmoderately on balance in recent months and producer\nprices have fallen.\n\nMost interest rates have increased somewhat since\nthe Committee meeting on September 21. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies\nappreciated over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 picked up slightly on balance in\nSeptember and October, while M3 strengthened to a\nsomewhat greater extent over the two months. For the\nyear through October, M2 and M3 are estimated to have\ngrown at rates a little above the lower end of the\nCommittee's ranges for the year. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in\nrecent months, and for the year through August it is\nestimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half\nof the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July lowered the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the\nCommittee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary\ngrowth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and\n0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set\nthe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, McTeer. Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and\nMr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nThe Committee approved a temporary increase of $3 billion, to\na level of $11 billion, in the limit on changes between Committee\nmeetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal\nagency securities. The increase amended paragraph l(a) of the\nAuthorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and was effective\nfor the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on\nDecember 21, 1993.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and\nMr. Stern\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nRelease of Information about FOMC Meetings\n\nAt this meeting the Committee considered a number of\nalternatives for releasing detailed information on its deliberations\nat past and future meetings. Members emphasized that the most\nimportant consideration was the preservation of a deliberative process\nthat would enable the Committee to arrive at the best possible\nmonetary policy decisions. Premature release of detailed information,\nsuch as transcripts, would sharply curtail the Committee's ability to\nfreely discuss evolving economic and financial trends and alternative\npolicy responses. Moreover, if full transcripts were subject to\nrelease before many years had passed, much vital information obtained\nin confidence could not be discussed in meetings and in any event\nprobably would not be made available by foreign central banks,\nbusiness firms, and other sources.\n\nThe information for all past meetings and many of the intermeeting telephone consultations was contained in unedited transcripts\nthat had been preserved by the FOMC Secretariat since March 1976.\nVirtually all the tapes from which these transcripts were typed had\nbeen reused to record subsequent meetings and very few tapes currently\nexisted for meetings prior to September 1993.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, members observed\nthat the purpose of the transcripts had been to assist the FOMC\nSecretariat in the preparation of minutes that reported the economic\nand monetary policy discussions and were released after the next\nmeeting. As a result, the transcripts for past meetings had never\nbeen edited nor had they been checked by meeting participants for\naccuracy. It was clear from even a casual perusal that at times the\ntranscripts failed for various reasons to convey an intelligible\naccount of members' comments, and on occasion they even misstated the\nviews that had been expressed. Moreover, most participants at these\nmeetings had not been aware until recently that the transcripts had\nbeen preserved and that they could at some point be made public.\nTheir release at this time would represent a sharp break with past\npractice and would raise an issue of fairness to participants at\nearlier meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe members generally agreed that their reservations about\nreleasing the transcripts could be mitigated through appropriate\nsafeguards such as withholding particularly sensitive materials and\nproviding for a considerable lapse of time after Committee meetings.\nThey noted in this connection that, while there was no legal\nrequirement to prepare transcripts, the substance of existing\ntranscripts needed to be preserved in accordance with the Federal\nRecords Act. With regard to the manner in which the information might\nbe made public, the Committee considered several alternatives\nincluding making available the unedited transcripts themselves, or\nlightly edited versions of the transcripts, or Memoranda of Discussion\ncomparable to those prepared for meetings prior to late March 1976.\nThe members expressed varying preferences among these alternatives.\nSome proposed that marginal notations be included with raw or edited\ntranscripts to provide staff explanations or interpretations of\nunclear or evidently mistranscribed comments. It was understood that\npreparation of edited transcripts and especially Memoranda of\nDiscussion would require a considerable amount of time and effort\nbefore they would be ready for public release. A majority favored the\nrelease of lightly edited transcripts that would retain all\nsubstantive comments but would allow for grammatical corrections, the\nsmoothing of some sentences to facilitate the understanding, and the\ncorrection of obvious transcription errors. The editing would be\npatterned after that done for Congressional hearings; importantly, no\nchanges would be made in the substance or the intent of the speakers.\nPrior to release to the public, particularly sensitive materials would\nbe redacted in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of\nInformation Act. The Committee agreed that the FOMC Secretariat\nshould be given responsibility for the editing process and that the\nCommittee itself would not undertake to review these transcripts. It\nwas noted in this respect that many former members of the Committee\nwere no longer available to review their comments and that in any\nevent the passage of time would make it impossible for members to\nrecall precisely what they had said or to verify many of their\ncomments. Accordingly, the edited transcripts could not be regarded\nas official records of the Committee.\n\nWith respect to the interval between a meeting and release of\na lightly edited transcript, all of the Committee members were\nconcerned that the absence of a substantial lag would seriously harm\nthe Committee's ongoing deliberative process. Many also commented\nthat the absence of a substantial lag would be unfair to meeting\nparticipants who had been unaware that their remarks would be released\nand were unable to review the transcripts for accuracy. Various\nmembers argued for lags that ranged from 3 years to 10 years or more,\nbut a majority felt that a 5-year lag was necessary in order to\nprevent harm to the Committee's ongoing deliberations. The other\nmembers indicated that a 5-year lag was acceptable because it\nrepresented a reasonable balance among the various considerations.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the members agreed\nunanimously to authorize the preparation of lightly edited transcripts\nof past meetings and available telephone conferences since late March\n1976 and to release such transcripts to the public five years after\nthe meetings, subject to the redaction of especially sensitive\nmaterials as authorized by the Freedom of Information Act. It was\nunderstood that the transcripts for the meetings held during 1988\nwould be edited on a priority basis and released as soon as possible.\nProviding copies of unedited transcripts for all past meetings and\navailable conference calls to the Chairman or staff of the House\nBanking Committee in response to a request was not approved by the\nCommittee.\n\nThe members reviewed various options for the release of\ninformation about the Committee's deliberations at future meetings.\nThese options included continuing the preparation of the minutes in\ntheir current form, which members regarded as providing a complete\naccount of the substance of the Committee's deliberations. Some urged\nthat consideration be given to supplementing the minutes with the\nprompt release after each meeting of information about Committee\ndecisions. Among other options considered were an expanded version of\nthe current minutes, and the release after an appropriate lag of a\nlightly edited transcript or a Memorandum of Discussion for each\nmeeting. The members concluded that the complexity of the issues\nreflected in these alternatives warranted further review by the\nCommittee and accordingly a decision was deferred. It was agreed that\nthe Committee would continue its discussion of these issues at a\nspecial meeting during December.\n\nFOMC"
