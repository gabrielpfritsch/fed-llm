Attended portion of meeting relating to a report on a study\nentitled \"Operating Procedures and the Conduct of Monetary Policy:\nConference Proceedings,\" edited by Marvin Goodfriend and David\nSmall. This two-volume study has been designated Working Studies 1,\nParts 1 and 2, of the Federal Reserve Board's Finance and Economic\nDiscussion Series.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on March 23, 1993, were approved.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments in foreign exchange markets and on System transactions in\nforeign currencies during the period March 23, 1993, through May 17,\n1993. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market\ntransactions in government securities and federal agency obligations\nduring the period March 23, 1993, through May 17, 1993. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\npace of the economic expansion had slowed in recent months. Business\noutlays for durable equipment had remained strong, but consumer\nspending had been quite sluggish, reflecting limited gains in\nemployment and real labor income and diminished optimism about near-term economic prospects. Additionally, U.S. exports continued to be\nconstrained by the disappointing performance of the major foreign\nindustrial economies. Available data indicated relatively modest\ngrowth in payroll employment and industrial production over recent\nmonths. Despite the considerable slack in the economy, increases in\nwages and prices had been appreciably larger thus far in 1993 than in\nthe second half of last year.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose only slightly on\nbalance over March and April after registering sizable increases in\nthe first two months of the year. Strong job gains in the services\nindustry, notably in business and health services, were offset in\nconsiderable measure by job losses in manufacturing and construction\nin March and April. In manufacturing, reductions in payrolls were\nwidespread, with particularly large declines at manufacturers of\ntransportation equipment. Construction employment recovered only\npartially in April from the weather-related decline in March. The\ncivilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent.\n\nIndustrial production, after having posted solid gains in\nprevious months, was little changed in March and April. Part of the\nrecent sluggishness reflected a decline in utility output following a\nweather-related runup in February, but manufacturing output also grew\nmore slowly. In the transportation industry, motor vehicle assemblies\nedged down and production of civilian aircraft remained weak over\nMarch and April. Elsewhere, the output of consumer goods other than\nmotor vehicles was about unchanged, and the continuing strength in the\ncomputer industry contrasted with sluggish production of other types\nof business equipment. Total utilization of industrial capacity\nchanged little over the two months.\n\nRetail sales increased substantially in April, reversing the\nweather-related decline in March; automotive dealers reported large\nsales gains in April, and expenditures at other retail outlets\nretraced part of the March decrease. For the year to date, however,\nretail sales had been lackluster after the strong increases of the\nlatter part of 1992. Housing starts picked up in April; both single-family and multifamily starts rebounded from weather-depressed March\nlevels.\n\nBusiness fixed investment advanced further during the first\nquarter of 1993, with another sizable rise in outlays for equipment\noutweighing continued weakness in nonresidential construction.\nShipments of nondefense capital goods during the first quarter were\npaced by another sharp increase in shipments of office and computing\nequipment. By contrast, business spending for transportation\nequipment generally exhibited little strength; although sales of heavy\ntrucks continued to trend up, outlays for complete aircraft apparently\nedged down further. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital\ngoods other than aircraft suggested further expansion in business\nspending for equipment in the near term. Nonresidential construction\nactivity was mixed in the first quarter. Office construction declined\nconsiderably further in response to the depressing effects of a\ncontinuing overhang of unoccupied space. On the other hand, building\nactivity in the public utilities sector continued to trend up, and the\nconstruction of commercial structures other than office buildings\nincreased for a second consecutive quarter.\n\nBusiness inventories appeared to have risen in the first\nquarter. Manufacturing inventories expanded in both February and\nMarch after a series of declines that began early in the fall; much of\nthe recent advance occurred in the durable goods sector, where shipments were strong, and the ratio of inventories to shipments fell for\nmanufacturing as a whole. Wholesale inventories increased appreciably\nin March. However, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector moved\nup only slightly, and it remained near the low end of its range over\nthe past two years. In the retail sector, available data indicated\nthat inventories rose appreciably over January and February but that\nthe inventory-to-sales ratio remained in the narrow range that had\nprevailed over the preceding year.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in February was\nunchanged from its January level, reflecting little change in total\nexports and total imports. For January-February combined, however,\nthe trade deficit was slightly below its average level for the fourth\nquarter, with both exports and imports down considerably from their\nfourth-quarter levels. Much of the drop in exports reflected a\nreversal of an earlier, largely transitory runup in aircraft and\nautomotive products. The decline in imports was spread across all\nmajor trade categories; imports of aircraft and miscellaneous\nindustrial supplies dropped appreciably, and imports of consumer goods\nfell further. Recent indicators pointed to further weakness in\neconomic activity in continental Europe and Japan through the first\nquarter. Elsewhere, the recovery in the United Kingdom appeared to be\nfirming, and growth continued at a modest pace in Canada.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods rose more rapidly in March\nand April, partly as a result of sharp increases in the prices of\nfinished energy goods in March and in the prices of finished foods in\nApril. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices\nadvanced over the first four months of 1993 at a faster pace than in\n1992. At the consumer level, the increase in prices of nonfood, non-energy items over the March-April period was smaller than the outsized change over the first two months of the year; nevertheless,\naveraging over the first four months of the year, the rate of increase\nin consumer prices was higher than in 1992. The deceleration of labor\ncosts also appeared to have stalled in 1993. Average hourly earnings\nof production or nonsupervisory workers had grown more rapidly thus\nfar this year than in 1992, and total hourly compensation of private\nindustry workers rose at a faster pace in the first quarter of 1993\nthan in any quarter of last year.\n\nAt its meeting on March 23, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with a\nresumption of moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the second quarter.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Expected levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing were\nraised during the period in anticipation of some increase in seasonal\nborrowing. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was near or a little\nabove expected levels, except for a surge at the end of the first\nquarter, and the federal funds rate remained close to the 3 percent\nlevel that had prevailed for an extended period.\n\nShort-term interest rates changed little over the period\nsince the March meeting. Long-term rates rose considerably early in\nthe period when a sharp increase in average hourly earnings and some\nupward pressure on commodity prices sparked fears among market\nparticipants of a buildup in inflation pressures. Subsequently,\ndespite growing doubts about the fate of the deficit reduction\nprogram, bond yields declined in response to a series of more\nfavorable readings on price behavior and to indications of a slowing\nof the economic expansion. Adverse news about consumer and producer\nprices rekindled inflation concerns late in the period, and bond rates\nonce again moved higher. On balance, most long-term market rates rose\nsomewhat over the period. Despite unexpectedly favorable earnings\nreports for many firms, major indexes of stock prices were narrowly\nmixed over the period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated\nconsiderably more against the Japanese yen than against the German\nmark. A variety of factors contributed to the dollar's weakness,\nincluding indications of renewed sluggishness in U.S. economic\nactivity, diminished prospects for a fiscal stimulus package, and\nmarket perceptions over much of the intermeeting period of limited\nofficial support for concerted actions to support the dollar against\nthe yen. After falling to a historical low against the yen in late\nApril, the dollar tended to stabilize following Treasury Secretary\nBentsen's clarification of the Administration's exchange rate policy\nand intervention purchases of dollars against yen in a coordinated\noperation. Later in the period, the dollar rose somewhat against\nEuropean currencies as the outlook for economic activity in Europe\nbecame more pessimistic.\n\nM2 contracted slightly on balance over March and April,\nwhile M3 was unchanged over the two months; both monetary aggregates\nincreased substantially in early May. Much of the weakness in M2 over\nthe March-April period owed to a smaller volume of nonwithheld tax\npayments in April of this year that reduced the need for a buildup in\ndeposits to fund these payments. Abstracting from this temporary\ndepressant, weak underlying growth in M2 continued to reflect the\nrelatively attractive returns available on capital market instruments\nsuch as bond and stock mutual funds, which experienced heavy inflows\nduring the two-month period. Total domestic nonfinancial debt\nexpanded somewhat further through March.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested\nthat economic activity would grow at a moderate pace and that such\ngrowth would foster a gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor\nand capital. The projection continued to incorporate the essential\nelements of the Administration's fiscal package, excluding that\nportion of the short-run stimulus initiative that seemed unlikely to\nbe enacted by the Congress. Although the outlook for fiscal policy\nnow seemed somewhat more contractionary than earlier, the sizable\ndeclines in long-term interest rates that had occurred in recent\nmonths were expected to support substantial additional gains in\nbusiness and residential investment. Moreover, the increasingly\nfavorable financial environment associated with expected further\neasing of credit supply constraints and the ongoing strengthening of\nbalance sheets would tend to buttress private spending on housing,\nconsumer durables, and business equipment. Increases in export demand\nwould be damped in the near term by the continuing weakness in the\neconomies of the major industrialized countries. The persisting slack\nin resource utilization was expected to be associated with a return to\nmore subdued price increases after a spurt earlier in the year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, the members focused with some concern on the\nevidence of a slower economic expansion and a higher rate of inflation\nsince late 1992. While recent indicators of economic activity were\ndisappointing, the expansion nonetheless appeared to have sustainable\nmomentum and the members generally viewed moderate growth in line\nwith, or perhaps a bit below, their February forecasts as a reasonable\nexpectation. At the same time, several emphasized that the outlook\nwas subject to substantial uncertainty stemming to an important extent\nfrom the unsettled course of legislation aimed at reducing the federal\ndeficit. Members expressed particular concern about the rise in\nvarious measures of inflation over the past several months. The\nincrease seemed to reflect temporary factors and a worsening in inflationary expectations rather than any significant change in economic\nfundamentals. Accordingly, it was premature in the view of many\nmembers to conclude that the inflationary trend had tilted upward.\nEven so, higher inflation expectations, if sustained, would be\ndetrimental to economic performance, and the risks of an uptrend in\ninflation clearly had increased.\n\nIn their review of business developments across the nation,\nmembers continued to report uneven conditions ranging from apparently\nmoderate gains in some parts of the country to mixed or marginally\ndeclining activity in others. Business confidence had deteriorated\nin many areas and firms were trimming or putting on hold new or\nexpanded spending programs pending a resolution of federal tax and\nspending proposals, including prospective health care reform, and the\noutcome of proposed tax legislation in some states as well. Cautious\nbusiness attitudes were reflected in continuing efforts to constrain\ncosts and to hold down or reduce employment levels, notably of\npermanent workers in light of the large non-wage costs associated with\nfull-time workers. Accordingly, while some job growth was occurring,\nespecially outside major firms and the defense sector, business firms\ngenerally appeared disposed to continue to meet increases in demand\nthrough overtime work and temporary workers, and members anticipated\nthat such attitudes were likely to persist in the absence of a major\nimprovement in business confidence.\n\nAs reflected in the available data for the national economy,\nanecdotal reports from around the country suggested generally lackluster retail sales over the first four months of the year. To an\nextent, this development probably involved some retrenchment in\nconsumer spending following an unsustainable surge during the latter\npart of 1992. In some parts of the country, unusually severe weather\nconditions also had served to hold down retail sales earlier this year\nand recovery from that slowdown had tended to be limited thus far,\nespecially outside the automotive sector. Looking ahead, the members\ncontinued to anticipate that consumer spending would provide moderate\nsupport for a sustained economic expansion.\n\nDespite the cautious business attitudes about the economic\noutlook, spending for business equipment had continued to help\nmaintain the expansion. Encouraged in part by relatively low interest\nrates, receptive financial markets, and the more aggressive lending\npolicies of some depository institutions, many firms were upgrading\nequipment to reduce costs and improve their product offerings.\nConcurrently, however, numerous firms reported that they were holding\noff on making major new investment commitments and in some cases were\nrevising down earlier expansion plans in light of prevailing economic\nuncertainties, notably those generated by the current legislative\ndebate about federal taxes and spending. Nonresidential construction\nremained uneven and on the whole relatively subdued across the nation.\nThe construction of new office structures was likely to stay depressed\nin much of the country as overcapacity continued to be worked down,\nbut members saw indications of some strengthening in industrial and\ncommercial building activity and in public works projects in some\nareas.\n\nTurning to the outlook for the nation's trade balance, some\nmembers referred to quite gloomy assessments from business contacts\nand other sources regarding current economic conditions in a number of\nmajor industrial nations and the associated prospect of little or no\ngrowth in U.S. exports to such countries. While total U.S. exports\nmight continue to expand, reflecting sizable gains in some parts of\nthe world, imports probably would grow at a somewhat faster pace,\ngiven moderate expansion in domestic demand in line with the members'\nexpectations. At the same time, members expressed concern about the\npotential impact of growing protectionist sentiment on current trade\nnegotiations and on the longer-run outlook for domestic industries and\nparts of the country that relied on foreign trade.\n\nWith regard to the inflation situation, members commented\nthat it remained difficult to find a satisfactory explanation for the\nfaster-than-projected increases in price measures thus far this year.\nAlthough temporary anomalies seemed to be involved, including\nmeasurement problems and special factors boosting some prices, higher\ninflation expectations also might have been playing a key role. The\nlatter seemed to have intensified in the last month or two, perhaps as\na result of growing concerns that significant deficit-reduction\nlegislation might not be enacted. Strong competitive pressures in\nmany markets, including competition from foreign producers, still\nappeared to be restraining or precluding price increases by many\nbusiness firms, but efforts to raise prices seemed to be encountering\nsomewhat less resistance recently than earlier in the economic\nexpansion. Some price increases appeared to be associated with the\nearlier surge in demand, and in the case of one key industry higher\nprices had been facilitated by the implementation of import\nrestrictions. The downtrend in labor compensation inflation also\nseemed to have stalled in recent months. Against this background, a\nconsiderable degree of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for\ninflation and the members differed to some extent with regard to the\nmost likely outcome. A number of members, while they did not rule out\nthe possibility of a more favorable result, stressed the risk that a\nfaster rate of inflation might well tend to be sustained. Others gave\nmore emphasis to the still considerable slack in labor and product\nmarkets and to the restrained growth in broad measures of money and\ncredit. In this view, an inflation rate in the quarters ahead more in\nline with their earlier forecasts was still a reasonable expectation\neven though the average rate for the year as a whole was likely to be\nhigher than they had forecast at the start of the year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, many of the members commented that recent price and wage\ndevelopments were troubling but did not point persuasively at this\njuncture toward an extended period of higher inflation. In light of\nunderlying economic and financial conditions, the upturn in inflation\nexpectations and the somewhat quickened pace of inflation might well\nprove to be temporary. The economy was expanding, but the pace had\nslowed in recent months. On the other hand, the potential for a\nsustained increase in the rate of inflation could not be dismissed.\nWaiting too long to counter any emerging uptrend in inflation or\nfurther worsening in inflationary expectations would exacerbate\ninflationary pressures and require more substantial and more disruptive policy moves later. Indeed, in one view sensitive commodity\nprices and other key measures of inflation already indicated the need\nfor a prompt move toward restraint, especially in the context of the\nCommittee's objective of fostering progress toward price stability.\nHowever, the other members all supported a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions at this time.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, the members\ntook account of a staff analysis that pointed to a considerable pickup\nin the growth of M2 and M3 over the months of May and June. Such\nstrengthening, which appeared to have emerged in early May, was\nassociated in part with the reversal of earlier tax-related\ndistortions and with a surge in prepayments of mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Monetary growth was expected to revert to a more modest\npace over subsequent months, and the members recognized that in any\nevent the interpretation of monetary growth rates needed to be\napproached with considerable caution in a period when traditional\nrelationships of such growth to aggregate measures of economic\nperformance were not reliable. In present circumstances, M2 and M3 no\nlonger seemed to be good barometers of underlying liquidity, which\nappeared to be ample. One member expressed the view that the\nrelatively robust growth of M1 and reserves served as a better\nindicator of the thrust of monetary policy than did the broader\nmonetary aggregates.\n\nIn the view of a majority of the members, wage and price\ndevelopments over recent months were sufficiently worrisome to warrant\npositioning policy for a move toward restraint should signs of\nintensifying inflation continue to multiply. In addition to new\ninformation on prices and costs, such signs could include developments\nin markets affected by inflation psychology, such as those for bonds,\nforeign exchange, and sensitive commodities, all of which would need\nto be monitored carefully. These members supported a directive that\nincorporated a greater predilection to tighten than to ease over the\nintermeeting period. Given the special nature of current inflation\nconcerns and attendant uncertainties, however, the Committee agreed\nwith a proposal by the Chairman that an intermeeting consultation\nwould be appropriate in the event that a tightening move were to be\ncontemplated during this period. If a policy tightening action were\nnot needed, an asymmetric directive would nonetheless underscore the\nCommittee's concern about recent inflation readings and its judgment\nthat a policy to encourage progress toward price stability would\npromote sustained economic growth. In the event that a tightening\naction became necessary, such action could help to moderate\ninflationary expectations, with positive implications over time for\nlong-term interest rates and the performance of the economy. Monetary\npolicy would still be stimulative after a modest tightening move in\nthat such a move would leave short-term interest rates close to or\neven below their year-ago levels in real terms, given the interim rise\nin inflation.\n\nSome members preferred to retain a directive that did not\nincorporate a presumption about the likely direction of a change in\npolicy, if any, during the intermeeting period. They were concerned\nthat adopting a biased directive might prove to be an overreaction to\ntemporary factors and to a short-lived upturn in inflationary\nsentiment that was not warranted by underlying economic conditions.\nThey noted that, if called for by intermeeting developments, a move\ntoward restraint could be implemented from a symmetric directive.\nMore fundamentally, they believed that the circumstances surrounding\nthe recent performance of the economy and the uncertainties about\nprice developments suggested the need for considerable caution before\nany policy tightening was implemented and that such a policy move\nshould be carried out only in the light of information that pointed\nclearly to the emergence of higher inflation. Nonetheless, all but\none of these members could accept an asymmetric directive on the\nunderstanding that the Committee would have a chance to discuss any\npossible policy action.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two\nof the members indicated that they preferred or could accept a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible firming\nof reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with appreciable growth in the\nbroader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the economic expansion has slowed in recent\nmonths. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only\nslightly over March and April after registering sizable\nincreases earlier in the year, and the civilian\nunemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent. Industrial\nproduction was little changed in March and April after\nposting solid gains in previous months. Retail sales\nincreased substantially in April but were about\nunchanged on balance for the year to date. Housing\nstarts picked up in April. Incoming data on orders and\nshipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further\nbrisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while\nnonresidential construction has remained soft. The\nnominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January-February was slightly below its average level in the\nfourth quarter. Increases in wages and prices have\nbeen appreciably larger this year than in the second\nhalf of 1992.\n\nShort-term interest rates have changed little\nsince the Committee meeting on March 23 while bond\nyields have risen somewhat. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in\nterms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat\non balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nAfter contracting during the first quarter, M2 was\nunchanged in April while M3 turned up; both aggregates\nincreased substantially in early May. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through\nMarch.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in February established ranges for growth of\nM2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992\nto the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects\nthat developments contributing to unusual velocity\nincreases are likely to persist during the year. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for\nthe year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will\ncontinue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with appreciable growth in the broader\nmonetary aggregates over the second quarter.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nCorrigan, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, McTeer,\nMullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Angell\nand Boehne.\n\nMr. Angell dissented because he believed that the persisting\nindications of rising inflation and the related deterioration in\ninflationary psychology called for a prompt move to tighten monetary\npolicy. In his view, low real interest rates, a very steep yield\ncurve, a surprisingly weak exchange value of the dollar along with the\nconfirming price behavior of inflation-sensitive commodities such as\ngold underscored the need for Committee action to signal the System's\ncontinuing commitment to the eventual achievement of price stability.\nIn his opinion, progress toward lower inflation was not likely in 1993\nand 1994 in the absence of a monetary policy that was sufficiently\nrestrictive to check inflationary expectations. He added that history\ndemonstrated that a monetary policy focused primarily on developments\nin the real economy ran the risk of waiting too long to counter a\nworsening in inflationary expectations and thus requiring more\nsubstantial and possibly more disruptive policy changes later.\n\nMr. Boehne supported a steady policy course, but he\ndissented because he objected to a directive that was biased toward\ntightening. Although recent developments suggested that inflation\nwould be somewhat higher and real growth somewhat lower during the\nyear than had been expected earlier, he did not believe recent data\nindicated a fundamental shift in the outlook for inflation or the\neconomy. He was concerned that adopting a biased directive might\nprove to be an overreaction to temporary factors affecting the\ninflation rate and inflationary sentiment. In his view, underlying\neconomic conditions did not point toward an extended period of higher\ninflation. While the pace of economic growth conceivably could\nquicken, it seemed just as likely that the tempo of business and\nconsumer spending could diminish in the face of uncertainty about the\nstance of fiscal policy, particularly with regard to potential tax\nincreases. Given these uncertainties, he had a strong preference for\nkeeping an open mind about possible Committee action during the\nintermeeting period and, accordingly, favored a balanced policy\ndirective.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 6-7, 1993.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:50 p.m.\n\nNormand Bernard Deputy Secretary\n\nFOMC"
