Fisher was selected to serve at\nthe pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account,\non the understanding that his selection was subject to being\nsatisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open\nMarket Operations shown below was reaffirmed.\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out\nthe most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the\nCommittee:\n\n(b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or\nto acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery\nbasis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at\nmarket discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up\nto nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the\ncurrent shipment of goods between countries or within the United\nStates, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of\ngoods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of\ntrade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their\nlife by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the\nunderlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers\nacceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million;\n\n(c) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are\ndirect obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and\ninterest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers\nacceptances of the types authorized for purchase under l(b) above,\nfrom dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nunder agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or\nacceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless\notherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined\nby competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the\nvolume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the\nevent Government securities or agency issues covered by any such\nagreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement\nor a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred\nto the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the\nevent bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not\nrepurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the\nFederal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.\n\n2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\noperations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs\nthe Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in\nthe System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to\nbanks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements\nconducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as\nthe Committee may specify from time to time.\n\n3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\noperations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments\nfor foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes\nand directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open\nMarket Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and\ninternational accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under\nagreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those\nsecurities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those\navailable on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York\nBank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to\nthe conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in\nparagraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency\nsecurities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase\nagreements between its own account and foreign and international\naccounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such\naccounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a\nservice fee when appropriate.\n\nWith Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Authorization for Foreign\nCurrency Operations shown below was reaffirmed.\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to\nthe extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency\ndirective and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant\nthereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the\nCommittee may issue from time to time:\n\n- Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\n- Swiss francs\n\nB.

To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies\nnot exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open\nposition in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding\nsigns) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in\na single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that\ncurrency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus\noutstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as\nthe sum of these elements with due regard to sign.\n\n2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"\narrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a\nmaximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among\nthose designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign\nBanks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew\nsuch arrangements on maturity:\n\nForeign bank\n\nAmount of arrangement (millions of dollars equivalent)\n\nAustrian National Bank\n\n250\n\nNational Bank of Belgium\n\n1,000\n\nBank of Canada\n\n2,000\n\nNational Bank of Denmark\n\nBank of England\n\n3,000\n\nBank of France\n\nGerman Federal Bank\n\n6,000\n\nBank of Italy\n\nBank of Japan\n\n5,000\n\nBank of Mexico\n\nNetherlands Bank\n\n500\n\nBank of Norway\n\nBank of Sweden\n\n300\n\nSwiss National Bank\n\n4,000\n\nBank for International Settlements:\n\nDollars against Swiss francs\n\n600\n\nDollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs\n\n1,250\n\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the\nproposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall\nbe referred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph\n1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the\nCommittee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of\nproviding an investment return on System holdings of foreign\ncurrencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or\nreceived in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign\ncentral banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.\n\n4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central\nbanks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In\nmaking operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System\nholdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nshall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless\nauthorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or\nunderstandings concerning the administration of the accounts\nmaintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign\nbanks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of\nRegulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the\nCommittee.\n\n5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that\nadequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that\neach currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no\nmore than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration). When\nappropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment\nfacilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities\nmay be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for\nrepurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.\n\n6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs\nshall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and\nthe Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the\nChairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the\nBoard of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman\nmay designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on\nthe Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as\nalternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,\nhis alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the\nrequest of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open\nMarket Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or\ncontemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other\nmatters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any\nmember of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and\nconsultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n7. The Chairman is authorized:\n\nB. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning\nSystem foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary\non policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;\n\nC. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and\ninformation to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary\nand Financial Policies.\n\n8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit\npertinent information on System foreign currency operations to\nappropriate officials of the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\n9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign\ncurrency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3\nG(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to\nForeign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.\n\nWith Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Foreign Currency Directive\nshown below was reaffirmed.\n\n1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be\ndirected at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that\nmarket exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and\nbehavior consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.\n\n2. To achieve this end the System shall:\n\nB. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with\nselected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International\nSettlements.\n\nC. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other\ncountries and with international monetary institutions.\n\n3. Transactions may also be undertaken:\n\nB. To provide means for meeting System and U.S. Treasury\ncommitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of\nthe Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n\nC. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the\nCommittee.\n\n4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:\n\nB. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary\nauthorities; and\n\nC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United\nStates in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange\narrangements under the IMF Article IV.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented in the votes on the Authorization and\nthe Directive because they provide the foundation for foreign exchange\nmarket intervention. He believed that the Federal Reserve's\nparticipation in foreign exchange market intervention compromises its\nability to conduct monetary policy effectively. Because sterilized\nintervention cannot have sustained effects in the absence of\nconforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve participation in\nforeign exchange operations in his view risks one of two undesirable\noutcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is jeopardized\nif the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign\nexchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively, the\ncredibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not\nfollow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions\nconsequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is\nassociated in the mind of the public with the failed operations.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect\nto Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed.\n\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and\ndirection of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the\nAuthorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency\nDirective, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager,\nSystem Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the\nfollowing procedural understandings with respect to consultations and\nclearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and\nthe Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to\nsuch clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the\nSystem's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150\nmillion, or $300 million when the operation is associated with\nrepayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of\ntrading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change\nin the System's net position in that currency might be less than the\nlimits specified in 1.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the\nSubcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the\nfull Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the\nChairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any\noperations that are not of a routine character.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee reduced from $20 billion to\n$5 billion the amount of eligible foreign currencies that the System\nwas prepared to \"warehouse\" for the U.S. Treasury and the Exchange\nStabilization Fund (ESF). Warehousing involves spot purchases of\nforeign currencies from the U.S. Treasury or the ESF and simultaneous\nforward sales of the same currencies to the U.S. Treasury or the ESF\nat the then-current forward market rates. The effect of warehousing\nis to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of the U.S. Treasury and\nthe ESF for financing the purchase of foreign currencies and related\ninternational operations. The agreement had been enlarged from $5\nbillion to $20 billion in early 1995 to facilitate United States\nparticipation in the Multilateral Program to Restore Financial\nStability in Mexico. No use of the warehousing facility had been made\nby the U.S. Treasury or the ESF during this period, and in light of\nMexico's repayment to the U.S. Treasury of all the financing provided\nunder the Program and the termination of that Program, the Committee\nagreed that the size of the warehousing arrangement should revert to\n$5 billion.\n\nThe Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account,\nconducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and\nPayment Systems as of the close of business on October 31, 1996, was\naccepted.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Program for Security of FOMC\nInformation was amended to update the document with regard to certain\nsecurity classifications, access to FOMC information, and attendance\nat FOMC meetings.\n\nOn January 23, 1997, the continuing rules and other standing\ninstructions of the Committee had been distributed with the advice\nthat, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they\nwere being called to the Committee's attention before the February 4-5\norganization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any\nquestions they might have concerning them. Members were asked to\nindicate if they wished to have any of the documents in question\nplaced on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no\nrequests for consideration were received.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on December 17, 1996, were approved. The\nCommittee also discussed its long-standing practice of releasing the\nminutes a few days after the meeting at which they were approved,\nusually on the following Friday. The members agreed with a proposal\nto advance the normal release to Thursday to facilitate the\ndissemination and public understanding of these decisions.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets since the meeting on December\n17, 1996. There were no transactions in foreign currencies for System\naccount during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period December\n18, 1996, through February 4, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager advised the Committee that the anticipated\npattern of reserve needs was such that he might want to add considerably to the System's outright holdings of U.S. government securities\nover the coming intermeeting period. By unanimous vote, the Committee\namended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market\nOperations to raise the limit on intermeeting changes in such holdings\nfrom $8 billion to $12 billion for the period ending with the close of\nbusiness on the date of the next meeting, March 25, 1997.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in\n1997, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\ngrowth of the economy had strengthened markedly in the fourth quarter\nof 1996. To a large extent the gain in final demand during the\nquarter reflected a surge in exports, but consumer spending also\nincreased substantially after having risen at a much reduced pace in\nthe third quarter. Despite some slowing in the growth of business\nfixed investment and some easing in housing activity, the overall\neconomy had expanded briskly as reflected in data on production and\nemployment. The tightness in labor markets had persisted and was\nevidenced by some continued acceleration in labor compensation in the\nfourth quarter. There was no discernible change in the underlying\ntrend in price inflation, although a spurt in energy prices had\nresulted in faster increases in overall consumer and producer prices\nthan in the third quarter.\n\nPrivate payroll employment rose appreciably further in\nDecember after recording sizable increases over October and November.\nThe gains remained widespread among employment categories and\ncontinued to be led by large advances in the services and trade\nindustries. Aggregate hours of private production workers and the\naverage workweek edged higher in the fourth quarter. The civilian\nunemployment rate was unchanged in December at 5.3 percent, its\naverage level for the second half of the year.\n\nIndustrial production increased sharply in November and\nDecember. The gains in December were widely distributed across\nmanufacturing industries, but were held down by a steep decline in the\noutput of utilities after a surge in November. The production of\naircraft and parts extended a strong uptrend. The utilization of\ntotal manufacturing capacity rose considerably further in December, to\na level slightly above its long-term average.\n\nConsumer spending registered a sizable increase over the\nfourth quarter after having grown little during the summer. In\nDecember total nominal retail sales rose considerably following a\nsmall decline in November. The December increases were spread across\nall major categories except for some further decline in sales of\nbuilding materials and supplies. The most recent data on services\nexpenditures pointed to moderate advances in October and November.\nSurveys indicated that consumer confidence had remained elevated in\nlate 1996 and early 1997.\n\nHousing starts fell appreciably in December, evidently\nreflecting unusually adverse weather conditions in several parts of\nthe country, and were down somewhat for the fourth quarter as a whole.\nThe declines were concentrated in single-family units. Permits for\nnew home construction were little changed in December but edged lower\nfor the fourth quarter as a whole. Available data indicated a somewhat slower pace of sales of new and existing homes in the fourth\nquarter.\n\nGrowth of business fixed investment moderated considerably in\nthe fourth quarter after advancing sharply in the previous quarter.\nThe slowdown reflected a small decline in spending on producer durable\nequipment that was more than offset by an apparent surge in outlays\nfor nonresidential structures. Growth in spending on office,\ncomputing, and communications equipment slowed somewhat from the\nthird-quarter pace but remained on a steep uptrend. Business\ninvestment in transportation equipment was weak in the fourth quarter,\nas sales of heavy trucks fell further and work stoppages at a major\nmanufacturer prompted cuts in fleet auto sales in October and\nNovember.\n\nBusiness inventory investment picked up somewhat on average\nin October and November, with most of the increase occurring in\nmanufacturing. Trade inventories increased moderately on balance over\nthe two-month period. Reflecting considerable strength in shipments\nand sales, however, inventory-sales ratios for most industries and\ntrade groupings edged lower from their third-quarter levels.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed considerably in October and November from its rate in the\nthird quarter. Nearly all the improvement was accounted for by a very\nlarge increase in exports of goods and services. The rise was spread\namong all major trade categories except for automotive products.\nEconomic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared\nto have continued to expand at a moderate rate on average in the\nfourth quarter. Available indicators suggested relatively strong\neconomic performances in Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom and\nslower growth in the major continental European countries. Further\nexpansion was reported for several large Latin American and some Asian\neconomies.\n\nRecent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation\ntrends. Overall consumer prices had continued under upward pressure\nin November and December, boosted by large advances in energy prices.\nExcluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose modestly over\nthe two months and increased less over the twelve months ending in\nDecember than over the previous twelve months. At the producer\nlevel, a similar pattern prevailed in prices of finished goods, and\nthere was no evidence of increased price pressures at earlier stages\nof production. Worker compensation as measured by the employment cost\nindex (ECI) and average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose considerably further during the closing months of\n1996. For the year, both measures were up appreciably more than in\n1995, though much of the acceleration in the ECI occurred in the first\nhalf of the year.\n\nAt its meeting on December 17, 1996, the Committee issued a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions. The directive included a bias toward the\npossible firming of reserve conditions to reflect a consensus among\nthe members that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation and\nthat the next policy move was more likely to be toward some tightening\nthan toward easing. In this regard, the directive stated that in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater\nreserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with some slowing of the growth of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period\ncontinued to be directed toward maintaining the existing degree of\npressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate rose briefly in\nresponse to year-end pressures, but it otherwise tended to remain\nclose to the 5-1/4 percent level expected with an unchanged policy\nstance. Other short-term interest rates generally were unchanged to\nslightly higher over the intermeeting period. Rates on intermediate-\nand long-term securities edged higher on balance in reaction to\nincoming data on economic activity that were on the firm side of\nmarket expectations; the increases in such rates appeared to be\ntempered, however, by favorable market reactions to new data on wages\nand prices. The generally positive news on economic growth and\ninflation along with favorable reports on earnings appeared to\nreinforce the optimism of equity market investors, and major indexes\nof stock prices increased markedly further over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose substantially over\nthe intermeeting period. The rise, which was most pronounced against\nthe Japanese yen and continental European currencies, appeared to\nreflect market perceptions of unexpectedly strong economic growth in\nthe United States and a risk of faltering growth in the other\ncountries. The dollar appreciated less against sterling and declined\nsomewhat against the Canadian dollar in apparent response to\nexpectations of relative strength in the economies of those countries.\n\nAfter growing at a considerably faster rate in the fourth\nquarter, M2 and M3 apparently increased at a more moderate but still\nbrisk pace in January. The expansion of both aggregates likely was\nboosted by strong income growth, and the relatively rapid expansion of\nM3 reflected heavy bank reliance on the managed liabilities in M3 to\nfund robust loan growth. From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the\nfourth quarter of 1996, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate near\nthe upper end of the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate\nappreciably above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and was\nestimated to have grown last year at a rate near the midpoint of its\nrange.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion would be sustained at a rate a bit above the economy's\nestimated growth potential. The increase in consumer spending was\nprojected to moderate somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter to\na rate generally in line with the expected rise in disposable income.\nHomebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a\nrelatively high level in the context of continued income growth and\nthe generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.\nBusiness spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand\nless rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of\nsales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external sector were\nexpected to exert small restraining influences on economic activity\nover the year ahead. With resource utilization high and rising,\nconsumer price inflation, as measured by the CPI excluding the\nrelatively volatile food and energy components of the index, was\nforecast to increase slightly this year in the context of some further\npickup in the growth of labor compensation that would include another\nlegislated rise in the federal minimum wage.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the robust performance\nof the economy in the fourth quarter partly reflected some sources of\nstrength, notably a surge in exports, that were evidently temporary,\nand they anticipated substantial moderation in the pace of the\nexpansion over the period ahead. The outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty, but as they assessed the numerous factors bearing on\nprospective developments, the members generally concluded as they had\nat previous meetings that further growth in aggregate demand at a rate\naveraging near or a bit above the economy's potential remained a\nreasonable expectation. Many observed, however, that the risks to\nsuch an outlook appeared to be tilted to the upside. The strength of\nthe expansion in the fourth quarter, and in fact over 1996 as a whole,\nhad heightened concerns that the economy had considerable forward\nmomentum at a time when it was already operating at a level, especially with regard to labor resources, that could tend to generate\nrising inflationary pressures. Indeed, in the view of at least some\nmembers, growth of aggregate demand in line with increases in\npotential output posed a risk of rising price inflation because the\nrecent relatively favorable price performance was seen in this view as\nreflecting at least in part the behavior of special factors that could\ndissipate over the projection horizon.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nestablishes its long-run ranges for the growth of money and debt\naggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank\npresidents not currently serving as members had provided individual\nprojections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of\nunemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1997. The\nforecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had a central tendency\nof 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. The\nprojections of the civilian unemployment rate associated with these\ngrowth expectations were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for\nthe fourth quarter of the year. With regard to nominal GDP growth in\n1997, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent,\nwith an overall range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent. Nearly all the\nmembers anticipated a small decline in the rate of inflation in 1997,\nas measured by the consumer price index, from that recorded in 1996.\nSpecifically, the projections converged on rates of 2-3/4 to 3 percent\nand a full range of 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent in 1997. These forecasts\ntook account of expected developments in the food and energy sectors\nand further technical improvements in the index by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, both of which were expected to trim the reported rate.\nThe projections were based on individual views concerning what would\nbe an appropriate policy over the projection horizon to further\nprogress toward the Committee's goals.\n\nIn their review of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members observed that the available data and anecdotal\ninformation indicated considerable strength in consumer spending in\nrecent months, and they referred to a number of underlying factors\nthat should help to sustain at least moderate further growth in such\nspending. The latter included the solid expansion in employment and\nincomes, the increased financial wealth of many consumers, and the\nhigh level of consumer confidence as indicated by recent surveys.\nHowever, members also cited some factors that would tend to restrain\nthe growth in consumer spending. Among these factors were the effects\nof the high level of consumer debt and rising repayment problems on\nboth the willingness of households to borrow and of financial\nintermediaries to lend, the likely absence of pent-up demands after an\nextended period of expansion, and the possibility of a setback in the\nstock market. It was difficult to evaluate how these differing\nfactors would on balance affect consumer spending, but the members\nconcluded that the consumer sector was likely to provide important\nsupport for sustained economic expansion.\n\nThe growth in business capital spending was expected to\nmoderate somewhat in 1997 in association with slower growth in sales,\nprofits, and cash flows. It also seemed likely after several years of\nrobust investment expenditures that many business firms now had high\nlevels of up-to-date capital stock relative to planned production.\nMembers referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that\nshould continue to support at least moderate further growth in\nbusiness investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing\nrapid technological improvements in computer and communications\nequipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on\nfavorable terms to business firms. Members also reported that\ncommercial building activity had improved in many areas. Some noted a\ntendency to underestimate the strength of overall business investment\nin recent years, including the stimulus provided by efforts to improve\nproductivity in highly competitive markets.\n\nWhile indicators of housing activity had been somewhat\nerratic over the past several months, members sensed a somewhat softer\ntone on balance in this sector of the economy. This assessment was\nsupported by anecdotal observations in several regions across the\ncountry. Against the background of the increase that had occurred\nearlier in mortgage financing costs and forecasts of some slowing in\nthe growth of jobs and incomes, the housing sector was likely to\nweaken slightly over the coming year, but some members commented that\nsurprises on the upside of current forecasts, as in 1996, could not be\nruled out.\n\nFiscal policy and foreign trade also were seen as likely to\nexert some modest restraint on overall economic activity. Federal\npurchases of goods and services still appeared to be on a declining\ntrend. Although fiscal policy negotiations were likely to be\ndifficult and their outcome was uncertain, members felt that there was\nsome basis for anticipating the enactment of further legislation this\nyear to help bring the federal budget into eventual balance. The\nlarge increase in exports in the fourth quarter clearly was associated\nwith temporary developments, and net exports were expected to weaken\nthis year, reflecting both some reversal of recent developments and\nthe earlier appreciation of the dollar. Some members reported that\nbusiness contacts had already communicated concerns about increased\ncompetitive pressures from imports because of the rise in the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar.\n\nMembers commented that inflation had remained remarkably\nsubdued, but they expressed considerable concern about the risks of\nrising inflation in the context of high levels of resource use. They\nreferred in particular to statistical indications, supported by\nanecdotal reports from around the nation, of very tight conditions in\nlabor markets and some upward pressures on wages. Thus far, the rise\nin compensation had been held down by diminishing increases in worker\nbenefit costs, and productivity gains also appeared to have had a\nfavorable effect on unit labor costs. In addition, the increases in\nwages themselves had continued to be restrained by apparent worker\nconcerns about job security. To date, there was no evidence that\npressures stemming from tight labor markets had been passed through to\na measurable extent to higher prices.\n\nWhile the absence of increasing price inflation was a welcome\ndevelopment, members were concerned that the break with historical\npatterns might not persist. If labor markets remained under pressure,\nnominal compensation costs were likely to pick up at some point as\none-time savings in worker benefit costs ran out and as workers became\nless willing to trade off lower wages for increased security; such a\ndevelopment would foster increases in labor costs that ultimately\nwould feed through to higher prices. The members did not anticipate a\nsudden surge in inflation, but many expressed concern about the\npossibility of a gradual upcreep in coming quarters that might become\nmore considerable later. They generally expected a small decline in\noverall price inflation this year, reflecting favorable developments\nin food and energy and, for the CPI, further technical improvements by\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics; however, they believed that the risks\nto their forecasts were in the direction of greater inflation and\nseveral noted in particular that projected declines in energy prices\nmight not materialize as soon or to the extent assumed in many\nforecasts.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nreviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in\n1997 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in\nJuly 1996. Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2\nand 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for\n1997. The tentative ranges for 1997 were unchanged from the actual\nranges adopted for 1995 (in July of that year for M3) and 1996.\n\nIn reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a\nstaff projection indicating that M2 and M3 likely would grow in 1997\nat rates close to the upper limit of those ranges, given the\nCommittee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices\nand assuming no major changes in interest rates. The staff analysis\nanticipated that the velocities of the broad monetary aggregates would\ncontinue to behave in the relatively stable and predictable manner\nthat had re-emerged in the last few years and that was closer to\nhistorical norms than had been the case in the early 1990s.\n\nThe greater measure of predictability in velocity recently\nwas an encouraging development, but in view of the substantial changes\nin financial markets and the increased availability of investment\nalternatives it would be premature to assume that the pattern would\nnecessarily continue going forward. Given the substantial uncertainty\nstill attached to projections of money growth consistent with the\nCommittee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed\nthat there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in\nJuly 1996. Adopting higher ranges, which would be more closely\ncentered on money growth thought likely to be consistent with the\nCommittee's expectations for economic activity and prices, could be\nmisinterpreted as indicating that the Committee had become much more\nconfident of the predictability of velocity and was placing greater\nemphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy. One\nmember, while agreeing with this assessment, emphasized that a\ncontinuation of a stable and predictable pattern of velocity behavior\nwould raise the question as to whether the Committee should return to\nsetting ranges consistent with its expectations for economic\ndevelopments. Nonetheless, from a longer-run perspective, the\ntentative ranges readily encompass rates of growth of M2 and M3 that,\nif velocity were to behave in line with historical experience, could\nbe expected to be associated with approximate price stability and a\nsustainable rate of real economic growth. In that regard, they\ncontinue to serve the useful purpose of benchmarking money growth\nconsistent with the Committee's long-run goal of price stability.\n\nAt the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee voted to\napprove without change the tentative ranges for 1997 that it had\nestablished in July of last year. In keeping with its usual\nprocedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review\nits ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in\nlight of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and\nongoing economic and financial developments. Accordingly, the\nfollowing statement of longer-run policy for 1997 was approved for\ninclusion in the domestic policy directive:\n\n: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow,\nParry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\n: None.\n\nAbsent and not voting : Mr. Lindsey and Ms.\nYellen.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to\nmaintain an unchanged policy stance; the members also strongly\nsupported the retention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged\npolicy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent, with few\nsigns of emerging price pressures, with growth in economic activity\nseen as likely to moderate appreciably from the unexpectedly strong\nand unsustainable pace of the fourth quarter, and with considerable\nuncertainty about future inflationary developments. However, the\nmembers emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic\nexpansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater,\ntightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in\nworker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added\nupward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price\ninflation over time. Even so, most members thought that inflation\nlikely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any\nstrengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual,\nallowing the Committee to respond in a timely manner. Several also\ncommented that a tightening policy action was not generally\nanticipated in financial markets, and a move at this time could have\nexaggerated repercussions. A few members emphasized, however, that\nthe recent surge in economic activity had raised the probability that\nthe level of economic output was now above the economy's long-run\npotential, and without a significant slowing in economic growth,\ninflationary pressures were more likely to increase over the forecast\nhorizon. While an immediate tightening of policy would help to\nforestall such a buildup of pressures, the members agreed that current\nuncertainties about the outlook for both the rate of expansion and\ninflation warranted a continuing \"wait and see\" policy stance, or at\nleast made such a policy acceptable at this juncture.\n\nIn their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period, the members recognized that an asymmetric\ndirective tilted toward tightening was consistent with their general\nview that the risks were now more clearly in the direction of an\nupward trend in inflation. They agreed that the current environment\ncalled for careful monitoring of new developments and for prompt\naction by the Committee to counter any tendency for price inflation to\nrise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in\nfinancial markets and economic decision-making more generally.\nIndeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable\ngrowth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any\nsign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have changed little or\nrisen slightly since the Committee meeting on December\n17, 1996. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies has increased substantially over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in the\nfourth quarter and appeared to have continued at a fairly\nbrisk, though diminished, pace in January. From the\nfourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2\nis estimated to have grown near the upper end of the\nCommittee's annual range and M3 well above the top of its\nrange. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded\nmoderately on balance over recent months and is estimated\nto have grown last year near the midpoint of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent\nand 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nsome moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, March 25, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 11:35 a.m.\n\nAttended Tuesday session only.\n\nAttended portions of meeting relating to the Committee's review of\nthe economic outlook and establishment of its monetary and debt\nranges for 1997."
