Geithner had been elected\nby the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a member of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee for the period commencing November 14,\n2003, and ending December 31, 2003, and that he had executed his oath\nof office.\n\nBy unanimous vote, Timothy F. Geithner was elected to serve as Vice Chairman\nuntil the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee after December\n31, 2003, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance\nof his official connection with a Federal Reserve Bank or the Board of\nGovernors, he would cease to have any official connection to the Committee.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments\nin foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign\ncurrencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets\nand on System open market transactions in government securities and securities\nissued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period October\n28, 2003, through December 8, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nReal GDP appeared to be advancing at a solid rate in the fourth quarter,\nalbeit well below its extraordinary pace in the third quarter. Consumer\nspending appeared to be on a flatter trajectory, but spending for equipment\nand software and residential construction continued to surge. Meanwhile,\nthe labor market had finally shown signs of some improvement in recent\nmonths, and activity in the industrial sector was continuing to rise.\nConsumer price inflation remained quiescent: The twelve-month change in\ncore consumer prices was notably lower than the increase during the preceding\nyear.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payrolls rose moderately in November, although by less\nthan the substantial gains in September and October. The increases in\nNovember were fairly widespread, with notable advances in temporary help\nservices, nonbusiness services, and construction. Although employment\ncontinued to fall in manufacturing, the losses had tapered off since the\nfirst half of the year. The average workweek and aggregate hours worked\nby nonfarm employees increased significantly, and the average level of\nnonfarm employee hours in October and November was noticeably above the\naverage in the third quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent\nin November, down from a recent peak of 6.4 percent at midyear.\n\nIndustrial production grew solidly in the third quarter, and the momentum\ncontinued in October apart from the production of motor vehicles and parts,\nwhich fell back from an elevated third-quarter level. High-tech output\naccelerated in the third quarter to the fastest pace since the middle\nof 2000, and production gains continued at a rapid pace in October. Outside\nthe manufacturing sector, unseasonably warm weather contributed to an\nincrease in output at utilities in October, while mining production declined\na bit, largely reflecting a decrease in the production of crude oil. Capacity\nutilization edged up in October but remained well below its longer-term\naverage.\n\nConsumer spending slipped a little on balance in September and October\nafter soaring in July and August. Much of the recent decline was the result\nof a pullback in purchases of motor vehicles; elsewhere, expenditures\nwere about unchanged in September and rose modestly in October. Spending\nwas supported by the upturn in employment, continued impetus from the\nrecently enacted tax cuts, improved confidence, and a level of wealth\nthat was considerably above that of earlier in the year.\n\nHousing activity surged in October. Single-family housing starts reached\na record high, while multifamily starts moved down but remained in line\nwith the average pace during the previous two years. Sales of existing\nsingle-family homes in October were only a bit below the record level\nset in September. The pace of new home sales also remained brisk in October,\nalbeit down somewhat from September.\n\nThe data on orders for, and shipments of, nondefense capital goods through\nOctober suggested continued momentum in spending on equipment and software,\nwhich grew in the third quarter at the fastest pace since 1998. Robust\ngains in spending were posted in the third quarter in all the major categories\nexcept aircraft. The gains were associated with recent increases in business\noutput and corporate cash flow and with a decline this year in the user\ncost of capital. Shipments of high-tech equipment climbed further in October,\nwhile shipments in other nondefense sectors excluding aircraft edged down.\nNew orders of nondefense equipment excluding aircraft in October continued\nthe upward trend in place since the beginning of the year and were consistent\nwith ongoing gains in equipment spending. Outlays for the construction\nof private-sector nonresidential buildings fell a bit in October, but\nthe extended contraction in spending on nonresidential construction appeared\nto be ending. Nominal spending on office space edged up in September and\nOctober, while outlays for the construction of other commercial buildings\nmoved lower. Expenditures on institutional buildings changed little in\nrecent months.\n\nReal nonfarm inventories fell moderately in the third quarter after declining\nsubstantially in the second. Manufacturers liquidated stocks by a larger\namount in the third quarter than in the previous quarter but added slightly\nto their inventories in October. Wholesalers and retailers (excluding\nthose selling motor vehicles and parts) built up inventories in the third\nquarter, and, for wholesalers, the stockbuilding continued in October\n(data on retail inventories in October were unavailable). Still, inventory-sales\nratios in all three categories declined a bit further in the third quarter\nfrom already very low levels.\n\nThe international trade deficit increased in September as imports of\ngoods and services rose more than exports. Recent data suggested that\na recovery had taken hold in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth\nin real GDP picked up in the third quarter in the euro area, the United\nKingdom, and Canada, and indicators in Japan were consistent with continued\neconomic expansion.\n\nCore consumer price inflation remained subdued in October, although it\nwas up from even lower levels in the first part of the year, when it was\ndepressed by transitory factors. Over the twelve months ending in October,\ncore consumer prices rose only slightly and noticeably less than in the\nprevious twelve-month period. Total twelve-month consumer inflation was\nunchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices.\nProducer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually\nlarge increases in October, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the\nprices of motor vehicles. Twelve-month core producer price inflation,\nhowever, was on balance unchanged over the year ending October, although\nthe twelve-month change in overall producer prices stood well above its\nyear-earlier level owing to a jump in food and energy price inflation.\nWith regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production\nor nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose slightly in\nthe twelve months ending in November; the increase was a bit below that\nin the previous twelve months. By contrast, the increase in the employment\ncost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve\nmonths ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting\na pickup in benefit costs.\n\nAt its meeting of October 28, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee\nadopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve\nmarkets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.\nIn reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the\nupside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for\nthe next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability,\nthough minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a\nrise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judged that,\non balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remained the\npredominant concern for the foreseeable future. In those circumstances,\nthe Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for\na considerable period.\n\nThe Committee's decision at the October meeting to leave its target for\nthe federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, and rates\non near-dated federal funds futures were virtually unchanged. However,\nthe Committee's retention of both an unchanged risk assessment and its\nindication that policy could remain accommodative for a considerable period,\nwhich market participants apparently had seen as less certain outcomes,\nprecipitated a brief rally in Treasury markets. Over the intermeeting\nperiod as a whole, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields were\nbasically unchanged. Upward movements in response to data releases showing\nan economy building momentum were offset by the market response to several\nstatements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain accommodative\nand to the November employment report, which included a smaller gain in\nprivate nonfarm payrolls than market participants had expected. Yields\non investment-grade corporate securities were also essentially unchanged,\nwhile yields on speculative-grade securities declined, continuing the\nnarrowing of their risk spreads. Major equity indexes were up moderately\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nThe exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies\nindex, declined somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar\nhad appreciated in late October and early November following several stronger-than-expected\nU.S. economic data releases. But the dollar depreciated, on net, over\nthe remainder of the intermeeting period, reflecting concerns about an\nescalation of trade frictions prompted by the U.S. imposition of import\nquotas on Chinese textiles, the ability of the United States to continue\nto finance its current account deficit, and risks stemming from developments\nin Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey.\n\nM2 contracted significantly in November for the third consecutive month.\nA sizable part of the declines in these three months appeared to be due\nto the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and the resulting reductions\nin associated deposit balances. In addition, rising equity markets may\nhave made M2 accounts relatively less attractive.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the economic\nexpansion was likely to be sufficiently robust to reduce economic slack\nsubstantially in coming quarters. Accommodative financial conditions,\nfiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would\ncontinue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending\nover the months ahead. In addition, businesses appeared to be shedding\nsome of the caution that had characterized their behavior for the previous\nthree years. As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher,\nthe liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening\nof capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data\nwere projected to continue. Even though the unemployment rate was projected\nto decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core\nconsumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing\nslack in resource utilization.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments,\nmembers referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic\nexpansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched. The members noted\nthat spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of\ntax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane. And with business confidence\non the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had\nrevived. While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of\nthe expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected\ngrowth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets\nover the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors\nsupporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies,\naccommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence,\na rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker\ndollar and pickup in growth abroad. While downside risks to the outlook\nhad diminished, some members remained concerned that spending could slow\nsomewhat next year as the effects of fiscal stimulus and mortgage refinancing\nfaded. Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and\nso weigh on consumer confidence. With relatively strong economic growth\nnonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation\nas more nearly balanced than earlier in the year.\n\nIn their comments about recent developments around the nation, members\nreported improving economic conditions in virtually all regions, with\nstrength in household spending increasingly augmented by gains in business\noutlays. Consumer spending remained firm, and residential construction\ncontinued at a high level. Committee members' business contacts generally\nexpressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained,\nand they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment\ngoing forward. Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in\nthe rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors\nand employment displayed signs of stabilizing. Some members reported an\neasing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal\nreports suggested that competition, including especially competition from\nforeign producers, continued to constrain pricing.\n\nIn their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the\neconomy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in\nbusiness spending in recent quarters would continue. It now appeared that\nthe increase in outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter\nwas even larger than had been thought, and data on orders and shipments,\nas well as anecdotal reports, pointed to further increases. These gains\nowed to rising business confidence, substantial gains in profits and cash\nflow, and accommodative financial markets. In addition, businesses were\nexpected to step up investment outlays next year in advance of the expiration\nof temporary tax incentives. Some members noted that the commercial real\nestate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling\nrents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted\ndemand for office and retail space.\n\nAn easing of business caution was also suggested by growing indications\nthat business firms were shifting from inventory liquidation to restocking.\nWith the level of inventories still quite low relative to sales and sales\nexpected to strengthen further, a number of members noted that inventory\ninvestment could be expected to contribute to growth in aggregate demand\nin coming quarters.\n\nHousehold spending had remained solid even as the effects of tax refunds\nand mortgage refinancing, which had boosted spending substantially in\nthe summer, waned. While consumption spending had slowed earlier in the\nfall, retail contacts suggested some strengthening more recently and reported\nthat holiday sales appeared to be running somewhat above last year's pace.\nLooking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported\nby further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in\nthe first half of next year. And with the expansion picking up momentum,\nthe risk of a slowdown in such spending clearly seemed to have diminished.\nSome members pointed, however, to signs of increased financial stress\nthat could limit the ability of many households to hold spending at recent\nlevels, especially if incomes did not rise at a robust pace in line with\ncurrent forecasts. In the housing sector, activity remained elevated despite\nsome increase in mortgage rates since early summer.\n\nMembers anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which\nhad been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would\nslow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases\nin state and local spending. Although fiscal policy more generally would\nprobably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect\nwas expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were\nlikely to persist. Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern\nabout the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets\nand the economy.\n\nIn their remarks about the external sector of the economy, members noted\nthat an improvement in the economic outlook in many foreign economies,\nas well as the lower dollar, was likely to foster a pickup in exports.\nWhile some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster\ngrowth in the United States, domestic demand in several major trading\npartners appeared to be strengthening. Nonetheless, the value of U.S.\nimports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin,\nand the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction\nadded to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy.\n\nIn their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated\nthat persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods\nmarkets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with\na number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct\npossibility. Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on\nprices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently\nquite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which\nwould reduce labor costs. In addition, some members noted that the current\nunemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since\nthe labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late,\nand changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level\nof unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages.\nHowever, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation\nwere viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and\nthe risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced\nweakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small\n- was now regarded by most as virtually nil. Indeed, the weaker dollar,\nhigher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were\nseen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices\neven though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had\nnot had a large effect on retail prices in the past. Members also expressed\nconcern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations\ngiven highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that\nseemed to be gathering momentum. Some noted that the rise in recent months\nin inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields\non nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in\nthis direction. Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered\nthe upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on\nthe downside for the next few quarters.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead,\nall the members favored an unchanged policy that continued to incorporate\na target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The data and anecdotal\nevidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members\nmore confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.\nNonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance\nremained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation,\nwide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable\nuncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down.\nIn these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain\nsubdued well into the future. To be sure, the Committee needed to remain\nattentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared\nto adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted\nsuch a move. At some point, a move in the direction of a less accommodative\nand more neutral policy posture might well be necessary should the apparently\nvigorous expansion continue and over time promote fuller utilization of\nresources. For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit\nin maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking\npreemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation,\nwith associated costs to economic performance.\n\nIn their discussion of the announcement to be issued shortly after this\nmeeting, the members agreed that in addition to updating to reflect recent\neconomic developments, some rewording was needed to reflect their evolving\nassessment of the risks to the economy. In light of the recent acceleration\nin economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth\nahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed\nassessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had\ndiminished appreciably. While a number of members saw some slight further\ndisinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material\nchange in inflation. All could agree that the risks of further disinflation\nwere substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.\nIn the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no\nlonger necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks\nto growth and inflation taken together.\n\nViews differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining\nan accommodative monetary policy \"for a considerable period.\" A number\nof members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's\nflexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed\nappropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances. A majority,\nhowever, preferred to retain the phrase, at least for now. They noted\nthat the changes in their assessment of risk would convey the evolving\nviews of the Committee and they believed the \"considerable period\" reference\nstill accurately conveyed the Committee's policy intentions. Given the\ndecision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit\nin associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically\nthe persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed\nto having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize\nand direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed\notherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance\nwith the following domestic policy directive.\n\n\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions\nthat will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.\nTo further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future\nseeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the\nfederal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.\"\n\nThe vote encompassed the following statements concerning the risks to\nthe Committee's outlook for economic growth and inflation. These statements\nwould be included in the press release to be made available shortly after\nthe meeting.\n\nThe Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment\nof sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The\nprobability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent\nmonths and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,\nBernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn,\nMoskow, Olson, and Parry.\n\nVote against this action: None.\n\nAt this meeting Mr. Ferguson reported on the progress of the working\ngroup that was charged at the October 28 meeting with developing some\nspecific proposals regarding how best to communicate the Committee's assessment\nof the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The working group\nhad solicited and received comments from the members of the Board of Governors\nand from the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks regarding potential\napproaches for improving communications with the public and enhancing\nthereby the latter's understanding of monetary policy decisions. It was\nagreed that the working group, with the assistance of staff at the Board\nof Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks, would prepare more detailed\nproposals together with supporting staff documentation for consideration\nat a later meeting of the Committee.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nTuesday- Wednesday, January 27-28, 2004.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m."
