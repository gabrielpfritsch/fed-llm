The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's\nforeign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in\nconformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:\n\nA. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through\nspot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with\nthe U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold\nReserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International\nSettlements, and with other international financial institutions:\n\nCanadian dollars Danish kroner Euro Pounds sterling Japanese yen Mexican pesos Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\nB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the\nforeign currencies listed in paragraph A above.\n\nC. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal\ncurrency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any\nsuch arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that\ntime was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically\nauthorizes a delay.\n\nD. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion.\nFor this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum\n(disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign\ncurrency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future\nreceipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these\nelements with due regard to sign.\n\n2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to\nmaintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\" arrangements) for the System Open Market\nAccount for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are\namong those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section\n214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the\nCommittee to renew such arrangements on maturity:\n\nForeign bank\n\nAmount of arrangement (millions of dollars equivalent)\n\nBank of Canada\n\n2,000\n\nBank of Mexico\n\n3,000\n\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new\narrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above shall, unless\notherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of\nproviding an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of\nadjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with\nforeign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.\n\n4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of\nforeign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on\nSystem holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit\nitself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.\nAny agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors\nunder Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to\nmeet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration\nof no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration). When appropriate in connection\nwith arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government\nsecurities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such\nsecurities within 30 calendar days.\n\n6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to\nthe Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee\nconsists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of\nGovernors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence\nof members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the\nChairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).\nMeetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the\nManager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or\ncontemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his\nresponsibilities. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such\nreviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n7. The Chairman is authorized:\n\nA. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding\nwith the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency\noperations between the System and the Treasury;\n\nB. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency\noperations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency\noperations;\n\nC. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory\nCouncil on International Monetary and Financial Policies.\n\n9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System\nAccount in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure\nwith Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in the form shown\nbelow.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (Reaffirmed February 1, 2005)\n\n1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly\nmarket conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and\nbehavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.\n\n2. To achieve this end the System shall:\n\nA. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.\n\nB. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with selected foreign central banks.\n\nC. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with international\nmonetary institutions.\n\n3. Transactions may also be undertaken:\n\nA. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.\n\nB. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies,\nand to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n\nC. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.\n\n4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:\n\nA. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States Treasury;\n\nB. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; and\n\nC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the International\nMonetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under IMF Article IV.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency\nOperations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.\n\nPROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO\nFOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS (Reaffirmed February 1, 2005)\n\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the\nForeign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System\nOpen Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings\nwith respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency\nSubcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to such\nclearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman\nbelieves that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign\ncurrencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular\nmeeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net position in a\nsingle foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is\nassociated with repayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by\nthe System, even though the change in the System's net position in that currency might be\nless than the limits specified in 1.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million\nor (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee\nbelieves that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with\nthe Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible\nin the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign\ncurrencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or\n(ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap\ndrawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was\namended and approved in the form shown below. The amendment involved removing from\nparagraph 1(a) the reference to the limit on the amount by which the System Open Market Account\nholdings of securities can change between FOMC meetings. This limit had become outdated, as it\nhad been superseded by other, more effective mechanisms for the Committee to oversee Desk\noperations.\n\nAUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (Amended February 1, 2005)\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a\nmeeting of the Committee:\n\n(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing\nBank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest\nby, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign\nand international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash,\nregular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for\nsuch Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the\nTreasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;\n\n(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully\nguaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the\naccount of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such\nsecurities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly\nauthorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying\nreasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the\nevent Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased\nby the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or\ntransferred to the System Open Market Account.\n\n(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully\nguaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System\nOpen Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations\nin 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee,\nshall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of\nagreements with individual dealers.\n\n2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S.\nGovernment securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be\ndetermined by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum\nlending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the\ntotal amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each\ndealer may borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate\na dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork.\n\n3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the\nprovision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as\nfiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for\nSystem Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set\nforth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those\nsecurities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in\nthe market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers,\nsubject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase\nagreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and\nrepurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency\naccounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions\nof this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.\n\n4. In the execution of the Committeeï¿½s decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period,\nthe Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction\nof the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of\npressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate. Any such adjustment shall\nbe made in the context of the Committeeï¿½s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and\nthe Committeeï¿½s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall\nbe based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.\nConsistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee\nbefore making any adjustment.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee made several amendments to its rules, statements,\nand resolutions, including to align the starting dates of Committee membership terms of Presidents with those of Committee officers, and to authorize the Secretary of the Committee, with the\nconcurrence of the General Counsel, to make technical changes to the rules in the future.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC\nInformation on February 1, 2005, to reflect an updating and streamlining of the document.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in\nforeign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the\nSystem's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on\ndevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 14, 2004 to\nFebruary 1, 2005. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nAt this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion of the pros and\ncons of formulating a numerical definition of the price-stability objective of monetary policy. A\nstaff presentation on the topic included a review of the potential costs and benefits of introducing\nsuch a definition as well as of other countriesï¿½ experiences. In the subsequent discussion, meeting\nparticipants uniformly agreed that price stability provided the best environment for maximizing\nsustainable economic growth in the long run, but expressed a range of views on whether it would\nbe helpful for the Committee to articulate a specific numerical definition for the Federal Reserve's\nprice-stability objective--either a single figure or a range. Those who believed such a move would\nbe on balance beneficial cited, for example, its usefulness as an anchor for long-term inflation\nexpectations, as a vehicle for enhanced clarity of Committee deliberations, and as an additional tool\nfor communications. Several of those who saw greater potential drawbacks were concerned that\nsuch a shift might appear to be inconsistent with the Committeeï¿½s dual mandate of fostering\nmaximum employment as well as price stability or that it might inappropriately bias or constrain policy at times; in any case, with inflation expectations well-contained over recent years, the\nbenefits of announcing a specific inflation objective were not likely to be large. The Committee\ndecided to defer further discussion.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a\nsolid pace in recent months. Consumer spending and the housing market continued to exhibit\nstrength, and business fixed investment grew robustly in the fourth quarter. The pace of inventory\naccumulation picked up and industrial production accelerated. The labor market showed further\nsigns of improvement. Core consumer prices rose moderately over the past few months, and\nmeasures of inflation expectations remained well-anchored.\n\nModerate increases in payroll employment during November and December pushed the\naverage monthly advance in the quarter well above that of the third quarter. Employment gains\nwere fairly widespread, with hiring in business services, health care, financial activities, and\nwholesale trade more than offsetting continued sluggishness in manufacturing and a seasonally\nadjusted decline in retail services during December. Surveys of employersï¿½ hiring plans and job\nopenings pointed to continued moderate gains in employment early this year. The average\nworkweek during the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter, and as a result aggregate\nhours decelerated despite the pickup in employment growth. The unemployment rate held steady at\n5.4 percent in December.\n\nIndustrial activity accelerated noticeably during the fourth quarter. The pickup of\nindustrial production in December owed largely to increased motor vehicle assemblies and a\nturnaround in the output of utilities associated with cold weather across the northeast. Production\nof high-tech goods slowed slightly in the fourth quarter. Available weekly physical product data\nsuggested that manufacturing production would increase moderately in January. Capacity utilization continued to climb through the end of the year but remained below its longer-run\naverage.\n\nReal consumer spending expanded briskly in December and in the fourth quarter as a\nwhole, with retail sales exhibiting widespread strength across categories. Expenditures on\nconsumer services also continued to post solid increases. A surge in light vehicle sales in\nDecember pulled the average rate of sales during the fourth quarter slightly above the third-quarter\npace. Real disposable personal income increased at a rapid rate at the end of the year--boosted in\npart by the special dividend payment by Microsoft; excluding this payment, real disposable\npersonal income rose at a more moderate rate. Measures of consumer confidence remained\nfavorable and consistent with sustained increases in spending.\n\nResidential housing activity remained buoyant in the fourth quarter. A rebound in\nsingle-family housing starts in December from a disappointing November brought the fourthquarter\npace about in line with that earlier in the year. Sales of new and existing homes slipped\nsome late in the year but remained robust. Mortgage rates had changed little since August and\ncontinued to support demand. Construction activity in the multifamily sector weakened a bit in\nNovember and December, but indicators of underlying demand pointed to a rebound in starts in\nJanuary.\n\nBusiness fixed investment continued to be bolstered by favorable fundamentals,\nincluding sustained expansion of business output, the flush cash position of many firms, readily\navailable credit, and a still-favorable cost of capital. Equipment and software spending grew at a\nsolid rate in the fourth quarter, though not quite as briskly as in the third quarter owing to a\ndeceleration in spending outside the high-tech sector. By contrast, investment in nonresidential\nstructures had edged down in recent months, with expenditures only for drilling and mining operations showing some strength amid flat outlays for manufacturing facilities and a decline in\nspending on office buildings.\n\nNonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the fourth quarter than they had in the third\nquarter. The buildup of inventories was widespread across manufacturers, wholesalers, and\nretailers as well as across stages of production. Motor vehicle inventories were an exception, as\nmotor vehicle manufacturers sought to reduce stocks of unsold light vehicles. The aggregate\ninventory-sales ratio outside of motor vehicles likely edged up in the fourth quarter but remained\nwithin the range that had prevailed since the middle of last year.\n\nThe most recent data suggested that the U.S. international trade deficit widened in the\nfourth quarter as a result of a broad-based decline in exports of goods and increase in imports of oil\nand consumer goods. The expansion in economic activity in the major foreign industrialized\neconomies appeared to remain sluggish in the fourth quarter, but the growth of real GDP in Latin\nAmerica and emerging Asia likely stepped up.\n\nCore consumer prices decelerated over the past few months, while overall consumer\nprices were buffeted by movements in energy prices. The rate of increase in core prices in the\ntwelve months ending in December was somewhat higher than the very low rate that prevailed\nduring the year-earlier period; the overall index also accelerated, with about half of its advance\naccounted for by a sharp rise in energy prices. Measures of inflation expectations were little\nchanged over the intermeeting period. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index\ndecelerated in the fourth quarter; the slowdown was attributable to wages, which gained only\nslightly, while benefit costs rose a bit faster than in the third quarter.\n\nAt its meeting on December 14, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to\nincrease its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both\nsustainable growth and price stability were roughly equal. The Committee also noted that output\nappeared to be growing at a moderate pace and labor market conditions continued to improve\ngradually, while inflation and inflation expectations remained well-contained. As a result, the\nCommittee again judged that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to\nbe measured, although the path of policy would depend importantly on evolving economic\nprospects.\n\nThe Committeeï¿½s decision at its December meeting to increase the federal funds rate had\nbeen fully anticipated in financial markets, and reaction to the attendant statement was muted. The\nrelease of the minutes of the December meeting on January 4, however, triggered a significant\nupward revision in the anticipated path of monetary policy: Investors apparently read them as\nexpressing more widespread concern among Committee members about inflation pressures than\nhad been the case previously. Market participants viewed the generally favorable incoming data on\neconomic activity as consistent with their expectations of firmer policy. Interest rates on\nintermediate-term Treasury securities rose in response to the revision to policy expectations, but\nlonger-term yields were little changed over the intermeeting period. As yields on inflation-indexed\nTreasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation\ncompensation remained about unchanged. Risk spreads on corporate bonds were stable at\nrelatively low levels, consistent with favorable indicators of corporate credit quality. Broad stock\nindexes declined a bit over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar ended\nthe period little changed on a trade-weighted basis, appreciating against the major European\ncurrencies but falling vis-ï¿½-vis other important trading partners.\n\nM2 grew moderately in recent months, its expansion restrained by rising opportunity\ncosts associated with monetary policy tightening. Because changes in interest rates on liquid\ndeposits typically lag those in market interest rates, the growth of that component slowed in the\nsecond half of 2004. By contrast, growth of small time deposits, whose yields closely track market\nrates, picked up. Currency growth was about flat in December.\n\nIn the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand\nat a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over this year and next, while hiring was\nexpected to firm some more, resulting in a further decrease in the unemployment rate. Household\nspending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and\nsomewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth\nand the need for households to rebuild savings. After a temporary dip in the level of business\ninvestment this quarter related to the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision, investment\noutlays were seen as likely to resume vigorous growth in response to steadily rising sales, strong\ncorporate balance sheets, supportive financial conditions, and an ongoing need to replace or\nupgrade aging equipment and software. Real net exports were projected to be roughly stable for\nseveral quarters, held up by the lagged effect of the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar and\nsome strengthening in foreign demand. Measures of total consumer price inflation were expected\nto decline over the forecast horizon as energy prices receded, while core inflation was seen as\nremaining stable in the staff forecast. Tendencies for core inflation to increase because of slightly\nhigher trend unit labor costs and a narrowing margin of resource slack were expected to be offset\nby the waning contribution of elevated prices for energy and imported goods.\n\nIn their discussion of the economic outlook, the meeting participants regarded incoming\ndata since the last meeting as supporting their expectations that, with the further removal of monetary accommodation, GDP would likely grow at a moderate pace consistent with a gradual\nreduction of remaining economic slack, and inflation would probably continue to be low. Domestic\ndemand had stayed strong through the fourth quarter and should continue to be bolstered by\nfavorable financial conditions. Recent data indicated low and stable rates of core consumer\ninflation and apparently well-anchored inflation expectations. Against this backdrop, the risks to\nthe outlook for both output and inflation relative to the Committee's goals appeared to remain well-balanced.\n\nIn preparation for the Federal Reserveï¿½s semi-annual report to the Congress on the\neconomy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the\nFederal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of\nunemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2005 and 2006. As part of its\ncontinuing effort to improve its communications, the Committee had earlier decided to add one\nyear to the forecast period so as to make the projections more useful to the public. The forecasts of\nthe rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for\n2005; for 2006 the forecasts were in a slightly lower range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, with a central\ntendency at 3-1/2 percent. These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate\nin the range of 5 to 5-1/2 percent and a central tendency of 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005\nand 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate of inflation, as measured by the core\nPCE price index, was expected to remain fairly stable, with forecasts concentrated in the lower\nportion of a 1-1/2 to 2 percent range for both this year and next.\n\nIn their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, meeting\nparticipants noted that, relative to several months ago, many firms now seemed somewhat more\nconfident about the economic outlook. The anticipation of increased sales relative to existing production capacity and also desires to upgrade technology and improve competitiveness were\nleading firms to increase spending on equipment and software. Gains in capital spending had been\nquite strong last year, and while some of that spending might have been motivated by the year-end\nexpiration of the partial-expensing provisions of the tax code, participants had seen little evidence\nto date that there would be a significant slowdown in the growth of spending in the early part of\n2005. Low longer-term interest rates on corporate borrowing--reflecting in part narrow credit risk\nspreads--along with strong corporate profitability and improved balance sheets were continuing to\nsupport fairly brisk growth of capital expenditures. Low longer-term nominal interest rates were\npartly attributable to well-contained inflation expectations, but low real interest rates, along with\nslight declines in equity prices so far this year, might reflect lingering caution on the part of\nbusinesses about the outlook. Nevertheless, narrow credit spreads and risk premiums, along with\nabundant liquidity in financing markets, suggested that markets now assigned fairly low odds to\nsignificant downside risks.\n\nSolid income gains, low interest rates, and consumer confidence were seen by\nparticipants as helping to sustain strong growth of household spending. Some firms had reported\nthat holiday sales were higher than a year earlier and better than expected, while auto sales had\nresponded strongly to incentives in December. The current low measured saving rate seemed\nmostly explainable by the strength of expected income gains, low interest rates, and the increase in\nhousehold wealth resulting from the rise in equity and housing prices. Although the saving rate\nmight well drift up over the next couple of years, participants generally thought it likely that\nconsumer spending would continue growing at a strong pace. However, a marked slowing in home\nprice appreciation and possible increases in longer-term interest rates, which would raise financing\ncosts and reduce opportunities to extract equity from homes through refinancings and home equity loans, were seen as downside risks to the prospects for consumption spending and for housing\nconstruction.\n\nSeveral participants mentioned that the low level of measured national saving, which\nimplied a continued need for foreign financing of U.S. investment, and imbalances in the external\nsector imparted additional uncertainty to the longer-term economic outlook. The extent to which\nthe federal budget deficit would decline over coming years was an open question. As regards the\ncurrent account balance, some participants noted that the sharp drop in net exports in November\nprobably reflected transitory factors in large part, as well as reported measurement errors.\nHowever, there has been little hard evidence as yet of a strengthening in the growth of spending in\nour foreign trading partners or of substantial effects on net exports from previous dollar declines.\nAs a result, the external imbalance seemed likely to remain elevated, with a high level of\nuncertainty surrounding the prospects for and path of adjustment.\n\nA number of participants noted continued modest gains in employment, though some\ncommented that, based on anecdotal information, job growth seemed to have picked up of late.\nThe increase in aggregate demand was expected to be sufficient over coming quarters to allow the\nrate of unemployment to continue to edge lower even as more people return to the labor force.\nParticipants noted considerable uncertainty about the sustainable rate of resource utilization and\nabout structural productivity growth. One participant suggested that, given the range of\nuncertainty, output might already be at or close to potential. Others commented that recent studies\ndid not on balance support a conclusion that structural labor market shifts had caused resource\nslack to be lower than commonly estimated and that the flat pattern of growth in wages and\ncompensation suggested an absence of pressures in labor markets. However, unit labor costs had\naccelerated over 2004 owing to a tapering off in productivity growth. If that slowing reflected a moderation in structural productivity growth and if firms believed that the associated increases in\nthe growth rate of labor costs were permanent, these cost pressures might be passed through to\nconsumer prices fairly quickly to preserve profit margins. While participants generally felt that the\npace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to\ndevelopments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.\n\nDespite some pickup in costs, participants thought that the rate of core inflation likely\nwould remain low and stable, assuming further removal of policy accommodation. Elevated price\nmarkups and profits, as well as slack in resource use, had helped absorb cost increases and put\ndownward pressure on inflation and would likely continue to do so. Indeed, core inflation\nmeasures had eased off, both in the latest readings and on balance over the second half of 2004\nrelative to the first half. However, several participants suggested the possibility of an upward skew\nto the distribution of inflation outcomes, especially if there were appreciable further declines in the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar or in structural productivity growth; already some participants\nwere hearing anecdotal reports from firms of an increased ability to pass cost increases through to\nproduct prices, perhaps because of increasing confidence in the outlook for the economic\nexpansion.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members\nfavored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/2 percent at this meeting.\nAll members judged that a further quarter-point firming in the target federal funds rate was\nappropriate in light of current overall accommodative financial conditions and the continuing\noutlook for solid economic growth and diminished slack in resource utilization. A higher nominal\nfederal funds rate was seen as needed to contain risks of increased cost and price pressures, but\neven with this action, the real federal funds rate was generally seen as remaining below levels that might reasonably be associated with maintaining a stable inflation rate over the medium run. The\npace of policy moves at upcoming meetings, however, would depend on incoming data.\n\nWith regard to the Committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, members\nconcurred that overall economic prospects were similar to those prevailing at the time of the\nDecember meeting and that consequently the statement should be altered only to the minor extent\nrequired to reflect recent economic developments. They concurred that the statement should note\nthat output appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, that labor\nmarket conditions continued to improve gradually, and that inflation and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remained well-contained. They also agreed again to characterize the risks to\nsustainable growth and price stability as balanced. All members agreed that the FOMC statement\nfor this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that\nwas likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects\nas needed to maintain price stability.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the\nSystem Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\n\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial\nconditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in\noutput. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate\nfuture seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the\nfederal funds rate at an average of around 2-1/2 percent.\"\n\nThe vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to\nbe released shortly after the meeting:\n\n\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment\nof both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be\nroughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the\nCommittee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is\nlikely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in\neconomic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,\nBernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn,\nKohn, Moskow, Olson, Santomero, and Stern.\n\nVote against this action: None.\n\nMr. Guynn voted as alternate member.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 22, 2005.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m. on February 2, 2005.\n\nNotation Vote By notation vote completed on December 31, 2004, the Committee unanimously\napproved the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 14,\n2004.\n\n1.
