It shall be the normal practice to arrange with\nforeign central banks for the coordination of foreign\ncurrency transactions.

Any agreements or\nunderstandings concerning the administration of the\naccounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork with the foreign banks designated by the Board of\nGovernors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be\nreferred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n5.

The Procedural\nInstructions, as amended, are shown below:\n\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the\nauthorization and direction of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign\nCurrency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the\nManager of the System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"),\nshall be guided by the following procedural\nunderstandings with respect to consultations and\nclearance with the Committee, the Foreign Currency\nSubcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All\noperations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall\nbe reported promptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or\nwith the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that\nconsultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in\nthe time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in\nthe System's overall open position in foreign\ncurrencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600\nmillion since the most recent regular meeting of the\nCommittee.\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on\nany day in the System's net position in a single\nforeign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300\nmillion when the operation is associated with repayment\nof swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a\nsubstantial volume of trading in a particular currency\nby the System, even though the change in the System's\nnet position in that currency might be less than the\nlimits specified in 1B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank\nnot exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15\npercent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or\nwith the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes\nthat consultation with the full Committee is not\nfeasible in the time available, or with the Chairman,\nif the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in\nthe System's overall open position in foreign\ncurrencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent\nregular meeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank\nexceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15\npercent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the\nSubcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap\ndrawings by the System, and about any operations that\nare not of a routine character.\n\nThe Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account,\nconducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and\nPayments Systems as of the close of business on July 31, 1992, was\naccepted.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 22,\n1992, were approved.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets during the period December\n22, 1992, through February 2, 1993. There were no System open market\ntransactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market\ntransactions in government securities and federal agency obligations\nduring the period December 22, 1992, through February 2, 1993. By\nunanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1993, and the\nimplementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.\nA summary of the economic and financial information available at the\ntime of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided\nbelow, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by\nthe Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that\neconomic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter.\nFinal demands were buoyed by strength in consumption, business\nspending for durable equipment, and residential construction.\nManufacturing activity also increased considerably, and employment\nappeared to be on a modest upward trajectory, despite a continuing\nflow of announcements of layoffs by large corporations. Although\nrecent data on wages and prices had been mixed, on balance they\nsuggested that inflation was trending gradually lower.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment registered a small increase\nin December for the fourth consecutive month. Service industries,\nnotably business and health services, and retail trade accounted for\nnearly all of the rise in jobs. Manufacturing and construction\npayrolls changed little, and government employment fell as temporary\nelection workers were dropped from payrolls. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point below\nits mid-year peak but slightly above its level at the beginning of the\nyear.\n\nIndustrial production advanced further in December and was up\nconsiderably over the fourth quarter as a whole. Motor vehicle\nassemblies rose sharply during the quarter; strong gains also were\nregistered in business equipment, partly reflecting a further jump in\noutput of computers, and in nondurable consumer goods. By contrast,\nthe production of durable consumer goods other than motor vehicles was\nlower on balance after changing little over the third quarter, and the\noutput of defense and space equipment remained on a downward trend.\nTotal utilization of industrial capacity increased significantly in\nthe fourth quarter and for the year as a whole.\n\nConsumer spending was up substantially in the fourth quarter.\nRetail sales, after rising sharply in October and changing little in\nNovember, posted a further sizable increase in December. The largest\nsales gains in the fourth quarter were reported at automotive dealers\nand at building material and supply outlets, but most other types of\nretail stores also recorded higher sales. By contrast, consumer\nspending for services, as indicated by data on personal consumption\nexpenditures, rose more slowly. Housing starts surged in December,\nwith single family starts reaching their highest level in nearly three\nyears and multifamily starts picking up slightly from the very low\nlevels of October and November. Sales of new and existing homes\nremained on a strong upward trend in December.\n\nReal outlays for business fixed investment apparently\nregistered a notable gain in the fourth quarter, particularly for\nproducers' durable equipment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods\nrose in November and December after changing little in October; for\nthe quarter as a whole, shipments advanced substantially, with\nincreases widespread by category. Business purchases of cars and\ntrucks were up sharply in the fourth quarter, while nonresidential\nconstruction activity retraced a small part of a third-quarter\ndecline.\n\nBusiness inventories expanded moderately in November as a\nsizable drop in manufacturing inventories was more than offset by\nincreases in wholesale and retail inventories. At the manufacturing\nlevel, the drawdown of stocks was associated with strong shipments of\ndurable goods, and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries\nwere at or near the bottom of their recent ranges. In the wholesale\nsector, sizable inventory increases were reported in November for a\nsecond straight month; most of the buildup was limited to machinery,\nmotor vehicles, and miscellaneous nondurable goods. With stocks\nrising in line with sales since September, the stock-to-sales ratio in\nwholesaling remained at the low end of its range over the past year.\nRetail inventories increased moderately further in November; the\ninventory-to-sales ratio for the sector was slightly below its average\nfor previous months of the year.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly\nin November. For October and November together, however, the deficit\nnarrowed a little from its average rate in the third quarter, as the\nvalue of exports rose more than the value of imports. Most of the\nincrease in exports was in capital goods, both machinery and aircraft,\nand in consumer goods. Passenger cars accounted for a considerable\npart of the rise in imports, while the inflow of consumer goods eased\nfrom the very strong pace of the third quarter. Recent indicators\nsuggested that economic activity had remained weak in the major\nforeign industrial countries and that unemployment rates had increased\nfurther in most of those countries. The recovery in Canada appeared\nto be continuing, but the downturn in western Germany and Japan\nevidently had persisted into the fourth quarter.\n\nA small November decline in producer prices of finished\ngoods was reversed in December, with a rebound in prices of finished\nfoods outweighing a further drop in energy prices. For finished items\nother than food and energy, producer prices rose in December, but the\nadvance followed six months of no change on balance; for 1992 as a\nwhole, this measure of prices increased by a considerably smaller\namount than in 1991. At the consumer level, the index for prices of\nnonfood, non-energy items edged higher in December after somewhat\nlarger increases in the two preceding months. The rise in this index\nin 1992 was the smallest for any year since the early 1970s, when wage\nand price controls were in effect. Hourly compensation of private\nindustry workers advanced a little more rapidly in the fourth quarter\nthan in the two previous quarters, but the rise in total compensation\nover the year as a whole was considerably smaller than in 1991. The\nslowing of labor cost increases last year occurred in both the wages\nand benefits components.\n\nAt its meeting on December 22, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nexpansion of M2 at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent and with M3\nremaining about unchanged on balance over the four-month period from\nNovember through March.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was well above expected\nlevels in the first two full reserve maintenance periods in the\nintermeeting interval; borrowing was sizable over the long New Year's\nweekend and also later when unusually heavy Treasury tax receipts\ndrained reserves from the banking system. The federal funds rate\naveraged close to expected levels over the intermeeting period.\nHowever, the rate was somewhat volatile in late December as a result\nof sizable swings in market factors affecting reserves and of shifting\nmarket anticipations regarding year-end pressures.\n\nMost other short-term interest rates declined somewhat over\nthe intermeeting period, in part reflecting the passing of year-end\npressures. Intermediate- and long-term rates, including those on\nfixed-rate mortgages, also moved somewhat lower; the declines occurred\nin response to growing indications that any proposed near-term fiscal\nstimulus would be quite moderate and that the new Administration\nintended to recommend steps, possibly including new taxes, to lower\nthe trajectory of the fiscal deficit appreciably over time. Broad\nindexes of stock prices exhibited mixed results over the intermeeting\nperiod: Indexes giving heavy weight to large companies changed\nlittle, while those primarily reflecting smaller companies rose\nsignificantly.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over the\nintermeeting period. Through early January, the dollar appreciated\nagainst both the yen and the mark, especially the latter, in response\nto actual and expected further declines in interest rates in Japan and\nGermany. Subsequently, the dollar's gains were partially erased as\nthe prospects for near-term easing in Germany diminished somewhat and\nperceptions grew that fiscal initiatives in the United States would\nlower the deficit and reduce the chances that monetary policy might be\ntightened in the months ahead.\n\nAfter expanding at a moderate pace over the course of earlier\nmonths, M2 contracted in December and January. Some of the weakness\nreflected a slowdown in Ml growth associated with lower mortgage\nrefinancing activity. Within M2's nontransaction component, the\nexpansion of savings and money market deposit accounts slowed\nabruptly, perhaps owing in part to the wider spread that had developed\nduring the fall between market rates and those paid on these accounts,\nas well as to the use of monies in these accounts to fund a step-up in\nconsumer purchases and nonwithheld tax payments. In addition, the\ncontinued attractiveness to investors of bond and stock mutual funds\nmight have contributed to a quickening of the runoff of holdings of\nmoney market mutual funds and to the persisting weakness in other M2\naccounts. Appreciable declines in M3 in December and January\nreflected both the contraction in M2 and reduced needs by banks for\nmanaged liabilities at a time of weak overall credit demand. From the\nfourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3\ngrew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual\nranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded at\nthe lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for 1992.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity would expand over the year ahead at a pace that\nwould be sufficient to reduce gradually margins of unemployed labor\nand capital. Recent declines in long-term interest rates and more\noptimistic attitudes on the part of businesses and households were\nexpected to support further solid gains in business fixed investment\nand in homebuying. Continuing progress in reducing debt service\nburdens and a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security\nwere projected to foster an expansion of consumer spending a shade\nfaster than the growth in incomes. Export demand would be damped for\nsome period of time by the appreciation of the dollar since mid-1992,\nbut an anticipated pickup in growth abroad later this year would begin\nto counteract the effects of the higher dollar. Against the\nbackground of considerable uncertainties associated with still\nunannounced fiscal policy initiatives, the staff retained for this\nforecast the assumption contained in several previous forecasts that\nfiscal policy would remain mildly restrictive, largely because of\ndeclining defense outlays. The persisting slack in resource\nutilization over the forecast horizon was expected to be associated\nwith some additional progress in reducing inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, the members were encouraged by the mounting\nevidence of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion. On the\nwhole, recent developments tended to reinforce their forecasts of\ncontinuing growth at a moderate pace over the year ahead, especially\nin light of the improvement in business and consumer confidence. The\nimpact of some retarding influences on the expansion, notably various\nbalance sheet adjustment activities, appeared to be waning. In\naddition, while some major sectors of the economy such as defense\nspending and commercial construction remained weak, the economy was\nbenefitting from considerable growth in consumer spending, from rising\nbusiness expenditures for producer equipment, and from increasing\noutlays for housing. In one view, the recent behavior of commodity\nprices also tended to indicate some strengthening in the economy's\nexpansion. Despite various indications of a more firmly established\nexpansion, however, the members felt that the outlook remained subject\nto a good deal of uncertainty, and some commented that substantial\ndeviations--in either direction--from their current forecasts could\nnot be ruled out. It was noted in this connection that the specifics\nof the President's fiscal policy proposals were still unknown, and\ntheir reception by the public and the Congress would have a major\ninfluence on confidence, interest rates, and the performance of the\neconomy. Other sources of uncertainty related to the outlook for\nfurther restructuring activities that involved cutbacks in operations\nand employment by many firms, and the prospective lending policies of\nbanking institutions. With regard to the outlook for inflation, most\nof the members believed that some further progress toward stable\nprices was likely over the year ahead, given an economic outcome about\nin line with their forecasts of continued, albeit reduced, margins of\nunutilized or underutilized productive resources. Some members also\nreferred to the extended period of relatively sluggish growth in the\nbroad measures of money as a favorable indicator in the outlook for\ninflation.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nestablishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt\naggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank\npresidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections\nof economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for\n1993. The central tendencies of the forecasts pointed to slightly\nfaster economic growth this year than currently seemed to have\noccurred in 1992. The anticipated rate of economic expansion would be\nat a pace that was rapid enough to reduce the rate of unemployment a\nlittle further. Nonetheless, with some slack in productive resources\npersisting, price and cost pressures would remain subdued and modest\nadditional moderation in inflation was expected by most members.\nMeasured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3\nto 3-1/4 percent within a full range of 2-1/2 to 4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of\n1993 were concentrated in the upper half of a 6-1/2 to 7 percent\nrange. For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the\nperiod from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993\nwas centered on increases in a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, and\nfor nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6\npercent for the year.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion of various\nfactors underlying the outlook for economic activity, the members\nobserved that on the whole the effects of a number of structural\nimpediments to the expansion seemed to be diminishing as the financial\ncondition of households, business firms, and financial institutions\ncontinued to improve. Household and business debt-service burdens had\neased substantially, but it remained difficult to predict to what\nextent and for how long the ongoing balance sheet adjustments would\ncontinue to divert an unusual proportion of cash flows from spending\nto balance sheet repair. Improved profitability and new capital-market issuance had strengthened the capital positions of banking\ninstitutions, and in general they were now in a much better position\nto augment their lending activities. However, there were few\nindications thus far of any easing in terms or standards on business\nloans, and the depressed and uncertain values of commercial mortgages\nand real estate held in bank portfolios might continue to exert an\ninhibiting effect on the willingness of banks to lend. Another\nnegative factor was the persistence of downsizing and other\nrestructuring activities by numerous firms, notably large businesses.\nSuch restructuring activities had not fully run their course as many\nfirms continued to pare excess production capacity and to modernize\nproduction facilities to meet strong competition in domestic and\nforeign markets. The resulting layoffs had damped overall job growth.\n\nDespite tepid job growth, retail sales had strengthened\nmarkedly during the closing months of 1992, and several members\ncommented that such sales had continued to display surprising vigor in\nsome parts of the country during the early weeks of 1993. Apart from\nthe improvement in consumer sentiment, other favorable factors cited\nwith regard to the outlook for consumer spending included lower debt-service burdens and the capital gains or enhanced cash flows now being\nrealized as sales of homes picked up and mortgage refinancings again\nstrengthened. Some members nonetheless expressed a degree of concern\nabout the sustainability of the gains in consumer spending unless\nthere were faster growth in employment and income to support such\nspending. Announcements by prominent firms of cutbacks in their\nworkforces had continued into the new year, and while job gains at\nother firms, especially smaller ones, were contributing to modest net\ngrowth in overall employment, the publicity surrounding the persisting\njob cutbacks and a tendency for many new jobs to be lower-paying added\nan element of caution to the outlook for consumer expenditures. On\nbalance, with the measured saving rate already at a low level, though\nan argument could be made that the actual rate was somewhat higher\nthan indicated by the currently published data, consumer spending\nseemed likely to expand about in line with the growth in consumer\nincomes over the coming year.\n\nThe growth in consumer incomes in turn was likely to depend\nimportantly on the expansion in business investment spending, and\nmembers cited a number of factors that were expected to provide a\nfavorable setting for sustained momentum in such spending over the\nyear ahead. These included the strengthening of final demands, the\nrecent declines in intermediate -and long-term interest rates, the\ngreater leeway for financial intermediaries to increase their lending\nto businesses, and a continuing desire by business firms to improve\ntheir operating efficiencies. Commercial construction activity,\nhowever, was likely to remain quite sluggish. There were indications\nthat commercial real estate values had stabilized in a number of\nareas, but at low levels, and given the persistence of marked\nimbalances in numerous real estate markets that were the result of\nseveral years of overbuilding, a significant rebound in commercial\nbuilding activity for the nation as a whole might well be several\nyears away. The outlook for housing construction was much more\npromising. Against the background of a general upswing in consumer\nconfidence and the improved balance sheets of many households, the\ndeclines that had occurred in mortgage interest rates had fostered a\nmarked strengthening in the demand for single-family housing as\nevidenced by reports from many parts of the country as well as the\noverall statistics on housing. On the basis of these developments,\nthe members anticipated a continuing impetus to the economic expansion\nfrom housing construction and from related industries over the year\nahead. In addition, the current indications of generally lean\nbusiness inventories, associated in part with strong final demands\nover the past several months, suggested that the prospects for further\ngains in overall spending were likely to stimulate efforts by business\nfirms to build up inventories over the quarters ahead.\n\nThe increasing signs of slow growth or recession in a number\nof foreign nations represented a greater downside risk to the demand\nfor U.S. exports than had been apparent earlier. It was noted, for\nexample, that firms engaged in business activities abroad were\nreporting substantial deterioration in markets for U.S. goods in many\nforeign countries. Growth in U.S. exports might remain positive over\nthe year ahead, but against the background of a relatively expansive\nU.S. economy and the dollar's recent appreciation, the value of\nexports might well fall increasingly short of that of imports with\nadverse effects on the growth of U.S. economic activity.\n\nTurning to the outlook for fiscal policy, members were\nencouraged by the prospect that the President would soon propose a\nprogram that would produce substantial reductions in the federal\ndeficit over the years ahead. Such a deficit-reduction program, if\ndeemed credible, could result in lower intermediate- and long-term\ninterest rates than would otherwise prevail--even before the program\nwas enacted--with very positive implications for interest-sensitive\nexpenditures. For the nearer term, the President was expected to\nannounce some modest fiscal stimulus relative to what was currently in\ntrain. However, the specifics of the President's proposals were not\nyet known and there was little current basis on which to judge\nprospective public and Congressional reactions. Members emphasized\nthe critical need for long-term deficit reduction, and some expressed\nconcern about the adverse effects on financial markets if fiscal\nstimulus measures were to be enacted for the short run without the\nassurance of further legislation to cut federal deficits over time.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, most of the members\nanticipated that the trend toward lower price and wage inflation would\nbe sustained over the year ahead, and one member observed that the\ndisinflationary momentum in the economy might well be underestimated.\nFavorable developments relating to the outlook for inflation included\nevidence of slowing increases in labor costs and continued aggressive\nefforts by many business firms to improve productivity and reduce\ncosts in the face of intense competition from domestic and foreign\nproducers. Indeed, anecdotal reports from around the country\ncontinued to suggest little or no upward pressure on prices in many\nregions. In addition, the behavior of interest rates in longer-term\ndebt markets was consistent with spreading expectations of gradually\ndiminishing inflation. Some members believed, however, that little or\nno further progress in reducing inflation was a more likely outcome in\nthe year ahead, though none anticipated higher inflation. Some\ncommodity price indexes had edged higher recently, apparently in\nresponse to growing demands related to strengthening activity in\nseveral sectors of the economy. Lumber prices in particular had risen\nconsiderably in conjunction with the uptrend in single-family housing\nconstruction and various constraints on lumber supplies. Some\nbusiness contacts reported for the first time in a long while that\nthey were experiencing or anticipated some upward pressure on their\nraw materials prices. Further, while most business contacts saw or\nanticipated little or no upward pressure on prices in their own\nindustries, many continued to expect rising inflation more generally.\nThe still relatively steep slope of the yield curve and its\nimplications with regard to expectations of future increases in\ninterest rates also suggested that investors remained concerned about\nthe possibility of higher inflation over the longer run, even though\nsuch concerns might have abated somewhat recently and did not appear\nto extend to the next year or two. In general, however, the members\nviewed the inflation outlook with considerable optimism on the\npresumption of favorable fiscal and monetary policy developments.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates in 1993 that it had established on a tentative basis\nat its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1992. The tentative ranges included\nexpansion of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt had been set provisionally at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1993.\nAll of these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had\nset for 1992 at its meeting in February of last year and had reaffirmed at mid-year. When the provisional ranges for money growth were\nestablished, the Committee had noted that they were especially\ntentative and subject to revision in the latter part of 1992 or early\n1993 owing to the considerable uncertainty about the evolving\nrelationship of money to income.\n\nIn the event, the velocities of M2 and M3 had increased\nappreciably in the second half of 1992 and analysis of the factors\nbehind this development suggested further increases in the year ahead.\nConsequently, in the Committee's discussion, which tended to focus on\nM2, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to\nlower the tentative ranges for growth of the broad monetary aggregates\nby one-half percentage point for 1993. At the same time, a number of\nmembers indicated that they preferred somewhat different ranges\nincluding the retention of the tentative ranges, lowering the ranges\nby more than the proposal, and widening or narrowing them. All the\nmembers were in firm agreement that the purpose of the proposed\nreductions was not to signal or implement any change in monetary\npolicy or to convey any intention to move away from the Committee's\ncommitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion. Rather, the\nreductions were motivated by the persistence of marked shortfalls in\nthe growth of M2 and M3 from their historical relationships with\nvarious measures of aggregate economic performance; those shortfalls\nappeared to be the technical result of forces that are altering the\nrelationship between money and income. Members of the Committee urged\nthat the Board's report to Congress and the Chairman's accompanying\ntestimony make clear the reasons for the unusual behavior of money and\nits consequences for the Committee's choice of ranges.\n\nThe deviations in monetary growth from historical norms\nreflected a number of developments whose relative importance and\nintensity had shifted to some extent over the course of recent years,\nbut in general they had served to rechannel funds away from depository\ninstitutions, and the associated weakness in deposit growth had raised\nvelocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to money. The result was the need\nfor lower money growth than in the past to support a given rate of\nincome growth. Among the developments that had tended to retard the\nrelative growth of M2 and M3 was the unprecedented steepness of the\nyield curve that had prompted large shifts of funds by savers from M2\naccounts to higher-yielding intermediate- and long-term assets. At\nthe same time, credit growth at bank and thrift depository\ninstitutions had been weak, partly as a result of efforts by these\ninstitutions to improve capital and liquidity positions, and partly\nowing to weak demand. As a consequence, they also had maintained\nrelatively low offering rates on deposits that had provided consumers\nwith an incentive to reduce or hold down their deposit holdings in\norder to pay down relatively high cost mortgages and other debts. In\n1992, sluggish growth of M2 and M3 had been associated with a\nconsiderable acceleration in nominal spending. Indeed, despite growth\nof both M2 and M3 at rates below the Committee's ranges, the expansion\nof the economy had exceeded most forecasts.\n\nThe members generally anticipated that the intensity of these\nforces might diminish in 1993 as borrowers and lending institutions\nachieved more comfortable balance sheet positions. Nonetheless, the\nrelative weakness in money growth was seen as likely to persist to a\nmarked extent. The yield curve, while it had flattened a bit\nrecently, was still expected to provide a considerable incentive for\nmany savers to shift funds out of M2 assets, especially as relatively\nhigh-yielding time deposits continued to mature. In addition, banks\nwere likely to remain generally unaggressive in bidding for deposits,\nin part because their substantial earlier acquisitions of securities\nwould permit them to accommodate some of the anticipated growth in\nloan demand by selling securities or limiting purchases. In these\ncircumstances, restrained money growth seemed likely to remain\nconsistent with relative strength in the economic expansion.\n\nThe members recognized that the strength of the factors that\nwere expected to continue to depress broad money growth in relation to\nincome in 1993 was still subject to considerable uncertainty, and this\nimplied the need for flexibility in assessing the implications of\nmoney growth relative to the Committee's ranges. Should the factors\ninfluencing the behavior of the broad aggregates persist in holding\ndown money growth to the extent seen in 1992, expansion of M2 and M3\nin the lower portion of their reduced ranges would be consistent with\nconsiderable further growth in nominal spending. Indeed, a shortfall\nfrom the reduced ranges could not be ruled out, and one member felt\nthat the potential for such a development warranted consideration of a\nsomewhat larger reduction in the M2 range; such a reduction also would\nsignal more clearly the Committee's commitment to price stability. On\nthe other hand, the upper portions of the reduced ranges would still\naccommodate an ample provision of liquidity to support further\neconomic expansion even if the growth of money and of income were to\nmove toward an historically more normal alignment and velocity were to\nslow from its high rate of increase. In one view, widening the\ntentative M2 range by reducing its lower limit while retaining its\nupper limit would help the Committee to convey its views regarding the\npotential for a continuing but acceptable sluggishness in M2 growth\nwhile leaving room for the possibility of faster M2 expansion should\nchanging circumstances foster diminishing strength in velocity.\nAnother member expressed a preference for narrowing the tentative\nrange by lowering only its upper limit as a means of signaling the\nCommittee's intent to resist both inflationary and recessionary\ndevelopments. In light of the uncertainties that were involved, the\ninformational content of the aggregates probably had diminished and in\nany event the Committee would need to continue to evaluate monetary\ngrowth developments in the context of a careful assessment of a wide\nvariety of other financial, economic, and price developments. In this\nconnection, one member observed that the uncertainties were of such a\nmagnitude that, while plausible arguments could be made for a number\nof different ranges, retention of the tentative ranges would be\nappropriate in light of the Committee's willingness to review the\nranges in the event that unanticipated developments were to unfold.\n\nAll of the members agreed that it would be desirable to\nretain the monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent that the\nCommittee had established on a provisional basis for the growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt in 1993. The expansion in such debt\nhad not been damped by special forces to the same extent as the broad\nmonetary aggregates in 1992. Over the year ahead, growth in the\nfederal debt was likely to remain substantial, and the expansion of\ndebt in the nonfederal sectors was projected to accelerate somewhat\ngiven the continued improvement in borrower balance sheets and an\nanticipated increase in the willingness of financial institutions to\nlend as the economy continued to expand. Nonetheless, in the context\nof still cautious attitudes on the part of both borrowers and lenders,\nthe growth of nonfederal debt probably would remain below that of\nnominal GDP in the year ahead.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all of the\nmembers indicated that they favored or could accept a technical\ndownward adjustment of one-half percentage point in the tentative\nranges for the broader monetary aggregates for 1993 to rates of 2 to 6\npercent for M2 and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3. It was agreed that\nthere should be no change from the tentative range for total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. In keeping with the Committee's usual procedures\nunder the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be reviewed at\nmidyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the growth and\nvelocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial\ndevelopments. Accordingly, by unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1993 was approved by the Committee for inclusion in the\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\nmeeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth\nquarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are\nlikely to persist during the year. The monitoring\nrange for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt\nwas set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nTurning to policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the\nmembers endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in\nreserve markets, and all indicated that they could accept a directive\nthat did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the likely\ndirection of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. While there\nwas concern about the weakness in the monetary aggregates, the members\ngenerally agreed that recent economic developments tended to reinforce\nthe view that monetary policy was on an appropriate course. The\neconomy seemed to be on a stronger growth track than earlier in the\nexpansion, and inflation remained quite subdued--only a bit above some\nestimates of price stability--and likely to moderate further in coming\nquarters in the view of most members. Some commented that a further\neasing move at this juncture might well have adverse effects on\ninflation sentiment and on interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets. A few referred to the recent firming in some\ncommodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that\ninflation could drift higher over the next few years. In the view of\none member, these developments might argue for a tilt in the directive\ntoward possible restraint, but they did not call for an immediate\ntightening in reserve conditions.\n\nA staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested a resumption\nof some growth in the broad measures of money later in the first\nquarter but a decline in both M2 and M3 for the quarter as a whole.\nWhile part of the declines appeared to reflect difficulties\nwith seasonal adjustments and the ebbing of special factors that\npreviously had boosted growth, the uncertainties surrounding the\nbehavior of these aggregates tended to reduce their role in current\nmonetary policy. Nevertheless, there was concern about the\npersisting weakness in the broad aggregates, including the likelihood\nthat they would fall well short of the Committee's new ranges over the\nfirst part of the year. Some members also noted that the growth of\nMl, while still fairly robust in December and January, was markedly\nbelow its pace over most of 1992. On the other hand, bank loans had\nincreased in recent months, and the weakness in the monetary\naggregates did not appear to reflect underlying softness in the\neconomy. In these circumstances, a number of members believed that\nany effort to stimulate monetary growth under immediately prevailing\neconomic conditions and market expectations might well prove to be\ncounterproductive. An easing at this time could accelerate outflows\nfrom interest-sensitive M2 assets if the easing were seen as signaling\na weakening of the System's anti-inflationary resolve and were to\nresult in higher rates on intermediate- and long-term debt securities.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all of the\nmembers indicated that they favored a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.\nThey also noted their preference for, or acceptance of, a directive\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustment to policy over the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nlittle change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period\nfrom January through March.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was\nauthorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to\nexecute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the\nfollowing domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicates\nthat economic activity rose appreciably further in the\nfourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment\nregistered another small increase in December, and the\ncivilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent.\nIndustrial production posted solid gains over the\nclosing months of the year. Retail sales were up\nsubstantially in the fourth quarter, and residential\nconstruction activity increased sharply. Indicators of\nbusiness fixed investment suggest a notable gain in\nrecent months, particularly for producers' durable\nequipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit\nnarrowed slightly in October-November from its average\nrate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and\nprices have been mixed but they continue to suggest on\nbalance a trend toward lower inflation.\n\nInterest rates have declined somewhat since the\nCommittee meeting on December 22. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in\nterms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over\nthe intermeeting period.\n\nM2 appears to have contracted in December and\nJanuary, after expanding at a moderate pace over the\ncourse of previous months; M3 is estimated to have\ndeclined appreciably in both months. From the fourth\nquarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2\nand M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of\nthe Committee's annual ranges for 1992. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt appears to have expanded at the lower\nend of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith little change in M2 and M3 over the period from\nJanuary to March.\n\nAt this meeting the Committee discussed a preliminary report of a\nsubcommittee that had been established to examine various issues\nrelating to the release of information about Committee meetings and\ndecisions. All of the members agreed that the Committee should keep\nthe public as fully informed as possible about its monetary policy\ndecisions and their rationale. Such information could reduce\nuncertainty about the stance of policy and about the factors the\nCommittee takes into account in reaching its decisions. However,\nrelease of information should not be allowed to compromise the\noverriding objective of making and implementing the best possible\ndecisions. In that regard, the Committee noted that its deliberative\nprocess requires a free flow of ideas, including the ability to\nadvance or question hypotheses, to speculate on alternative outcomes,\nand to change opinions in response to the views expressed by other\nmembers. The members also needed to feel at liberty during meetings\nto use a wide array of information that is obtained on a confidential\nbasis; at least some of that information would no longer be provided\nto the Committee if there were a risk of public disclosure. Moreover,\nthe Committee wanted to give further consideration to the risk that\nthe adoption of a different schedule for releasing information about\npolicy decisions might have the effect, in difficult circumstances, of\nreducing its willingness to make needed policy adjustments promptly.\nNo decisions were made at this meeting concerning various options for\napprising the public more fully or promptly of the Committee's\nactions, and it was understood that the subcommittee would continue to\nstudy the matter.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, March 23, 1993.\n\nThe meeting adjourned.\n\nSecretary\n\nFOMC"
