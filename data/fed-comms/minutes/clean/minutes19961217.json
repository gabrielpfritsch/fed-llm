Gavin, Kos, and Rosengren, Vice Presidents,\nFederal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, New York,\nand Boston respectively\n\nMr. Evans, Assistant Vice President, Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on November 13, 1996, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in foreign exchange markets since the meeting on November 13, 1996. There were no transactions in foreign currencies for System account during this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period from\nNovember 13, 1996, through December 16, 1996. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee members discussed certain changes in the\nprocedures for conducting domestic open market operations that the\nManager of the System Open Market Account had proposed for\nimplementation at the beginning of 1997. The changes included\nadvancing the normal time for initiating daily operations by one hour\nto between 10:30 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. Moving to the earlier time would\nplace Desk operations closer to the period during the day when the\nfinancing market was most active and thus in a position to accommodate\na larger volume of System transactions when necessary. As at present,\nthe Manager might choose to undertake Desk operations at other times\nduring the day when special circumstances dictate. The Manager also\nindicated that the normal time for domestic operations might be moved\nto an even earlier hour after expedited procedures were developed for\nassembling the necessary statistical information on a timely basis for\nsuch operations. In the interest of making information about System\noperations available more promptly to market participants and the\nbroader public, the Desk also would begin at the start of 1997 to\nannounce the par amount of its market transactions shortly after the\ncompletion of the operations. With respect to purchases of Treasury\ncoupon securities for System account, the Desk had adopted about one\nyear ago the practice of making such purchases in separate maturity\ntranches but might at its option in the future spread such purchases\nover a number of weeks rather than over the course of several days.\nThis more flexible timing would allow the Desk to inject reserves into\nthe banking system through outright operations as the need arose\nwithout waiting for that need to accumulate to particularly high\nlevels.\n\nAll the members who commented endorsed the changes, with\nseveral noting that they were appropriate responses to evolving market\ncircumstances. Because the new procedures did not involve any\nalterations in the Committee's current directives, authorizations, or\nrules, a formal vote was not required.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent\nmonths. Consumer spending had rebounded from its summer lull, but\nhousing demand was somewhat weaker on balance and the growth of\nbusiness spending on durable equipment had slowed from a very rapid\npace. Although inventory investment had picked up, stocks in most\nsectors had remained well aligned with sales. Both industrial\nproduction and employment had recorded sizable advances. Increases in\nlabor compensation had trended up this year, and consumer price\ninflation also had picked up, but the faster rise in overall consumer\nprices owed entirely to larger increases in food and energy prices.\n\nPrivate-sector demand for labor remained solid in November.\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in\nNovember after an October surge, and the average workweek of private\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers retraced more than half of its\nOctober decline. Service industries recorded another large gain in\nemployment despite a sharp drop in payrolls at help-supply firms, and\nthe number of jobs in retail trade expanded further in November after\na steep rise in October. In the goods-producing sector, employment in\nconstruction and manufacturing rose moderately. The civilian\nunemployment rate increased slightly, to 5.4 percent, in November.\n\nIndustrial production rose sharply in November after a small\nOctober decline. A rebound in motor vehicle assemblies from the\ndisruptive effects of work stoppages accounted for much of the\nincrease in production in November, but output from utilities also\nsurged in response to unusually cool weather. The production of\nnondurable consumer goods and business equipment other than motor\nvehicles also was up significantly in November while the manufacture\nof consumer durables and defense and space equipment decreased\nfurther. Reflecting the strong advance in production, the utilization\nof total industrial capacity picked up considerably in November.\n\nConsumer spending increased appreciably on balance in recent\nmonths after a lackluster performance in the summer. Total retail\nsales fell in November but nonetheless were considerably above their\naverage in the third quarter. The November decline reflected weakness\nin auto sales; retail spending on other items, notably durable goods,\nrose significantly further. Spending on services picked up in October\n(latest data) following a relatively weak third quarter. Housing\nstarts rebounded in November after declining in September and October.\nSingle-family starts in November were a little below the average pace\nof previous months in the year while multifamily starts surged to a\nlevel not seen since late 1990. By contrast, sales of both new and\nexisting homes dropped again in October (latest data).\n\nGrowth of business fixed investment appeared to have slowed\nto a moderate pace in the fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the\nprevious quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell in\nOctober, reversing a sizable September gain; however, recent data on\norders pointed to further increases in business spending for\nequipment, especially for communications equipment where shipments\nalready were at a high level. Business investment in transportation\nequipment evidently weakened, as sales of heavy trucks remained\nsluggish and production shortfalls held back fleet sales of light\nvehicles. By contrast, nonresidential construction continued to\nexpand at a solid rate in October, with building activity particularly\nstrong in the office, other commercial, institutional, and industrial\ncategories.\n\nBusiness inventory investment picked up sharply in October\nfrom the slow September pace, but total stocks remained at a low level\nin relation to sales. Most of the October increase occurred at the\nwholesale level; inventories of farm products turned up sharply after\nmonths of sizable drawdowns, and petroleum stocks were built up from\nunseasonably low levels. Despite the October rise, the ratio of\nwholesale inventories to shipments remained at the lower end of its\nrange over recent years. In manufacturing, stocks increased at a pace\nin line with shipments, and the aggregate inventory-shipments ratio\nstayed at a very low level. Retail inventories were up moderately in\nOctober. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector was unchanged and\nremained in the middle of its range over recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was\nsomewhat larger in September than in August; exports decreased\nslightly in September while imports were little changed. For the\nthird quarter, the deficit widened substantially from its rate in the\nsecond quarter as exports fell and imports rose moderately. Nearly\nall of the decline in exports reflected lower sales of aircraft and\ngold. Increases in imports were widespread but they were largely\noffset by declines in imports of gold and semiconductors. Economic\ngrowth picked up in most of the major foreign industrial countries in\nthe third quarter, but available indicators generally suggested some\nslowing of growth in the fourth quarter. In Japan, by contrast,\neconomic activity had been sluggish in the third quarter but appeared\nto have picked up more recently.\n\nConsumer price inflation in October and November was lifted\nslightly by sizable advances in energy prices and, to a lesser degree,\nincreases in food prices; however, consumer prices for items other\nthan food and energy rose modestly during the two months. The\nrise in core consumer prices over the twelve months ended in November\nwas somewhat smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months,\nalthough the total index registered a bigger advance as a result of\nlarger increases in food and energy prices. At the producer level,\nprices of finished energy goods rose sharply in October and November\nwhile prices of finished foods advanced less rapidly. Excluding food\nand energy, prices of finished goods edged lower on balance over\nOctober and November, and in the twelve months ended in November,\nthese prices rose substantially less than in the previous twelve\nmonths. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers were up considerably in November after edging down in October.\nThe twelve-month rise in this index was somewhat larger than the\nadvance over the previous twelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on November 13, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nand slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand relatively strong expansion of M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. However, the federal funds rate tended to average a little\nabove the level expected with an unchanged policy stance in apparent\nresponse to scattered operating problems and occasional unexpectedly\nlarge clearing needs at banks. Other short-term interest rates\nregistered small mixed changes since the November 13 meeting; Treasury\nbill rates drifted lower, partly because of heightened demands for\nsafety and liquidity as asset markets became more volatile during the\nperiod, while year-end pressures boosted rates on private instruments\nwith maturities in early 1997. At longer maturities, yields drifted\nlower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming\ndata that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and\ninflation subdued, but they rebounded late in the period in response\nto the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding\nthe sustainability of current domestic asset prices. Despite these\nconcerns, most major indexes of equity prices advanced further on\nbalance.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly over the\nintermeeting period. The dollar rose even more against the German\nmark and the French franc amid increased market apprehension that the\nEuropean Monetary Union's common currency, the euro, will not be as\nstrong a currency as the mark. The dollar also might have been\nboosted by statements by French and German officials that suggested\nthe dollar was undervalued against their currencies.\n\nExpansion of the broad monetary aggregates was relatively\nstrong in November. Growth of M2 picked up, reflecting a sharp\nincrease in demand deposits and smaller runoffs in other checkable\ndeposits. Inflows to retail money market funds remained substantial.\nExpansion of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October as\ngrowth in business demands for credit slowed and banks reduced their\nreliance on large time deposits and other managed liability\ncomponents. For the year through November, M2 was estimated to have\ngrown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and\nM3 at a rate a little above the top of its range. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt expanded moderately on balance over recent months\nand remained in the middle portion of its range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's\nestimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to\nincrease at a rate generally in line with the anticipated rise in\ndisposable income; the favorable effects on household wealth of the\nadvance that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability\nof credit for most borrowers were expected to balance the damping\neffects of continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their\nsavings, the security of their jobs, and the extent of their debt\nburdens. Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to\nstabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued\nincome growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of\nhome ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was\nprojected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing\nin the growth of sales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external\nsector were expected to continue to exert small restraining influences\non economic activity over the projection period. Consumer price\ninflation, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy\ncomponents of the price index, was forecast to rise slightly over 1997\nand 1998 in the context of anticipated high resource use and an\naccompanying appreciable pickup in the growth of labor compensation\nthat would be augmented by the legislated rise in the federal minimum\nwage. Somewhat larger increases would have been projected in consumer\nprice inflation in the absence of anticipated technical measurement\nchanges to the index.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\ndevelopments, members commented that the information received during\nthe relatively short interval since the previous meeting had not\nmaterially altered either their assessment that the economy was\nperforming quite favorably or their forecasts of further growth at a\npace averaging near the economy's potential. The economy currently\ndisplayed fairly solid underpinnings, with few imbalances of the kind\nthat historically had tended to create problems. Against the\nbackground of generally supportive financial conditions and a high\ndegree of consumer and business confidence, further economic growth\nwas thought likely to be sustained by appreciable increases in\nconsumer spending and business investment. The overall pace of the\nexpansion was expected to be restrained to an extent, however, by\ndeclining federal government outlays for goods and services and\nongoing weakness in net exports.\n\nDespite the prospects for moderate economic growth, members\nobserved that the risks on inflation still seemed to be tilted toward\nsome rise over time. Measures of core inflation had displayed little\ntrend and even some decline over the past year. However, wage\nincreases had moved higher over that period, a development suggesting\nthe possibility that labor markets might be tighter than could be\nsustained over the long term. At some point accelerating labor\ncompensation costs, were they to continue, likely would spill over\ninto higher inflation. Such an outcome remained subject to a great\ndeal of uncertainty, however, in light of the relatively benign\nbehavior in recent years of both wages and prices in comparison with\nhistorical experience at prevailing levels of resource utilization.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of developments in major\nsectors of the economy bearing on the outlook for business activity,\nmembers noted that consumer spending had picked up as expected after a\nlull during the summer months. Survey data and anecdotal reports\nsuggested that consumer confidence was currently high, and there were\nwidespread indications of robust retail sales during the early weeks\nof the holiday season, though holiday sales were always difficult to\nread at this stage. Thus far, however, sales of motor vehicles had\nnot strengthened to the extent that was anticipated after full\nproduction was restored following a work stoppage at a major\nmanufacturer. Members cited a number of factors--the rise in consumer\ndebt burdens, tightening consumer credit standards, continued worker\nconcerns about job security, and the satisfaction of earlier pent-up\ndemands--that were tending to inhibit the growth in consumer spending\nand perhaps helped to explain why the sharp increases in stock market\nwealth had not been accompanied by stronger growth in such spending.\nThe behavior of the stock market injected an additional note of\nuncertainty into the forecast for consumer spending and the economy\nmore generally. The rise over recent years had been extraordinary\nand had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to\nearnings and dividends. In these circumstances, the members\nrecognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in\nthe stock market and asset markets more generally for their\nimplications for consumer and other spending. On balance, favorable\nemployment and income conditions seemed likely to foster a level of\nconsumer spending that would provide key support for sustained\neconomic expansion.\n\nThe members anticipated smaller though still sizable gains in\nbusiness fixed investment over the year ahead. Slowing growth in\nprofit levels and cash flows was likely to retard spending for many\ntypes of business equipment, but favorable prices, advancing\ntechnology, and readily available financing probably would continue to\nfoster rapid expansion in office, computing, and communications\nequipment. The outlook for nonresidential construction remained\nuneven across the country, but such construction seemed likely to edge\nhigher on balance over the next several quarters. Members noted in\nthis regard that the construction of office buildings had strengthened\nin a number of urban areas. Business inventories currently seemed on\nthe whole to be at desired and sustainable levels in relation to\nsales. In the circumstances, inventory accumulation was projected to\nremain moderate and, barring unexpected surges or declines in final\nsales, was not likely to be a significant factor affecting the course\nof the economy.\n\nThe recent information on residential construction was mixed.\nWeakness in late summer and early fall evidently reflected the effects\nof earlier increases in mortgage interest rates, but some measures of\nhousing activity in November indicated unexpected strength. In\naddition, reports from around the country pointed to uneven conditions\nranging from further strength to some emerging weakness in regional\nhousing markets. On balance, the statistical and anecdotal\ninformation was interpreted, by some members at least, as consistent\nwith a tendency for housing activity to stabilize. In this view, a\nlevel of housing construction somewhat below the peak reached earlier\nin 1996 was likely to be sustained, buoyed in part by the recent\ndecline in mortgage interest rates and the continuing rise in consumer\nincomes and favorable consumer sentiment.\n\nA modest degree of fiscal restraint seemed likely over the\nnext two fiscal years. Some members expressed optimism with regard to\nthe prospects for an agreement between the President and the Congress\nthat would provide a basis for reaching a balanced budget by the year\n2002. Such an agreement would need to include controversial\nconstraints on the growth of entitlements, but its achievement would\nhave favorable effects on financial markets and on business and\nconsumer sentiment more generally, thereby tending to offset at least\nin part any direct effects of reduced federal spending on aggregate\ndemand.\n\nMembers anticipated that the external sector of the economy\nwould continue to exert some restraint on domestic economic activity,\nthough perhaps to a lesser extent than over the past year. In\nparticular, the growth of U.S. exports was expected to accelerate\nsomewhat in association with some strengthening on average in the\neconomies of the nation's key trading partners. The economic recovery\nin Mexico from its earlier financial crisis was already providing a\nconsiderable boost to exports from some parts of the United States.\n\nInflation had remained subdued, but the members continued to\nview the risks as tilted toward increases in the future. Labor\ncompensation costs clearly were rising at a faster pace in the context\nof persistently tight labor markets, and an upturn in core price\ninflation seemed quite possible at some point in the absence of some\neasing of pressures in labor markets. However, the members recognized\nthat the increase in wage inflation had been significantly less than\nwould have been anticipated on the basis of historical relationships\nwith labor market conditions, and price performance also had been more\nfavorable than those relationships would have suggested. In the\ncircumstances, there was a good deal of uncertainty regarding the\noutlook for inflation, including the potential degree of utilization\nin labor markets, the associated pressures on labor costs, and the\nability of firms to pass higher labor costs into prices in markets\nthat generally continued to be described as highly competitive. With\nthe economy operating in the neighborhood of its sustainable\npotential, relatively minor differences in overall economic growth\ncould have a significant effect over time on whether inflation would\ntend to trend up or down.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged policy stance while also retaining a bias toward restraint\nin the directive. An unchanged policy was warranted by the quite\nsatisfactory performance of the economy and inflation and the\nuncertainties surrounding the outlook. Thus, while the longer-term\nrisks might point toward rising inflation, there were reasonable\nprospects that inflation would remain contained, and any pickup in\ninflation, should it occur, was likely to be limited at least for a\ntime. In the circumstances, the members concluded that watchful\nwaiting remained the prudent course for policy as they continued to\nassess ongoing developments. Because the risks of waiting did not\nappear to be substantial at this juncture, anticipatory tightening was\nnot yet called for.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to\npolicy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the\nretention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent\nwith their view that the risks remained biased toward higher\ninflation. Accordingly, while they were not suggesting that policy\nshould be especially quick to react to incoming information over the\nintermeeting period, they did view the next policy move as more likely\nto be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. In this\nconnection, some members emphasized that it would be especially\nimportant for the Committee to act promptly to counter any tendency\nfor price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to\nbecome embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more\ngenerally.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with relatively strong expansion in M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nShort-term market interest rates have registered\nmixed changes since the Committee meeting on November 13,\n1996, while long-term yields have risen slightly. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has\nrisen slightly over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 picked up in November, while expansion\nof M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October.\nFor the year through November, M2 is estimated to have\ngrown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's\nannual range, and M3 at a rate a little above the top of\nits range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded\nmoderately on balance over recent months and has remained\nin the middle portion of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997, the Committee\nagreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in\n1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth\nquarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nrelatively strong expansion in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMcTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, Mr. Stern,\nand Ms. Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday-Wednesday, February 4-5, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:40 p.m."
