By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market\n\nOperations shown below was reaffirmed.\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out\n\nthe most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the\n\nCommittee:\n\n2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\n\noperations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs\n\nthe Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in\n\nthe System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to\n\nbanks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements\n\nconducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as\n\nthe Committee may specify from time to time.\n\n(b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or\n\nto acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal\n\nReserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery\n\nbasis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at\n\nmarket discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up\n\nto nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the\n\ncurrent shipment of goods between countries or within the United\n\nStates, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of\n\ngoods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of\n\ntrade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their\n\nlife by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the\n\nunderlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers\n\nacceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million;\n\n(c) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are\n\ndirect obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and\n\ninterest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers\n\nacceptances of the types authorized for purchase under l(b) above,\n\nfrom dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nunder agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or\n\nacceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless\n\notherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined\n\nby competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the\n\nvolume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the\n\nevent Government securities or agency issues covered by any such\n\nagreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement\n\nor a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred\n\nto the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the\n\nevent bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not\n\nrepurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.\n\n3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\n\noperations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments\n\nfor foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal\n\nReserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes\n\nand directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open\n\nMarket Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and\n\ninternational accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under\n\nagreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those\n\nsecurities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those\n\navailable on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York\n\nBank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to\n\nthe conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in\n\nparagraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency\n\nsecurities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase\n\nagreements between its own account and foreign and international\n\naccounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such\n\naccounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a\n\nservice fee when appropriate.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency\n\nOperations shown below was reaffirmed.\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to\n\nthe extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency\n\ndirective and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant\n\nthereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the\n\nCommittee may issue from time to time:\n\nB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts\n\nto receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A\n\nabove.\n\nC. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw\n\ndollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph\n\n2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such\n\narrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any\n\namount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,\n\nbecause of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.\n\nD. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies\n\nnot exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open\n\nposition in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding\n\nsigns) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in\n\na single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that\n\ncurrency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus\n\noutstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as\n\nthe sum of these elements with due regard to sign.\n\n2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve\n\nBank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"\n\narrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a\n\nmaximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among\n\nthose designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\n\nSystem under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign\n\nBanks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew\n\nsuch arrangements on maturity:\n\nForeign bank Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank National Bank of Belgium Bank of Canada National Bank of Denmark Bank of England Bank of France German Federal Bank Bank of Italy Bank of Japan Bank of Mexico Netherlands Bank Bank of Norway Bank of Sweden Swiss National Bank 250 1,000 2,000 250 3,000 2,000 6,000 3,000 5,000 3,000 500 250 300 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250\n\nForeign bank\n\nAmount of arrangement (millions of dollars equivalent)\n\nAustrian National Bank National Bank of Belgium Bank of Canada National Bank of Denmark Bank of England Bank of France German Federal Bank Bank of Italy Bank of Japan Bank of Mexico Netherlands Bank Bank of Norway Bank of Sweden Swiss National Bank\n\n250 1,000 2,000 250 3,000 2,000 6,000 3,000 5,000 3,000 500 250 300 4,000\n\nBank for International Settlements:\n\nDollars against Swiss francs\n\n600\n\nDollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs\n\n1,250\n\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the\n\nproposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall\n\nbe referred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph\n\n1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the\n\nCommittee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of\n\nproviding an investment return on System holdings of foreign\n\ncurrencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or\n\nreceived in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign\n\ncentral banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.\n\n4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central\n\nbanks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In\n\nmaking operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System\n\nholdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nshall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless\n\nauthorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or\n\nunderstandings concerning the administration of the accounts\n\nmaintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign\n\nbanks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of\n\nRegulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the\n\nCommittee.\n\n5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as\n\npracticable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such\n\ninvestments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than\n\n12 months remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection with\n\narrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency\n\nholdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign\n\ncentral banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities\n\nwithin 30 calendar days.\n\n6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs\n\nshall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and\n\nthe Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the\n\nChairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the\n\nBoard of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman\n\nmay designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on\n\nthe Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as\n\nalternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,\n\nhis alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the\n\nrequest of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open\n\nMarket Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or\n\ncontemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other\n\nmatters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any\n\nmember of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and\n\nconsultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open\n\nMarket Committee.\n\n7. The Chairman is authorized:\n\nB. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning\n\nSystem foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary\n\non policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;\n\nC. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and\n\ninformation to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary\n\nand Financial Policies.\n\n8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit\n\npertinent information on System foreign currency operations to\n\nappropriate officials of the Treasury Department.\n\n9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign\n\ncurrency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3\n\nG(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to\n\nForeign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown below\n\nwas reaffirmed.\n\n1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be\n\ndirected at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that\n\nmarket exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior\n\nconsistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.\n\n2. To achieve this end the System shall:\n\n3. Transactions may also be undertaken:\n\nB. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with\n\nselected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International\n\nSettlements.\n\nC. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other\n\ncountries and with international monetary institutions.\n\nB. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments\n\nin particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange\n\nStabilization Fund.\n\nC. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the\n\nCommittee.\n\n4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:\n\nB. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary\n\nauthorities; and\n\nC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United\n\nStates in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange\n\narrangements under the IMF Article IV.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect\n\nto Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed.\n\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and\n\ndirection of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the\n\nAuthorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency\n\nDirective, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager,\n\nSystem Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the\n\nfollowing procedural understandings with respect to consultations and\n\nclearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and\n\nthe Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to\n\nsuch clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the\n\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\n\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the\n\nSystem's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150\n\nmillion, or $300 million when the operation is associated with\n\nrepayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of\n\ntrading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change\n\nin the System's net position in that currency might be less than the\n\nlimits specified in 1.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the\n\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\n\narrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the\n\nSubcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the\n\nfull Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the\n\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\n\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the\n\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\n\narrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the\n\nChairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any\n\noperations that are not of a routine character.\n\nAt its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee\n\nhad approved an increase from $5 billion to $20 billion in the amount\n\nof eligible foreign currencies that the System was prepared to\n\n\"warehouse\" for the Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund\n\n(ESF). The purpose of the warehousing facility, which has been in\n\nplace for many years, is to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of\n\nthe Treasury and the ESF for financing purchases of foreign currencies\n\nand related international operations. The enlargement of the\n\nwarehousing agreement was intended to facilitate U.S. participation in\n\nthe Multilateral Program to Restore Financial Stability in Mexico,\n\nannounced by President Clinton on January 31, 1995, by warehousing up\n\nto $20 billion in German marks and Japanese yen held by the Treasury\n\nthrough the ESF. The Committee had agreed that it would review each\n\nyear the need to maintain this level of warehousing authority in light\n\nof the progress and requirements of the Program.\n\nThe Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund had made no\n\nuse of the warehousing facility over the past year. Nevertheless,\n\nconsistent with Federal Reserve support for the program of assistance\n\nto Mexico, the members agreed that it was appropriate to postpone\n\nconsideration of an adjustment in the overall size of the facility at\n\nleast until the end of the disbursement phase of the Mexican program\n\ncurrently scheduled for August 1996. Accordingly, the Committee\n\nreaffirmed the warehousing authority by unanimous vote.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Program for Security of FOMC\n\nInformation was amended to conform it to the treatment of transcripts\n\nof FOMC meetings and the procedures that the Committee had been\n\nfollowing for some time in regard to redactions of confidential\n\ninformation in transcripts and other documents that are released to\n\nthe public after five years. In addition, the Committee agreed to\n\namend the Program so that the automatic extension of Federal Reserve\n\nstaff access to confidential material after six months could be\n\nsuspended for certain particularly sensitive documents.\n\nOn January 23, 1996, the continuing rules, resolutions, and\n\nother instruments of the Committee had been distributed with the\n\nadvice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee,\n\nthey were being called to the Committee's attention before the January\n\n30-31 organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any\n\nquestions they might have concerning them. Members were asked to\n\nindicate if they wished to have any of the instruments in question\n\nplaced on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no\n\nrequests for such consideration were received.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\n\nOpen Market Committee held on December 19, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\n\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets. He indicated that\n\nthe swap line drawing by the Bank of Mexico had been repaid in full on\n\nJanuary 29, 1996. The Committee ratified that transaction by\n\nunanimous vote.\n\nThe Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic\n\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in U.S.\n\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\n\nDecember 19, 1995, through January 30, 1996. By unanimous vote, the\n\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\n\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in\n\n1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\n\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\n\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\n\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\n\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\n\nNew York.\n\nOnly a limited amount of new information was available for\n\nthis meeting because of delays in government releases; that which was\n\navailable, along with anecdotal commentary, suggested that the economy\n\nhad been growing relatively slowly in recent months. Consumer\n\nspending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business invest-\n\nment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently,\n\nand housing demand seemed to have leveled out. Slower growth in final\n\nsales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these\n\nbuildups, together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and\n\nsevere weather, were having a restraining effect on economic activity.\n\nThe demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and\n\nthe unemployment rate remained relatively low. The recent data on\n\nprices and wages had been mixed, but there was no firm evidence of a\n\nchange in underlying inflation trends.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in\n\nDecember; the gain was in line with the average monthly increase for\n\n1995. Employment in manufacturing, boosted by the settlement of a\n\nstrike at a major aircraft manufacturer, reversed the declines of\n\nOctober and November. Construction payrolls rose further in December,\n\ndespite unfavorable weather in some parts of the country. Job growth\n\nremained solid in much of the services industry, although employment\n\nat personnel supply firms was little changed. The civilian unemploy-\n\nment rate remained at 5.6 percent in December.\n\nIndustrial production edged up in December and for the fourth\n\nquarter as a whole advanced only slightly; industrial activity\n\nremained sluggish in January according to the limited statistical\n\ninformation that was available. In December, manufacturing output\n\nrose a bit in association with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies\n\nand aircraft production. Elsewhere in manufacturing, the growth of\n\noutput of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the\n\nrapid pace of previous months, and the production of defense and space\n\nequipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable\n\ndeclines. The output of utilities was boosted somewhat in December by\n\nthe effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for\n\nheating services. Utilization of total industrial capacity fell\n\nslightly but remained at a moderately elevated level.\n\nRetail sales continued to grow at a relatively modest rate in\n\nDecember, and the fourth-quarter increase was considerably smaller\n\nthan those of the previous two quarters. In the fourth quarter, lower\n\nspending at general merchandisers offset much of the sales gains\n\nregistered at automotive dealerships, furniture and appliance stores,\n\nand building and supply outlets. Consumer surveys indicated some\n\ndeterioration in consumer confidence in January. Recent indicators\n\nof housing demand and activity were mixed. Sales of new homes edged\n\nstill lower in November (latest data available), and sales of existing\n\nhomes declined by a larger amount in December than in November.\n\nHowever, housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October\n\ndecline, and conditions in mortgage markets remained quite favorable,\n\nled by a further decline in rates.\n\nThe sparse statistical data available on business fixed\n\ninvestment, along with anecdotal information, suggested a moderation\n\nrecently in the expansion of business spending on capital goods,\n\nincluding some slowing of investment in computers. Investment in\n\ntransportation equipment, however, apparently had held up well in the\n\nfourth quarter. Incoming data on construction contracts pointed to\n\nsome slowing in the growth of nonresidential building activity from a\n\nrelatively brisk pace during most of 1995.\n\nThe information available on business inventories suggested\n\nthat inventory imbalances might have emerged in a few sectors in\n\nassociation with weaker-than-expected sales. Motor vehicle\n\ninventories were at elevated levels compared with sales in late 1995,\n\nand manufacturers responded by offering incentive packages on new cars\n\nand trucks and by adjusting downward their January production\n\nschedules. Data on manufacturing and retail trade inventories for\n\nNovember had been delayed, but published information on inventories\n\nheld by wholesale distributors indicated a decline in that month,\n\nreversing part of October's sizable run-up. Much of the decline\n\noccurred in nondurable goods, although machinery distributors also\n\nreported a sizable liquidation. The inventory-sales ratio for the\n\nwholesale trade sector edged down in November but remained near the\n\nhigh end of its range in recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\n\nnarrowed in October from its average rate in the third quarter. The\n\nvalue of imports declined by more than the value of exports. Much of\n\nthe contraction in imports reflected reductions in oil and automotive\n\nproducts that more than offset another strong rise in computer goods.\n\nFor exports, an advance in machinery exports to record levels was\n\noutweighed by a reduction in shipments of agricultural and automotive\n\nproducts. Available data on economic activity in the major foreign\n\nindustrial countries suggested that the pace of expansion in Europe\n\nhad slowed further on average while growth in Japan had picked up a\n\nlittle.\n\nRecent data suggested little change in underlying inflation\n\ntrends. Consumer prices increased slightly in December after being\n\nunchanged in November; food prices were quiescent over the two-month\n\nperiod while energy prices rose on balance, with a December rebound\n\nmore than offsetting a sizable November drop. Excluding food and\n\nenergy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the November-\n\nDecember period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in\n\n1994. Producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in\n\nNovember and December after having risen slowly in earlier months; in\n\nlarge part, the price increases late in the year reflected sharp\n\nupward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices.\n\nFor 1995, producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy\n\nrose at a subdued pace, though somewhat more than in 1994. Commodity\n\nprices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier. Average\n\nhourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased\n\nsomewhat in December after having been unchanged in November.\n\nIncreases in average hourly earnings had been trending up over the\n\npast several years.\n\nAt its meeting on December 19, 1995, the Committee adopted a\n\ndirective that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure\n\non reserve positions, which was expected to result in a decline in the\n\nfederal funds rate from around 5-3/4 percent to around 5-1/2 percent.\n\nThe directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction\n\nof any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.\n\nAccordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the\n\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\n\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\n\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\n\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable\n\nduring the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated\n\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate\n\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAfter the meeting, open market operations were directed\n\ninitially toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of\n\nreserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee and thereafter\n\ntoward maintaining this new reserve posture. Operations were\n\ncomplicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with year-\n\nend pressures and the adverse effects of unusually severe winter\n\nweather on check clearings. Although the federal funds rate exhibited\n\nsomewhat greater volatility than normal over the period, it\n\nnonetheless averaged close to the expected level of 5-1/2 percent.\n\nThe occasional periods of firmness in reserve market conditions\n\ncontributed to higher adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, on average,\n\nover the period.\n\nMost market interest rates had declined somewhat further over\n\nthe period after the December 19 meeting. Rates moved lower\n\nimmediately after the policy easing action, and most fell still more\n\non balance over the remainder of the intermeeting interval in response\n\nto incoming information about the economy and the prospects for fiscal\n\npolicy, at least in the near term. Both were seen as suggesting\n\nslower economic expansion for a time and an increased likelihood of\n\nadditional easing of monetary policy in coming months. With bond\n\nyields down on balance, and occasionally approaching two-year lows,\n\nmajor indexes of equity prices advanced sharply further.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\n\nG-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite\n\nthe decline in U.S. interest rates. The dollar's upward movement\n\nagainst the German mark and other European currencies was associated\n\nwith increasing indications of further weakening of economic expansion\n\nin key European countries and greater declines in interest rates in\n\nthose countries than in the United States. The dollar's appreciation\n\nrelative to the Japanese yen appeared to be related in part to a\n\nnarrowing of Japan's trade and current account surpluses. The dollar\n\nwas unchanged on balance against the Canadian dollar, while the\n\nMexican peso rose considerably in relation to the dollar.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January.\n\nThe pickup in M2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines\n\nin short-term interest rates; those declines had made money market\n\ninstruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in\n\nM2, whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a\n\nconsiderable lag. In addition, the flattening of the term structure\n\nof interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond\n\nmutual funds, which had continued to experience only light inflows.\n\nFaster growth of M3 in December and January was associated with both\n\nthe pickup in M2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time\n\ndeposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in\n\nJanuary. The expansion of M2 from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the\n\nfourth quarter of 1995 was in the upper half of the Committee's annual\n\nrange, and M3 grew at the upper end of its range. Growth of total\n\ndomestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months, and for\n\nthe year was near the midpoint of this aggregate's monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\n\neconomic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near\n\nterm. This forecast was not materially different from that prepared\n\nfor the December meeting, except for a slightly weaker outlook for the\n\ncurrent quarter that was related in part to an inventory correction\n\nand the effects of unusually severe winter weather on spending and\n\noutput. Over the remainder of the two-year forecast horizon, the\n\neconomy was expected to grow generally along its estimated potential.\n\nConsumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of\n\ndisposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer\n\ndebt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of\n\ncredit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity\n\nholdings would support further increases in consumption. The further\n\ndecline in mortgage rates recently from already-favorable levels would\n\nhelp to sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level.\n\nWith sales and profits projected to grow more slowly, and with\n\nutilization of existing capacity having eased considerably, business\n\ninvestment in new equipment and structures was expected to expand at a\n\nmore moderate rate. In light of the recent strengthening of the\n\ndollar, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining\n\ninfluence on real activity over the projection period as a whole.\n\nMuch uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the recent\n\nimpasse in the budget negotiations between the Administration and the\n\nCongress suggested a lower degree of fiscal restraint over coming\n\nyears than had been assumed in the previous forecast. Given the\n\nprojected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources\n\nand of inflation were not expected to change materially.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\n\neconomic activity, members noted a number of temporary factors that\n\nwere retarding the expansion. The weakness in business activity this\n\nwinter was to some extent the result of the partial shutdown of the\n\nfederal government and the severe storms in a number of regions; both\n\nclearly were transitory influences on the economy. Growth of economic\n\nactivity also was being constrained by production cutbacks stemming\n\nfrom efforts to bring stocks into better alignment with disappointing\n\nsales in a number of industries. Even so, in the absence of major\n\noverhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables,\n\nand given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed\n\nthat a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively\n\nbrief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy.\n\nAt the same time, many observed that the risks to such an outcome did\n\nnot seem balanced. A number of concerns, including the extent of the\n\ndamping effects of high debt loads and employment uncertainty on\n\nconsumption and questions about the sources of further export growth,\n\nsuggested the possibility of sluggish expansion, while possible\n\ndevelopments on the upside were more difficult to identify. With\n\nresource use unlikely to vary appreciably, the members generally\n\nexpected no significant change in the underlying inflation picture\n\nover the year ahead. The recent performance of inflation had some\n\nencouraging aspects, and the odds on greater price pressures seemed\n\nrelatively small at this time.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\n\nestablishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt\n\naggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank\n\npresidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual\n\nprojections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and\n\ninflation for the year 1996. Measured on the basis of chain-weighted\n\nindexes, the forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central\n\ntendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2\n\npercent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth\n\nquarter of 1996. The members and nonmember presidents generally\n\nanticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would\n\nbe associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force.\n\nAccordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in\n\nthe fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central\n\ntendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6\n\npercent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as reflected in the\n\nconsumer price index, had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent;\n\nthat central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995--\n\nwhen the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food\n\nprices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts\n\nanticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation.\n\nIn their review of developments across the nation, the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents reported modest growth in most major\n\nareas of the country. Many referred, however, to an admixture of\n\nstrengths and weaknesses in their local economies, and a majority\n\nobserved that on balance growth in regional business activity appeared\n\nto have slowed in the last few months. In keeping with the data\n\navailable for the nation as a whole, the slowing seemed to be\n\nconcentrated in manufacturing and especially at firms producing motor\n\nvehicles and parts. Some presidents referred to relatively negative,\n\nor at least cautious, sentiment among many of their business contacts.\n\nMuch of the recent softening in economic activity appeared to\n\narise from production cutbacks in various sectors of the economy where\n\ninvoluntary accumulation of inventories seemed to have occurred as a\n\nresult of weaker sales trends in the past few months. The members\n\nexpected this inventory adjustment process to have a relatively\n\npronounced effect on production and overall business activity in the\n\ncurrent quarter and perhaps to some extent in the second. While a\n\ngreater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects\n\nthrough the economy could not be ruled out, the underlying strength of\n\ndemand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate\n\ngrowth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and\n\nproduction adjustments subsided.\n\nWith regard to consumer spending, members referred to overall\n\nindications of lackluster retail sales during the holiday season and\n\ninto January. The anecdotal commentary on retail sales attributed\n\nsome of the recent weakness in a number of areas to the clearly\n\ntemporary effects of unusually severe winter weather and the partial\n\nshutdown of the federal government. The members anticipated that\n\nmoderate growth in retail sales would resume, though some felt that\n\nthe consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside. The\n\nconsumer spending outlook was complicated by a number of\n\ncrosscurrents. Negative factors cited by the members included ongoing\n\nconcerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing\n\nstream of workforce reduction announcements by major business\n\nconcerns, increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in\n\nrising delinquency rates on some types of loans, and the apparent\n\nsatisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer\n\ndurables. On the positive side, reduced interest rates, still readily\n\navailable credit, and the accumulation of financial wealth from the\n\nsharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support\n\ncontinuing gains in consumer spending.\n\nFurther increases in business fixed investment were viewed as\n\na likely prospect for the year ahead, though the growth of such\n\ninvestment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced\n\nearlier in the current cyclical expansion. Anecdotal reports\n\nindicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some\n\nparts of the country, but declining rates of capacity utilization\n\naugured reduced growth going forward. The expansion of investment in\n\nproducers' durable equipment also was expected to slow, but from a\n\npace that had seemed unsustainable. While appreciable further growth\n\ncould be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business\n\nfirms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their\n\noperations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other\n\ntypes of equipment was likely to be sluggish. Members noted in\n\nparticular the prospects for weaker business spending for motor\n\nvehicles, especially for heavy trucks. However, the fundamental\n\ndeterminants of investment in business equipment, including the\n\nreduced cost of financing such investment, remained positive and this\n\nsector of the economy should continue to provide considerable impetus\n\nto the expansion.\n\nThe members also viewed the considerable decline that had\n\noccurred in mortgage interest rates and the ample availability of\n\nhousing finance as key factors in their forecasts of sustained\n\nresidential construction at relatively high levels. Adverse weather\n\nconditions appeared to have retarded home building activity in a\n\nnumber of areas in recent weeks, but several members commented that\n\nunderlying trends in housing demand were favorable and that\n\nresidential construction had remained relatively strong in several\n\nparts of the country.\n\nThe outlook for fiscal policy was uncertain, especially with\n\nregard to whether longer-term spending and taxation measures would be\n\nenacted to implement the goal of a balanced federal budget by the year\n\n2002. For the year immediately ahead, however, the members continued\n\nto anticipate considerable restraint in federal spending, partly as a\n\nbyproduct of the current budget debate between the Congress and the\n\nAdministration. With regard to the external sector of the economy,\n\nprospects for economic growth in major trading partners--led by\n\ndevelopments in Europe--appeared to have weakened, and the recent\n\nappreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets also might\n\ntend to damp net exports. Consequently, several members saw downside\n\nrisks in the foreign trade sector over the year ahead.\n\nThe members anticipated that inflation would remain contained\n\nin 1996, but they did not expect significant progress toward more\n\nstable prices. They referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook\n\nfor wages and prices in the year ahead. Factors pointing to\n\npotentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food\n\nprices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and\n\nrelatively low grain supplies. More generally, resource utilization\n\nwas expected to remain high and greater pressures could emerge in\n\nlabor and product markets. Members noted that one broad measure of\n\nwages had picked up and that there was a small rise in the number of\n\nanecdotal reports indicating that labor shortages were contributing to\n\nhigher wages in some parts of the country. In addition, unusually\n\nmuted increases in the costs of worker benefits had been holding down\n\noverall compensation costs, and this pattern might not persist. On\n\nthe other hand, high levels of resource utilization had been\n\nassociated for some time with lower rates of growth in costs than\n\nwould have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience. In\n\nparticular, a general sense of job insecurity in a period of major\n\nbusiness restructurings was holding down increases in labor\n\ncompensation. In an environment of strong competition, which was\n\npreventing many businesses from passing on rising costs through higher\n\nprices, firms continued to focus on efforts to control costs by\n\nimproving the efficiency of their operations, and this was helping to\n\nhold down inflation. An apparent decline in inflationary expectations\n\nalso would provide a moderating influence on inflation trends in the\n\nperiod ahead. While most of the members saw little reason to\n\nanticipate appreciably lower inflation over the year ahead, they also\n\nviewed the odds on a pickup in inflation as fairly low; they could see\n\npossible reasons for optimism on the long-run trend in inflation; and\n\nthey generally remained confident that further progress toward price\n\nstability would be made over the longer term.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\n\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\n\nreviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in\n\n1996 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in\n\nJuly 1995. The tentative ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent\n\nfor M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of\n\n1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth\n\nof total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7\n\npercent for 1996. The tentative ranges for 1996 were unchanged from\n\nthe actual ranges for 1995. In July, the range for M3 had been raised\n\nby two percentage points to reflect developments that seemed to be\n\nfostering a return to the historical pattern of somewhat faster growth\n\nin M3 than in M2.\n\nIn their discussion, the members took note of a staff\n\nanalysis which indicated that monetary expansion consistent with the\n\nmoderate growth of nominal GDP that the members were projecting for\n\n1996 most likely would be around the upper ends of the tentative\n\nranges adopted last July. M2 and M3 velocity over the past couple of\n\nyears had conformed more closely on balance with historical patterns,\n\nand the projections assumed that this behavior would continue in\n\n1996. In light of the experience of earlier years, however, when the\n\nvelocities of these aggregates had exhibited pronounced atypical\n\nbehavior, substantial uncertainty still surrounded any projections of\n\nmonetary expansion and the linkage between particular rates of money\n\ngrowth and the basic objectives of monetary policy.\n\nMost members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low\n\nranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1996 that the Committee had set on a\n\ntentative basis in July 1995. These members favored retention of the\n\ntentative ranges because they could be viewed as benchmarks for money\n\ngrowth that would be associated with price stability, assuming\n\nbehavior of velocity in line with historical experience, and a\n\nreaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the Committee's\n\ncommitment to a policy of achieving price stability over the longer\n\nterm. Some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to\n\nalign them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with\n\nthe Committee's expectations for expansion of the economy and prices\n\nin 1996 could be misinterpreted. Such an action might be seen as\n\nsuggesting that the Committee had a greater degree of confidence in\n\nthe relationship between money growth and broad measures of economic\n\nperformance than was warranted by its current understanding of that\n\nrelationship or that the Committee was now placing greater emphasis on\n\nthe broad monetary aggregates as a gauge of the thrust of monetary\n\npolicy.\n\nTwo members favored somewhat higher growth ranges for M2 and\n\nM3 in 1996. They noted that the expansion of these broad aggregates\n\nwas anticipated to be around the upper ends of their tentative ranges,\n\nand perhaps even higher, given the Committee's expectations for the\n\nperformance of the economy and prices. In their view, the higher\n\nranges would be more consistent with what they saw as the Committee's\n\nobligations under the Federal Reserve Act to set ranges consistent\n\nwith expected or desired economic outcomes for the year, and the\n\nreasons for establishing those ranges could easily be set forth and\n\nunderstood as an appropriate technical adjustment that would not imply\n\nany lessened commitment to the Committee's price stability goal.\n\nThe Committee unanimously preferred to retain the 3 to 7\n\npercent range for total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1996. This\n\nposition took account of a staff projection indicating that the debt\n\naggregate was likely to continue to grow at a rate generally in line\n\nwith the expansion of nominal GDP, although some moderation in private\n\ncredit demands was anticipated and there were indications that lenders\n\nwere no longer easing their terms and conditions for granting credit\n\nto consumers and businesses.\n\nAt the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee voted to\n\napprove without change the tentative ranges for 1996 that it had\n\nestablished in July of last year. In keeping with its usual procedures\nunder the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its\n\nranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light\n\nof the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing\n\neconomic and financial developments. Accordingly, the following\n\nlonger-run policy statement for 1995 was approved for inclusion in\n\nthe domestic policy directive:\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\n\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, McTeer, Ms.\n\nPhillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Lindsey and\n\nMs. Yellen.\n\nMr. Lindsey and Ms. Yellen dissented because they preferred\n\nsomewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3. They recognized that the\n\nrelationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad\n\nmeasures of economic performance were subject to substantial\n\nuncertainty, but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis\n\nin July 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion\n\nconsistent with the central tendency of members' current forecasts of\n\nnominal GDP growth for 1996. Raising the ranges for M2 and M3 would\n\nin their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in\n\nthe Federal Reserve Act that require the System to communicate to the\n\nCongress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for\n\nthe calendar year. They believed the Committee could readily explain\n\nthat such an adjustment to the ranges did not represent a lessened\n\ncommitment to its price stability goal or an increased emphasis on the\n\nmonetary aggregates in policy formulation.\n\nThe Committee also discussed alternatives to the monetary\n\naggregates for communicating its intentions with regard to the course\n\nof inflation over the longer run. Some members thought that explicit\n\nnumerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years\n\nwould have several important benefits, including enhanced credibility\n\nthat could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater\n\nflexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing\n\npolicy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation\n\nconcerns. Other members, while endorsing fully the long-term goal of\n\nprice stability, had a number of reservations about implementing such\n\nproposals, especially at this time. Based on experience in the United\n\nStates and elsewhere, many were skeptical about the payoff in terms of\n\ngreater credibility or flexibility in policy implementation.\n\nMoreover, they believed that substantially more study and deliberation\n\nwere required to explore fully the alternatives and the consequences\n\nof changes in the way the Committee formulated and communicated its\n\nobjectives. They also thought that any such assessment would need to\n\ntake account of the prospects for, or disposition of, closely related\n\nlegislation that was now being considered in the Congress. The\n\nCommittee did not take any action on this issue at this meeting, but\n\nit recognized that the matter would need to be revisited from time to\n\ntime.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\n\nperiod ahead, the members supported a proposal calling for some slight\n\neasing in reserve conditions. Although a pickup to an acceptable rate\n\nof expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in\n\ncoming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to\n\nbe significant. At the same time, while most members were forecasting\n\nhigh levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation\n\nthis year, they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move\n\nmight foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances, and some\n\nfelt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved\n\ninflation performance. Under the circumstances, a slight decrease was\n\nwarranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of\n\nmembers considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed\n\nless appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of\n\na pickup in inflation. One member pointed out that such a decrease\n\nwould tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent\n\nrise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which might continue\n\nto move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were\n\nnot forthcoming. It was noted that postponing a decision in this\n\nuncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more\n\nevidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy\n\nwas quite temporary or more lasting; if it was the former,\n\ninflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates. On\n\nthe other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish\n\nperformance of the economy could be read as calling for a more\n\npronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to\n\npolicy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that\n\nsurrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy.\n\nThe Chairman informed the Committee that he had asked the\n\nmembers of the Board of Governors to convene immediately after this\n\nmeeting to consider a reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the\n\ndiscount rate. Such a reduction had been proposed by a total of six\n\nFederal Reserve Banks at this point. Given the easing in reserve\n\nmarkets favored by the Committee and the possibility of a lower\n\ndiscount rate, the members did not believe that a further policy move\n\nwas likely to be needed during the intermeeting period. Accordingly,\n\nthey favored an unbiased directive that did not incorporate a\n\npresumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy\n\nduring the next several weeks. In keeping with its usual practice,\n\nthe Committee did not rule out the possibility of an intermeeting\n\npolicy change on the basis of unanticipated economic or financial\n\ndevelopments.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\n\nmembers supported a directive that called for a slight reduction in\n\nthe degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a\n\nbias about the likely direction of an adjustment to policy during the\n\nintermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a\n\nchange in policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided that in the\n\ncontext of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\n\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\n\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly\n\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\n\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\n\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\n\ncoming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\n\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\n\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\n\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have declined somewhat\n\nsince the Committee meeting on December 19. In foreign\n\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\n\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen\n\nfurther over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and\n\nJanuary. From the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth\n\nquarter of 1995, M2 expanded in the upper half of its\n\nrange and M3 grew at the upper end of its range.\n\nGrowth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been\n\nmoderate in recent months, placing this aggregate near\n\nthe midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\n\nand financial conditions that will foster price stabil-\n\nity and promote sustainable growth in output. In\n\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\n\nmeeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n\n1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively,\n\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth\n\nquarter of 1996. The monitoring range for growth of\n\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7\n\npercent for the year. The behavior of the monetary\n\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\n\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\n\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\n\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\n\nfuture, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the\n\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions,\n\ntaking account of a possible reduction in the discount\n\nrate. In the context of the Committee's long-run\n\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic\n\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\n\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\n\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint\n\nwould be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\n\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\n\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\n\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for short-run policy:\n\nMessrs.\n\nGreenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley,\n\nLindsey, McTeer, Ms. Phillips, Mr. Stern and Ms.\n\nYellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\n\nTuesday, March 26, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m.\n\n-Attended portions of meeting relating to the Committee's review of\n\nthe economic outlook and establishment of its monetary and debt\n\nranges for 1996."
