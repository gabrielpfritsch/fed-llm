By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1998\nand 1999, and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion in economic activity had slowed considerably after a very\nrapid advance in the first quarter. Much of the slowdown reflected a\nsubstantial moderation in business inventory accumulation. Consumer\nspending, business investment, and residential homebuilding, though\nremaining robust, apparently also were decelerating somewhat after\nvery strong gains in the first quarter; and the erosion in net exports\ncontinued to damp demand for domestically produced goods. Payroll\nemployment persisted on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production\nseemed likely to record only modest further expansion in the second\nquarter. Labor markets remained tight, and there were indications of\nsome further acceleration in employment costs. Recent data on\nconsumer prices were a little less favorable than they had been\nearlier in the year.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment registered substantial increases\nin April and May despite further job losses in manufacturing.\nConstruction payrolls declined in May, but they were up sharply on\nbalance over the April-May period following substantial gains earlier\nin the year. Employment increases in service-producing industries,\nnotably business services and retail and wholesale trade, continued to\nbe robust. The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.3 percent in\nMay, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low\nthrough mid-June, after taking into account the onset of layoffs\nassociated with the strike at General Motors.\n\nIndustrial production picked up in April and May after\nchanging little in the first quarter, but the strike at General Motors\nlikely depressed industrial production substantially in June. In\nmanufacturing, the output of motor vehicles rose briskly on balance\nover April and May, and the production of computers and office\nequipment remained robust. Growth in the manufacture of materials\nslowed sharply, perhaps reflecting the effects of reduced exports to\nAsia. Output of utilities, which continued to fluctuate widely,\nchanged little on balance over the April-May period. The rate of\nutilization of manufacturing capacity edged down in May to its lowest\nlevel in more than two years as capacity grew at a faster rate than\noutput.\n\nTotal nominal retail sales posted large gains in April and\nMay. Sales were strong at automotive dealers in response to a sharp\nincrease in incentives offered by the Big Three automakers. Sales\nalso rose briskly at building material and supply outlets and at\ngeneral merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance stores.\nAlthough the growth in real outlays for services in April (latest data\navailable) was held down by a small decline in purchases of energy\nservices, the expansion of outlays for non-energy services remained\nbrisk. Sales of homes were very strong in April and May, but housing\nstarts and building permits declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted\nbasis from their elevated first-quarter rates.\n\nAvailable information suggested that the growth of business\nfixed investment slowed somewhat in the second quarter from a very\nstrong pace earlier in the year. A deceleration in expenditures for\nproducers' durable equipment, after the surge in purchases of computer\nand communications equipment in the first quarter, apparently more\nthan offset a pickup in spending on nonresidential structures. The\nrecent upturn in building activity was consistent with the continuing\nindications of declining vacancy rates and rising real estate prices,\nbut available data on construction contracts did not point to further\nstrength in nonresidential construction.\n\nBusiness inventory investment slowed sharply in April from\nthe extraordinarily rapid rate of accumulation in the first quarter.\nIn manufacturing, stockbuilding picked up somewhat in April from the\nfirst-quarter pace, but with sales also rising, the stock-sales ratio\nremained at a very low level. Wholesale inventories declined sharply\nin April, primarily reflecting runoffs in stocks of motor vehicles;\nthe inventory-sales ratio for the sector remained near the upper end\nof its range over the preceding twelve months. Retail inventory\naccumulation slowed somewhat in April, and the aggregate inventory-\nsales ratio stayed close to the lower end of its range over the past\nyear.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened further in April, as the value of exports declined more than\nthat of imports. Exports of aircraft and parts dropped sharply from\nthe first-quarter level, and exports of industrial supplies decreased\nby lesser amounts. Most of the decline in imports was in capital\ngoods and automotive products. Recent information suggested a mixed\neconomic performance among the major foreign industrial countries.\nEconomic activity in Japan contracted sharply in the first quarter\nafter declining slightly in the fourth quarter, and many other\neconomies in Asia remained quite weak. The Asian crises held down\nexports of the major European countries, partly offsetting the\ninfluence of strong domestic demand.\n\nConsumer prices advanced at a slightly faster rate in May as\nan upturn in energy prices and a large increase in food prices more\nthan offset a slower rate of increase in the prices of nonfood, non-\nenergy items. Core consumer prices accelerated during the three\nmonths ended in May, largely reflecting higher tobacco prices and\nshelter costs. Nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the\ntwelve months ended in May than they had over the previous twelve\nmonths. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than\nfood and energy continued to rise at a subdued rate in May. For the\ntwelve months ended in May, core producer prices rose by a small\namount after having changed little in the year-earlier period. At the\nintermediate level, core producer prices edged down in May and were\nlittle changed on net over the twelve months ended in May. Average\nhourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased at a\nslightly faster rate on balance over April and May. Measured on a\nyear-over-year basis, average hourly earnings accelerated further in\nthe year ended in May. The largest gains were in business services\nand finance, insurance, and real estate, but marked acceleration also\nwas evident in wholesale and retail trade. By contrast, gains in\nmanufacturing had changed little over the past three years.\n\nAt its meeting on May 19, 1998, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to\naverage around 5-1/2 percent. In light of concerns that growth in\naggregate demand might remain so strong relative to the expansion of\nthe economy's potential that inflationary pressures would tend to be\ngenerated, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive\ntilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher\nfederal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation\nin the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the\nintermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged close to the\nintended level of 5-1/2 percent. Market participants interpreted the\nfurther turmoil in financial markets in Asia and emerging market\neconomies elsewhere as damping the outlook for U.S. economic growth\nand improving the chances that inflation would remain low. While most\nshort-term interest rates changed little on balance over the period,\nyields on longer-term Treasury securities, and to a lesser extent on\nprivate debt instruments, declined somewhat, at least partly\nreflecting a further flight to safety and quality from renewed\nturbulence in a number of foreign markets. Share prices in U.S.\nequity markets remained volatile, and changes in major indexes were\nmixed on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of other major currencies continued to increase\nthrough the middle of June, but it then retraced much of that rise,\nending the intermeeting period somewhat higher on balance. The recent\nfluctuations in the dollar's trade-weighted value were largely\naccounted for by movements in the Japanese yen, which reached an\neight-year low against the dollar in the middle of June in response to\ngrowing market pessimism about the prospects for a prompt resolution\nof Japan's financial sector problems and for economic recovery in that\ncountry. The yen rebounded in mid-June in response to coordinated\nintervention by the Japanese and U.S. governments but soon renewed its\ndownward drift, partly as a result of rising concerns that the\nJapanese government would not take prompt action to address weaknesses\nin the country's banking sector and in aggregate demand; the yen\nfinished the period substantially lower on balance. The dollar\nchanged little on net against the German mark and other continental\nEuropean currencies; declines in long-term interest rates in those\ncountries generally matched the drop in yields on comparable U.S.\ninstruments. Against the backdrop of the weakness in the yen, the\ncurrencies of key emerging market economies, particularly some of\nthose in Asia, fell further against the dollar.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter but remained\nfairly robust. Households accumulated unusually large deposit\nbalances to make hefty nonwithheld tax payments in April, and these\nbalances ran off in May as tax checks cleared; averaging through these\ngyrations, the expansion of the broad aggregates slowed on balance\nover April and May, and preliminary data suggest further slowing in\nJune. The growth of M3 remained a little faster than that of M2,\nreflecting the further progress made by institution-only money market\nfunds in attracting corporate cash-management business. For the year\nthrough June, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's\nranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt\nappeared to have moderated somewhat after picking up earlier in the\nyear; the moderation evidently reflected some slowing in the growth of\nbusiness and household borrowing as well as paydowns of federal debt\nmade possible by robust tax revenues.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that\neconomic activity would expand more slowly over the projection period\nthan it had in recent years. Moderation in business inventory\ninvestment would damp domestic production as inventory accumulation\nwas brought into better balance with the expected more moderate\ntrajectory of final sales. In addition, reduced growth of foreign\neconomic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise\nin the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place\nsubstantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to lead to\nfurther substitution of imports for domestic products. The staff\nanalysis suggested that the prospective gains in income coupled with\nthe run-up that had occurred in household wealth would support further\nbrisk, though gradually diminishing, increases in consumer spending.\nHousing demand was expected to remain at a generally high level in the\ncontext of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home\nownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the\nprojection period would damp homebuilding somewhat. Growth in\nbusiness fixed investment would gradually moderate from the vigorous\npace of the first half of the year in response to smaller increases in\nbusiness sales and profits. Pressures on labor resources were likely\nto diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but\nunderlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually as gains in\ncompensation increasingly outpaced improvements in productivity.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, the members generally agreed that the expansion\nin economic activity was likely to be relatively moderate over coming\nquarters, and that such growth would be consistent with some limited\nincrease in inflation from the current unusually low level. The\naccumulation of business inventories, which until recently had added\nsubstantially to economic growth, was expected to continue at a much\nlower and more sustainable pace. Moreover, the effects on the\nU.S. trade balance of the appreciated value of the dollar and of\neconomic weakness in several of the nation's trading partners probably\nwould hold down increases in domestic output in coming quarters. Many\nof the members commented, however, that the already substantial risks\nsurrounding the economic outlook had increased on both sides of their\nforecasts. On the downside, the greater risks focused on potential\ndevelopments in Asia. Financial and economic conditions in Asia had\ndeteriorated in recent months, and the members could not rule out the\npossible emergence of even greater financial turmoil and economic\nweakness in that part of the world that could spill over to other\ncountries including the United States. On the upside, in the absence\nof strongly retarding effects from developments in Asia, persistent\nstrength in domestic final demand might well add to inflationary\npressures. Indeed, there were signs of modestly rising inflation in\nsome recent measures of prices, though the rate of inflation was still\nrelatively subdued.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nsets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the\nmembers of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not\ncurrently serving as members provided individual projections of the\ngrowth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate\nof inflation for the years 1998 and 1999. The forecasts of the rate\nof expansion in real GDP for 1998 as a whole had a central tendency of\n3 to 3-1/4 percent, which implied some moderation over the second half\nfrom staff estimates at the time of this meeting of the average rate\nof growth in the first and second quarters; for 1999 the forecasts\npointed to moderate growth and were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2\npercent. These projected rates of economic growth were accompanied by\na very slight rise in the civilian rate of unemployment over the next\n18 months to still quite low rates centering on 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent\nin the fourth quarter of 1999. With regard to the growth of nominal\nGDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for\n1998 and 4-1/4 to 5 percent for 1999. Projections of the rate of\ninflation, as measured by the consumer price index, indicated a\nslightly faster rise over the second half of this year and in 1999,\nlargely because of expectations that the plunge in energy prices\nearlier in the year would not be repeated. Specifically, the\nprojections converged on CPI inflation rates of 1-3/4 to 2 percent for\n1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 per cent in 1999.\n\nIn their review of developments in different parts of the\ncountry, Reserve Bank presidents reported high levels of business\nactivity across the nation, but several also indicated that there were\nsigns of some slowing in the expansion of regional economic activity.\nWith regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels\nof employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in\nconsumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp\nincreases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of\nthe extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the\nappreciation of home prices. However, some anecdotal and other\nevidence suggested that retail sales had moderated in recent weeks in\nat least some areas; the moderation appeared to be only partly\nassociated with the work stoppage at General Motors. The apparent\ndeceleration in retail sales could prove to be temporary, though some\nslowing in the growth of overall consumer spending over the forecast\nhorizon, perhaps to a pace more in line with the growth of disposable\nincome, was viewed as a reasonable expectation, especially with equity\nprice gains of recent years unlikely to be repeated.\n\nBusiness fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend,\nbuoyed by several favorable factors. The latter included the ready\navailability of debt and equity financing on relatively attractive\nterms, and opportunities to invest in high-tech equipment at lower\nprices to enhance productivity and hold down labor costs in a period\nof very tight labor markets. While these factors were expected to\ncontinue to support appreciable further expansion in business\ninvestment, growth in demand for capital goods was likely to diminish\nas a result of the projected slowing in the expansion of final sales\nand business profits and the absence of pressure on manufacturing\ncapacity. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction,\nmembers reported that declining vacancy rates and rising prices and\nrents of office buildings and to some extent other commercial\nstructures were fostering very high levels of construction activity in\nseveral areas. Moreover, there were indications that some\nconstruction projects were being delayed because of scarcities of\nlabor or construction materials. A number of members commented that\nsome of the construction was being undertaken on a speculative basis\nand that the strong pace of building activity pointed to overbuilding\nin some areas. On the residential side, construction activity also\ndisplayed considerable strength across much of the country. There\nwere widespread anecdotal and other reports of high levels of home\nsales and few reports of faltering housing demand. Favorable factors\nundergirding current housing activity, including the robust growth in\nemployment and incomes, high wealth-to-income ratios, and very\nattractive terms on home mortgages, seemed likely to continue to hold\nhousing construction close to current elevated levels.\n\nBased on very partial data, business inventory investment\nappeared to have moderated considerably in the second quarter from an\nunsustainable pace in the first quarter, and some further reductions\nin inventory accumulation could be expected over the balance of the\nyear. Several members commented, however, that despite the outsized\nrate of stockbuilding early in the year, there were no broad\nindications of an inventory overhang, whether from the standpoint of\ninventory-sales ratios or anecdotal expressions of concern. Against\nthis background, many of the members saw little reason to anticipate a\nfurther sizable drop in nonfarm inventory investment, though the\nperformance of this sector of the economy was always subject to a high\ndegree of uncertainty.\n\nWith regard to the external sector of the economy, the recent\ndeterioration of conditions in Japan and several emerging economies in\nAsia and the related effects on other countries around the world were\nadding significantly to the uncertainties facing the U.S. economy.\nMembers commented that it was too soon to judge the eventual extent\nand duration of the turmoil in Asia and its spillover to other\nnations, but several suggested that the consequences were likely to be\nmore severe and longer lasting than they had anticipated earlier.\nMoreover, there seemed to be a very small but growing possibility of\nmarked and spreading weakness that might have a more major effect on\nU.S. financial markets and the U.S. economy. One key to an improvement\nin the outlook for Asia was the adoption of appropriate policies\nby Japan, but very difficult political as well as economic problems\nclearly were involved for that nation and their resolution might well\nrequire an extended period of internal deliberations. From the standpoint\nof the United States, the Asian crisis and its repercussions\naround the world obviously were deepening the nation's trade deficit,\nbut other effects such as those on U.S. interest rates and prices in\nworld commodity markets, notably oil, were boosting domestic demand\nand tended to have a moderating near-term influence on inflation.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for prices and wages, members\nobserved that some key measures of price inflation had displayed a\nmodest uptilt recently. Though overall price inflation had remained\nsubdued when viewed over a longer horizon, signs of a continuing\nacceleration, should they become evident, would be a matter of\ngrowing concern. Reflecting very tight labor markets, the rate of\nincrease in labor compensation had been on an uptrend, but the rise in\nunit labor costs and overall unit product costs had been held down to\na very modest pace by gains in productivity. At some point, however,\nthe advance in labor compensation would exceed likely improvements in\nproductivity by an increasing margin unless the expansion in overall\ndemand, and hence in labor demand, moderated significantly. Members\ncited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened\nworker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in\npart by ample job opportunities. Any tendency for faster increases in\nlabor costs to feed through to price inflation was likely to be\nreinforced for a time by the unwinding of a number of special factors\nthat had tended to hold inflation down, including the decline in\nenergy prices in recent quarters and the dollar's appreciation during\n1997. Moreover, a rise in inflation would tend to erode currently\nfavorable inflation expectations and lead workers to demand higher\nnominal compensation. Nonetheless, questions could be raised about\nhow rapidly and to what extent the effects of tight labor markets\nwould show through to higher labor compensation and overall producer\ncosts and in turn how quickly the latter would induce significantly\nfaster increases in prices. Very competitive domestic and\ninternational markets for a wide range of products along with reduced\nprices of oil, other commodities, and imports more generally could\nwell keep inflation in check for some time. It was noted in this\nregard that members had tended in recent years to anticipate greater\ninflation than had materialized.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in February for 1998 and also\ndecided on tentative ranges for those aggregates in 1999. The current\nranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth\nquarter of 1998 were unchanged from the ranges for other recent years\nand included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for\nM3. An unchanged range of 3 to 7 percent also was set in February for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1998.\n\nAll the members favored or could support the retention of\nthe current ranges for this year and their extension on a provisional\nbasis to 1999. They took note of a staff projection that indicated\nthat, given the Committee's expectations for the performance of the\neconomy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates,\ngrowth of M2 and M3 probably would exceed the current ranges in 1998\nand decline to a little below the upper end of those ranges in 1999.\nBoth M2 and M3 had grown unusually quickly relative to spending in the\nfirst half of the year. The staff analysis suggested that some of the\nforces that might have been responsible for this decline in velocity\nwould abate, and the projections anticipated that the velocity of M2\nwould be roughly in line with historical experience prior to the early\n1990s, as it had been, on balance, for several years.\n\nIn their discussion of the choice of ranges for growth of M2\nand M3 in 1998 and 1999, the members agreed that those ranges should\nnot reflect forecasts of money growth under anticipated economic and\nfinancial conditions, but instead should be viewed as anchors or\nbenchmarks for money growth that would be associated with price\nstability and sustained economic growth, assuming behavior of velocity\nin line with historical experience. Reaffirming the current ranges\nfor 1998 and extending them to 1999 would thus underscore the\nCommittee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over\ntime. In the view of a few members, the Committee should consider\nadopting ranges centered on its expectations for growth of the\nmonetary aggregates in the future, but only if the members became more\nconfident about the relationship between the growth of money and\nmeasures of aggregate economic performance and undertook to give more\nweight to the growth of the broad monetary aggregates in setting\nmonetary policy. Some members noted that retention of the current\nmonetary ranges oriented toward price stability did not preclude\ngreater use of the aggregates in assessing overall financial\nconditions and the formulation of monetary policy. The Committee\nagreed that the current range for nonfinancial debt for 1998 should be\nleft unchanged and that the same range should be extended to 1999.\nThe current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to\nbe associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and\nprices.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to\nreaffirm the ranges for growth of M2, M3, and total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt that it had established in February for 1998 and to extend\nthose ranges on a tentative basis to 1999. In keeping with its usual\nprocedure under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review\nits preliminary ranges for 1999 early next year. Accordingly, the\nCommittee voted to incorporate the following statement regarding the\n1998 and 1999 ranges in its domestic policy directive:\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one of the members indicated that they could\nsupport an unchanged policy stance and retention of the current tilt\ntoward possible tightening in the directive. Although recent developments\nhad increased both the upside and the downside uncertainties in\nthe economic outlook, most of the members felt that the risks\ncontinued to point on balance toward rising inflation. While the\navailable evidence suggested that the economic expansion had in fact\nslowed considerably in the second quarter, largely because of reduced\ninventory accumulation against the backdrop of weakness in the foreign\ntrade sector, the retarding effects of those factors were seen as\nlikely to wane over coming quarters and there were only limited\nindications of any softening in domestic final demand. Moreover, the\npersistence of accommodative financial conditions, as evidenced by the\nample availability of financing on favorable terms to business and\nhousehold borrowers and by robust monetary growth, might well continue\nto support relatively strong domestic spending. As a consequence,\nmany of the members expressed concern that the expansion in demand\nmight continue at a fast enough pace to raise pressures on wages and\nprices over time. Nonetheless, the substantial uncertainties relating\nto prospective developments argued, as they had at recent meetings, in\nfavor of a cautious \"wait and see\" policy stance.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Jordan,\nKelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and\nMs. Rivlin. Votes against this action: None.\n\nAnother important reason for deferring any policy action was\nthat a tightening move would involve the risk of outsized reactions\nand consequent destabilizing effects on financial markets in the\ngrowing number of countries abroad that were experiencing severe\nfinancial difficulties. It was not possible to anticipate precisely\nwhat those effects might be, but the risks seemed to be particularly\nhigh at this time. To be sure, U.S. monetary policy had to be set\nultimately on the basis of the needs of the U.S. economy, but\nrecognition had to be given to the feedback of developments abroad on\nthe domestic economy. Those repercussions could be quite severe in\nthe event of further sizable economic and financial disturbances in\nsome of the nation's important trading partners. Many members\nconcluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten\ncurrent policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that\ninflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be\ngiven to potential reactions abroad. A number of these members\nemphasized, however, that they continued to see a high probability\nthat some tightening of monetary policy would be needed later to curb\nrising inflationary pressures. Accordingly, they believed that the\nCommittee should take advantage of any early opportunity to tighten\npolicy in order to improve the prospects of containing inflation and\nprolonging the economic expansion. One member was persuaded, however,\nthat such a policy move should be implemented at this meeting in order\nto avert the need for a stronger and probably more disruptive policy\nadjustment that would be needed later to head off rising inflation.\n\nGiven that the balance of risks was seen as pointing to\nrising inflation over time, the members agreed that it was desirable\nto retain the tilt toward restraint in the directive. Such a tilt\nwould continue to underscore the Committee's commitment to its long-run\nobjective of price stability and its view of the likely direction\nof the next policy move.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members accepted a directive that called for maintaining\nconditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged\nfederal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias\ntoward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal\nfunds rate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal\nfunds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate\nmight be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent\nwith moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the unsustainably\nrapid growth of domestic demand--fueled by the acceleration\nof money and credit growth in the past year--was reflected in the\nrecent sharp increase in imports and rising trade deficits. As U.S.\noutput growth slows significantly from the rapid pace of 1997 and\nearly 1998, it will be essential that domestic demand also slow. The\nvery welcome progress toward eliminating inflation in recent years has\ncontributed to the outstanding performance of the economy. Allowing\ndomestic demand to continue to exceed domestic production would run\nthe risk that corrosive effects of rising inflation would undermine\nfuture growth prospects. Furthermore, the resultant trade and current\naccount deficits would have to be matched by ever larger inflows of\nforeign capital. Modest monetary restraint at this time might prevent\neither the buildup of inflationary imbalances that would eventually\nnecessitate future policy restraint or unsustainable capital flows.\nIn either case an economic contraction might become unavoidable.\n\nMost short-term interest rates have changed little\nsince the meeting on May 19, but longer-term rates have\ndeclined somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets\nremained volatile and changes in major indexes were mixed\non balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar\nrose sharply through mid-June in terms of other major\ncurrencies, declined more recently, but is up somewhat\non net since the May meeting; the fluctuations in the\naverage value of the dollar in terms of these major\ncurrencies were largely related to movements against the\nJapanese yen. The dollar has risen further against the\ncurrencies of key emerging market economies, particularly\nsome of those in Asia.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter,\nbut remained fairly robust. For the year through June,\nboth aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's\nranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat\nafter a pickup earlier in the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this\nmeeting the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1998. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1999, the Committee agreed on\ntentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999, of\n1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The\nCommittee provisionally set the associated range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7\npercent for 1999. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of\nprogress toward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\nto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley,\nMeyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin. Votes against this action: Mr. Jordan.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:40 p.m.\n\nAttended portion of the meeting relating to the discussion of the\nCommittee's consideration of its monetary and debt ranges for 1998\nand 1999.\n\nAttended portions of the meeting relating to the Committee's\nreview of the economic outlook and consideration of its monetary\nand debt ranges for 1998 and 1999."
