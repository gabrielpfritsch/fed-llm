All operations undertaken pursuant to\nsuch clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on\nany day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the\nCommittee.\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the\nSystem's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150\nmillion, or $300 million when the operation is associated with\nrepayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of\ntrading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change\nin the System's net position in that currency might be less than the\nlimits specified in 1.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the\nSubcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the\nfull Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion\nsince the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the\nChairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any\noperations that are not of a routine character.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets and on System open market\ntransactions in foreign currencies during the period February 1, 1995,\nthrough March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period February\n1, 1995, through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\nand financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over\nthe intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and\nfinancial information available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early\n1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a\nsharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in\nhousing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of\nsome weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had\nbeen recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and\noverall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of\nconsumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over\nJanuary and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over\nJanuary and February, although the average monthly advance was\nsomewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were\nrecorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in\nretail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed\na bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The\naverage workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a\nhigh level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose\nin January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4\npercent.\n\nThe expansion in industrial production also moderated in\nJanuary and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing\nproduction grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in\nFebruary for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining\nproduction continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of\nutilities surged during the January-February period as winter\ntemperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal,\nCapacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first\ntwo months of the year, remained high.\n\nRetail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable\nrise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with\nslippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of\nhousing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to\nthe earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell\nsharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines\nmore than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the\nclosing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes\nin January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for\nsome months.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another\nstrong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing\nequipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January,\nand demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business\noutlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge\nin January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders\ndata of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion\nin business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction\nactivity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years;\nhowever, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and\nJanuary, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending\nderegulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance\nfor nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in\nthe uptrend.\n\nBusiness inventory investment surged in January after a\nslowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor\nvehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in\nJanuary at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994.\nIn manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January;\nthe stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical\nlows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up\nin January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset\na reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales\nratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within\nits range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories\njumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the\nrise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January\nand remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at\nautomotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply\nwhile elsewhere the ratio edged lower.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened sharply in January from its December level and its average\nrate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was\ndue to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment\nfactors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods\nand services declined substantially in January after having increased\nstrongly in November and December. The value of imports rose\nconsiderably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter.\nThe export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely\nacross major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the\nmajor foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in\nrecent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in\nJapan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial\ncountries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested\nthat in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the\nmajor foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared\nto be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.\n\nConsumer price increases in January and February were a\nlittle larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were\nunchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices\nwere up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in\nJanuary and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer\nprice inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with\na steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup.\nProducer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two\nmonths of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second\nhalf of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or\nnonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial\nrise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings\nincreased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994.\n\nAt its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee\nadopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible\nrise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive\napproved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or\nsomewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nOn the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors\napproved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount\nrate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and\nwas passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open\nmarket operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a\nview to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting\nand implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate\naveraged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval,\nand adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated\nlevels.\n\nFinancial market participants generally had expected a\nfirming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest\nrates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market\ninterest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data\nthat were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of\neconomic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that\nwere viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy\ntightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields\nwere concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations.\nStronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened\nprospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low\ninflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially\nfurther. The dollar's decline was particularly sharp against the\nJapanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows\nagainst these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest\nrates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and\nfiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar's drop.\nContinuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted\nin further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the\ndollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar\nbecause the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower\nvalue of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and\nincreased exports to the United States.\n\nM2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after\nsizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to\nsome recovery in both aggregates. M2's weakness in February partly\nreflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its\nvolatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase\nagreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to\nbe associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by\nshifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3\nin February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2\ncomponent increased substantially further as banks continued to rely\nheavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent\nmonths.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead\nwould average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy's\npotential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened\nsomewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however,\nthe recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock\nprices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate\ndemand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of\nthe dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting\nto offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of\nreserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the\nperiod ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in\nreal incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been\nsatisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest\nrates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new\nequipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth\nof sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat\nfurther in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for\na time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of\nslower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage\nrates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a\nstrong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the\neconomies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty\ncontinued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the\nprevious forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed\nover the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy was\noperating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there\nremained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion\ndid not moderate sufficiently.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the\neconomic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown\nwas not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented\nsince early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive\nsectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some\ncutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of\nprevious quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in\na period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to\nretain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances\nseemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being\ncorrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates,\nif these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive\nspending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat\nwith respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the\nprognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy\nappeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for\neconomic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern\nthat the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting\npressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher\ninflation.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, members\nreported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite\nstrong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a\nnumber of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business\nsentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat\nless ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys\nsuggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though\ndown slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the\nfavorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending\npolicies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth\nhad slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.\n\nIn their review of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending\nthat had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a\nconsiderable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in\nspending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most\nrecent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable\ngoods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable\ngoods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening\nover the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might\nhave led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary\npurchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was\ndifficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a\nmore prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in\nconsumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more\nin line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending\nwould tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of\nconsumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had\nstrengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to\nbolster consumer confidence.\n\nThe housing market had weakened noticeably according to\nincoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The\ndecline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had\npersisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of\nthe year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory\nof unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had\nprevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing\ndemand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some\nreports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a\nmitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in\nhousing construction was being countered by further improvement in\nnonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial\nreal estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed\nto be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity.\n\nCommittee members anticipated that growth of business\ninvestment in plant and equipment would moderate from the\nextraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment\nwould continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the\nforecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to\nincrease more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and\nbusiness profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on\nequipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with\nthat expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that\ninvestment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in\nan environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity\nutilization, intense desires to control costs and improve\ncompetitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The\ndesire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending\nfor the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which\nremained on an uptrend.\n\nThe rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters\nhad been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales,\nbut with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and\neconomic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory\ninvestment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing\nand extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term\ninventory correction process might already be under way, with firms\ninitiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that\ninventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and\nthey anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be\nmade quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory\ncorrection and its effect on economic activity would be limited.\nMoreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested\nthat many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect\nagainst shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.\n\nThe defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had\nclouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately\nrestrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward\na balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable\nassumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more\nrestrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current\npolitical debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget\nmight be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial\nmarkets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.\n\nMembers commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded\nthe outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable\nto forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution,\non balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast\nperiod. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were\nleading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports\nsuggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity\ntended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico.\nHowever, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico,\nand more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the\nmajor trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the\ndollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the\nnation's trade balance.\n\nMembers noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently\nhad slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other\nproducer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many\nmaterials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus\nfar there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise,\nthe persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point\nfostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant\nrise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some\nmeasure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of\nheavy business investments in new capacity and more productive\nequipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business\norganization that were raising the economy's capacity for sustained,\nnoninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that\ndespite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in\nmaterials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in\npassing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the\ndollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In\nthese circumstances, the members generally concluded that some\nincrease in inflation was likely in coming months.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the\nintermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to\nmaintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The\npolicy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared\nto be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic\nactivity and associated demands for goods and services. But the\nextent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary\npressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available\nevidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a\ngrowth path for economic activity that would be consistent with\nlimiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced.\nIn discussing their policy choices, several members noted the\nrelatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they\nbelieved that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of\na specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation\nof an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of\nall the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current\ncircumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were\ninvolved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and\nassess developments before taking any further policy action.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an\nasymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated\nthat near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment\nto policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected\nto be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise\nin inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet\ninflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be\nmore consistent with the Committee's objective of moving over time\ntoward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward\nmomentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown\nin growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary\ntightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this\nconnection a few members indicated that further tightening might well\nbe needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also\nwould provide a clear signal of the Committee's intention to resist\nhigher inflation.\n\nA few members preferred a symmetric directive. These\nmembers agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if\ninflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker\neconomic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view\nthis balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a\nsymmetric directive. The Committee's determination to keep inflation\nunder control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through\nfuture actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward\nrestraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an\nasymmetric intermeeting instruction.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they preferred or could support a directive\nthat called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of\nreserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the expansion of economic activity has moderated\nconsiderably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment\nrose appreciably further in January and February, but\nat a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the\ncivilian unemployment rate, after rising in January,\nfell back in February to its December level of 5.4\npercent. Advances in industrial production also\nmoderated in January and February, and capacity\nutilization rates generally changed little from already\nhigh levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged\nover the two months. Housing starts have declined\nsomewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during\nthe closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense\ncapital goods point to a still strong expansion of\nspending on business equipment, but with tentative\nsigns of some deceleration; nonresidential construction\nhas been trending appreciably higher. The nominal\ndeficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened\nsharply in January from its average rate in the fourth\nquarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices\nincreased faster on average over January and February.\n\nOn February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors\napproved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the\ndiscount rate, and in keeping with the Committee's\ndecision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the\nincrease was allowed to show through fully to interest\nrates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market\ninterest rates have declined somewhat since the\nCommittee meeting; the largest declines have been\nconcentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies was down substantially further over the\nintermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to\ndepreciate against the dollar.\n\nM2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for\nthe first part of March pointed to some rebound.\nGrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked\nup a little in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4\npercent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee\nanticipated that money growth within these ranges would\nbe consistent with its broad policy objectives. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will\ncontinue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, May 23, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
