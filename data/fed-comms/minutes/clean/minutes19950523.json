The\nCommittee also liberalized its rule relating to attendance at FOMC\nmeetings to allow First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks\nto attend meetings on a rotating basis. Other changes of a technical\nor updating nature also were made to the Program. The Committee's\nbrief discussion of this organizational matter was not recorded in\nkeeping with the decision made at the meeting on January 31 February\n1, 1995 normally not to record discussions unrelated to\nmonetary policy.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on March 28, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign\ncurrency transactions during the period March 28, 1995 through May 22,\n1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period March 28,\n1995, through May 22, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe Manager requested a temporary increase of $2 billion, to\n$10 billion, in the limit on intermeeting changes in outright System\nAccount holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. He\nadvised the Committee that the current leeway of $8 billion might not\nbe sufficient to accommodate the potentially large need for additional\nreserves over the intermeeting period to meet an anticipated seasonal\nrise in the domestic demand for currency as well as continued currency\noutflows to foreign countries. By unanimous vote, the Committee\namended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market\nOperations to raise the limit to $10 billion for the intermeeting\nperiod ending with the close of business on July 5, 1995.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion of economic activity had slowed considerably further and\nthat rates of resource utilization had declined. Although business\ninvestment in equipment and structures had remained strong, overall\nfinal sales had expanded less rapidly and inventories had continued to\nbuild. Manufacturing output appeared to be down appreciably, in large\nmeasure reflecting cutbacks in motor vehicle production, and the slump\nin housing starts since the turn of the year was depressing\nconstruction activity. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices\nhad increased a little faster thus far this year, while advances in\nlabor compensation costs had remained subdued.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment posted reduced gains in the first\nquarter and changed little in April; special factors and seasonal\nadjustment difficulties may have depressed reported job growth in\nApril. Hiring in service-producing industries was down sharply from\nthe pace in previous months, with jobs in personnel supply services\nfalling for a second consecutive month after three years of rapid\ngrowth. Employment in manufacturing decreased further, and the number\nof construction jobs contracted after a sizable weather-related surge\nin March. Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased\nconsiderably in recent weeks, and the civilian unemployment rate rose\nto 5.8 percent in April.\n\nIndustrial production fell further in April, with\nmanufacturing registering a substantial decline. The drop in\nindustrial output largely reflected a cutback in the production of\nmotor vehicles and parts, but declines in output also were evident in\nother cyclically sensitive sectors, such as non-auto consumer durables\nand construction supplies. Production of business equipment other\nthan motor vehicles registered a small gain. Total utilization of\nindustrial capacity continued to decline in April; however, operating\nrates in manufacturing remained at relatively high levels.\n\nRetail sales were down in April after having risen moderately\nover the first quarter; a steep drop in sales of motor vehicles\naccounted for all of the April decline. Total expenditures on other\ntypes of goods edged higher in April, even though sales of apparel,\nfurniture, and home appliances were noticeably weaker. Housing starts\nchanged little in April after having declined sharply in the first\nquarter, and the inventory of new homes for sale remained relatively\nlarge. On the other hand, sales of both new and existing homes rose\nmoderately in March after sizable declines in February, and recent\nsurveys indicated some improvement in attitudes toward homebuying.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods remained on a strong\nuptrend in March, with outlays for office and computing equipment\nregistering another sharp increase. Manufacturers of heavy trucks\ncontinued to operate at capacity to meet demand; by contrast, business\nexpenditures for motor vehicles reportedly plunged in April. Data on\norders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further strong\nexpansion of spending on business equipment in the months ahead,\nalthough gains appeared likely to be smaller than those of the past\nseveral quarters. Nonresidential construction continued to rise in\nMarch, and data on permits for new construction suggested that\nbuilding activity would advance further in coming months, though\nperhaps at a somewhat slower rate.\n\nBusiness inventories surged again in March, and the pace of\ninventory accumulation over the first quarter was substantially higher\nthan the average rate for the second half of 1994. Much of the first-quarter increase in stocks reflected a buildup in inventories of motor\nvehicles at the wholesale and retail levels. Non-auto stocks also\nincreased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, accompanied by the\nemergence of scattered signs of inventory imbalances in furniture,\nappliances, and apparel at the retail level and in construction\nsupplies at earlier stages of production and distribution. The stock-to-sales ratio in manufacturing was unchanged in March from the very\nlow fourth-quarter level. At the wholesale level, the ratio of\ninventories to sales rose in March but remained within the range of\nthe last several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector\nslowed in March despite a further rise in inventories of motor\nvehicles. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales\nratio increased in March to the top end of its range of the last two\nyears; when the motor vehicle components of stocks and sales are\nexcluded, however, the ratio was near the middle of its range in\nrecent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was\nlittle changed in March from the February level and remained\nsubstantially narrower than in January. On a quarterly average basis,\nthe trade deficit widened in the first quarter as growth in the value\nof exports slowed while the expansion in the value of imports\ncontinued unabated. A drop in shipments to Mexico was among the\nfactors holding down export growth in March. Data available for the\nfirst quarter indicated that economic recovery continued in the major\nforeign industrial countries as a group but that the pace varied\nsignificantly across countries. There were signs of sustained growth\nin the United Kingdom, slower growth in Canada, renewed recovery in\nJapan, and weakness in France and Italy.\n\nInflation had picked up somewhat in the early months of 1995.\nAt the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first\nquarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. In\nApril, a surge in food prices and a rebound in energy prices\ncontributed to a further step-up in consumer inflation. At the\nproducer level, prices of finished goods followed a roughly similar\npattern, increasing at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter and\nthen more briskly in April. The April rise partly reflected a sharp\njump in the prices of finished energy goods, but prices of non-energy,\nnonfood items also advanced at a somewhat faster rate. At earlier\nstages of production, prices of intermediate materials continued to\nincrease rapidly in April. By contrast, trends in labor compensation\ncosts remained subdued. Gains in hourly compensation of private\nindustry workers slowed further in the first quarter of 1995, with a\ncontinuing moderation in the cost of benefits accounting for all of\nthe deceleration in compensation.\n\nAt its meeting on March 28, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates\nover coming months.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the\nperiod, reflecting a rising need for seasonal credit at the beginning\nof the planting season, while the federal funds rate continued to\naverage close to 6 percent.\n\nMost market interest rates moved lower over the intermeeting\nperiod in reaction to weaker-than-expected incoming economic data,\nwhich market participants interpreted as signaling a considerable\nslowing of the economic expansion and a growing likelihood that the\nnext monetary policy move would be in an easing direction. Market\nassessments that the prospects for major reductions in budget deficits\nwere improving also seemed to contribute to the drop in rates. In\nthis environment, the release of data indicating large increases in\nconsumer and producer prices for April only temporarily interrupted\nthe decline in rates. Intermediate- and long-term interest rates\nposted the largest declines over the intermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially\nfurther over the first half of the intermeeting period. In mid-April,\nthe dollar reached a record low against the Japanese yen and\napproached a record low against the German mark. The dollar's\nweakness appeared to have been related in part to further indications\nof softening economic activity and related declines in interest rates\nin the United States and to increasing trade tensions with Japan.\nLate in the period, the dollar reversed its course and moved up\nsharply against the yen and the mark; monetary easing abroad,\nimproving prospects for reductions in the U.S. budget deficit, and\nstabilizing financial conditions in Mexico appeared to contribute to\nthe turnaround. The dollar ended the intermeeting period higher on\nbalance against the other G-10 currencies.\n\nThe growth of M2 picked up further in April, reflecting in\npart the need for additional liquid balances to make unusually heavy\nfinal tax payments; these payments resulted from the stronger economy\nin 1994 and from new tax regulations allowing individuals to delay a\nlarger portion of their tax payments until April. The expansion of M2\nalso appeared to be boosted by the increased relative attractiveness\nof small time deposits and money market funds following declines in\nmarket interest rates. For the year through April, M2 grew at a rate\nin the lower half of its range for 1995 while M3 expanded at a rate\nsomewhat above its range. The persisting strength of M3 in April\nlargely reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund continuing\nheavy credit demands by households and businesses. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt had grown at a rate a little above the midpoint of\nits monitoring range in recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth of economic activity was slowing somewhat more than previously\nanticipated, with the recent plunge in motor vehicle sales prompting a\ndeeper-than-expected reduction in the production of cars and light\ntrucks. Economic expansion would average less than the rate of\nincrease in the economy's potential output for a number of months, but\nthe favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally\nthat had occurred in stock and bond markets were expected to provide\nunderlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996.\nThe forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be\nrestrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of\npent-up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Business\noutlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in\nresponse to the slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was\nprojected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline\nin mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico might depress U.S. exports\nfurther, but mainly in the very near term given the size of the\nadjustments already evident in the Mexican current account. With this\ninfluence waning, sustained growth in the economies of other U.S.\ntrading partners was expected to boost export demand. Considerable\nuncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but the forecast\nmaintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been\nassumed since early in the year. In the staff's judgment, the\nprospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that\nprice inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members reported on statistical and anecdotal\nindications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity\nand some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer\nresources. A number commented that they anticipated a relatively\nsluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut\nback to bring inventories into better balance with sales. However,\nunderlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust, especially\nin light of developments in financial markets, to avert a cumulative\ndecline in business activity and, indeed, to return economic growth to\na pace broadly in line with potential. Members cited in particular\nthe strength in business fixed investment and the potential for\nimprovement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that\nshould help to sustain the expansion. Nonetheless, the longer-run\noutlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given\nthe undecided course of fiscal policy and the ongoing inventory\ncorrection; the ultimate extent of that correction and its effects on\noverall economic performance were subject to a cyclical dynamic whose\noutcome could not be predicted with confidence. A worsening in key\nmeasures of inflation, including the consumer price index and the\nproducer price index for finished goods, was a disappointing--if not\nunexpected--development. A number of members expressed concern that\nthe risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up\nin inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that\ninflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate\ngrowth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and\nrelatively subdued increases in labor costs.\n\nMembers commented that a reduction in the rate of inventory\ninvestment was likely to be the dominant influence on the near-term\nperformance of the economy. Some also saw a risk that a significantly\ngreater-than-expected softening in inventory accumulation might have\nadverse, and possibly cumulative, effects of a longer-term nature on\nproduction and incomes and thus on consumer and business spending.\nWith the exception of the motor vehicle industry, however, current\ninventory levels generally were quite low in relation to sales and\npotential inventory adjustments were likely to be limited in size.\nOnce further inventory adjustments were completed, the rate of\naccumulation could be expected to remain well below the unsustainable\npace experienced over the past year and perhaps settle into a pattern\nwhere changes in inventories became a relatively neutral factor in the\nongoing economic expansion.\n\nIn their comments about broad factors underlying the economic\noutlook, members reported that current business and consumer sentiment\nremained generally favorable across the nation. Despite the softening\ndemand in some markets or industries, notably that for motor vehicles,\nbusiness contacts continued to express optimism about the outlook for\ntheir firms, though some of their comments were tempered by greater\ncaution than had been observed earlier. A number of members referred\nto the general financial climate as an important element in the\noutlook for sustained economic expansion. They noted that the decline\nin interest rates had favorable implications for demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The rise in equity prices also was\ncontributing to reductions in the cost of capital to businesses, and\nbanks continued to ease terms and standards on loans. In addition,\nthe rise in stock and bond prices had increased the net worth of many\nhouseholds, though some concern was expressed about the sustainability\nof the stock market's strong performance.\n\nWith regard to developments in key sectors of the economy,\nthe slowdown in the growth of consumer spending was somewhat more\npronounced than anticipated earlier. Some rebound in consumer demand\nseemed likely and already appeared to be occurring in the motor\nvehicle industry in May. Underlying conditions for further growth in\nconsumer spending were viewed as relatively favorable; these\nconditions included strengthened balance sheets stemming from\ndevelopments in financial markets, continued growth of incomes, and\naggressive extensions of consumer credit by a number of lenders. In\nat least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace\nthat could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could\ncoincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On\nbalance, growth in personal consumption expenditures was seen as\nlikely to continue over coming quarters but at a reduced pace given\nthe apparent satisfaction of a large portion of earlier pent-up\ndemands for consumer durables and some expected moderation in the\ngrowth of jobs and incomes.\n\nBusiness investment remained on a strong uptrend as numerous\nfirms continued to respond to the need to relieve pressures on\nexisting capacity and to increase operating efficiencies in the face\nof vigorous competition. Rapid growth in profits and a ready\navailability of financing also were cited as factors tending to\nsupport business investment spending. The increase in such spending\nwas likely to moderate over the projection horizon, though to a still\nbrisk pace, as declining growth in demand and easing pressures on\ncapacity induced growing caution in business investment decisions.\nIndeed, the growth in expenditures for producer durable equipment\nalready appeared to be moderating from an extremely rapid pace, though\nnonresidential construction was reported to be posting solid gains in\nseveral parts of the country.\n\nMembers also expected some strengthening in residential\nconstruction following the large declines in mortgage interest rates\nthat had occurred since late 1994. Housing construction had trended\nlower since the start of the year, but several indicators pointed to a\nrevival. The latter included surveys showing improving homebuyer\nattitudes and builder assessments of the outlook for new home sales,\nand rising applications to purchase homes. Sizable inventories of\nunsold new homes would probably continue to damp construction activity\nfor some months, but contacts in the real estate and mortgage finance\nindustries were more optimistic about the outlook for housing.\n\nThe foreign trade sector likewise was expected to make an\nappreciable contribution to the expansion of economic activity in\ncoming quarters. The robust uptrend in U.S. exports during 1994 had\nbeen slowed to a considerable extent thus far this year by the sharp\nadjustment in trade with Mexico, but in the view of several members\nthat adjustment might now be largely completed. In that event, gains\nin exports could be expected to resume at a fairly brisk pace despite\nindications of reduced economic growth in some key foreign countries.\nThis assessment was supported by anecdotal reports of rising foreign\ndemand for some U.S. products in the context of the generally improved\ninternational competitive position of the United States.\nConcurrently, growth in imports would tend to be held down by the\nprojected slowing in the expansion of domestic demand. On the\nnegative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer\nperiod might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced\nby Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the\npotential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current\nnegotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded.\n\nFiscal policy was seen as a major uncertainty in the economic\noutlook. Federal purchases of goods and services were expected to\ncontinue trending lower and the growth of transfer payments was likely\nto be trimmed, but the extent and timing of fiscal restraint could not\nbe determined while federal deficit reduction continued to be debated\nin the Congress. In the view of at least some members, however, a\nlarger fiscal contraction than was commonly expected might well\nmaterialize, perhaps starting later this year. The course of fiscal\nlegislation undoubtedly would continue to affect financial markets\nand, in the opinion of some members, would need to be taken into\naccount in the formulation of monetary policy.\n\nConcerning inflation, several members commented that the rise\nin consumer prices and some other broad measures of inflation in\nrecent months appeared to reflect cyclical developments relating to\nthe tightening of resource and product markets over the past year,\nincluding the partial pass-through of sizable increases in prices at\nearlier stages of production. In addition, higher import prices\nmight have been playing a role. A number of members expressed concern\nthat, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its\nsustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if\nthe current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of\nabove-average growth. On the other hand, members who saw the odds as\npointing to a more moderate rebound after a period of relatively\nsluggish economic performance were inclined to the view that an upward\ntrend in inflation was likely to be averted. In addition, the ongoing\ncompetitive pressures in many markets, the restraint in compensation\nincreases, and the continuing efforts to cut production costs would\nhelp to contain pressures on prices over time.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain the\ncurrent stance of policy. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly\nhad damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term\nmarket rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending\nterms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the\ncurrencies of many major industrial countries. On balance, it\nappeared that the current configuration of financial market conditions\nand degree of monetary restraint was likely to be consistent with\nmoderate expansion in nominal GDP and prices following a period of\nsome weakness in the economy as inventory imbalances were corrected.\nThe risks of a different outcome, in either direction, seemed to be\nreasonably balanced. In the circumstances, because the dimensions of\nthe near-term deceleration and the potential strength of underlying\ndemand remained uncertain, the members concluded that it was desirable\nto monitor developments carefully and wait for additional information\nbefore deciding on the next policy move.\n\nWith regard to the possible need to adjust policy during the\nintermeeting period, all the members were in favor of shifting\nto an unbiased instruction that did not incorporate any presumption\nwith regard to the direction of potential intermeeting changes. The\nmembers agreed that no compelling case could be made at this point for\npotential adjustments to policy in either direction during the period\nahead, and retaining a bias in the directive would give a misleading\nindication of the Committee's current intentions for the period. One\nmember expressed the view that the costs of being wrong currently\nseemed higher in the direction of accommodating too much inflation,\nthough signs of a possible cumulative deterioration in economic\nactivity could not be ignored should they materialize. Another\nmember, who saw the longer-term risks to the economy as tilted to the\ndownside of current projections, indicated that while the recent\nperformance of the economy might argue for some easing of monetary\npolicy, a steady policy course without any bias in the intermeeting\ninstruction was appropriate for now in light of the generally\naccomodative financial and banking markets.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a\npresumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the expansion of economic activity has slowed\nconsiderably further. In April, nonfarm payroll\nemployment was about unchanged after posting reduced\ngains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production\nfell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the\nproduction of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization\nrates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker\ndemand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down\nin April after rising moderately over the first\nquarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after\ndeclining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for\nnondefense capital goods point to further strong\nexpansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend\nappreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade\nin goods and services widened in the first quarter from\nits average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes\nof consumer and producer prices have increased faster\non average thus far this year, while advances in labor\ncompensation costs have remained subdued.\n\nIntermediate- and long-term interest rates have\ndeclined considerably further since the Committee\nmeeting on March 28, while short-term rates have\nregistered small decreases. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in\nterms of the other G-10 currencies, after falling to\nlow levels, rose on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nM2 and M3 strengthened in March and April. For\nthe year through April, M2 expanded at a rate in the\nlower half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate\nsomewhat above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt has grown at a rate a bit above the midpoint of\nits monitoring range in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4\npercent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee\nanticipated that money growth within these ranges would\nbe consistent with its broad policy objectives. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will\ncontinue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action : None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Wednesday-Thursday, July 5-6, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:15 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
