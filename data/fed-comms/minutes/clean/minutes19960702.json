Kos and Meyer, Vice Presidents, Federal\nReserve Banks of New York and Philadelphia\nrespectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open\nmarket transactions in foreign currencies for System account during\nthe period since the meeting on May 21, 1996, and thus no vote was\nrequired of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in U.S.\n\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nMay 21, 1996, through July 2, 1996. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1996\nand 1997, and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity advanced considerably further in the second quarter,\nalthough growth in aggregate final demand showed some signs of\nslowing. Consumer spending continued to post sizable gains, but\nbusiness investment in equipment and structures apparently was rising\nless vigorously, and higher mortgage rates evidently were starting to\nexert some restraint on housing construction activity. Business\ninventories had been brought into better balance with sales, and\nproduction and employment had risen appreciably. Upward pressures on\nfood and energy prices had led to somewhat larger increases in the\nconsumer price index over recent months.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to expand briskly over\nApril and May. Job gains were concentrated in the service-producing\nand construction industries, while employment in manufacturing was\nstable on balance over the April-May period after having declined\nsomewhat in 1995 and the first quarter of 1996. The civilian\nunemployment rate rose in May to 5.6 percent, which was the average\nrate for the year to date.\n\nIndustrial production increased appreciably further in May.\nIn contrast to April's advance, much of which had resulted from the\nresumption of operations at a major motor vehicle manufacturer after\nthe settlement of a strike, the May rise largely reflected gains in a\nwide range of non-auto-related manufacturing industries as well as a\nweather-related jump in electricity generation. The surge in overall\noutput lifted total utilization of industrial capacity somewhat above\nthe average rate recorded during the previous two quarters.\n\nTotal nominal retail sales surged in May after having changed\nlittle in April; the increase in sales, coupled with available\ninformation on prices, suggested that real consumer spending on goods\nhad risen substantially on balance since the first quarter. Recent\ndata (available through April) indicated that spending on services had\nincreased moderately on balance in recent months. Single-family\nhousing starts fell considerably in May from the relatively high April\nlevel. The decline suggested that the rise in mortgage rates in\nrecent months had begun to damp construction activity, but indicators\nof housing demand, such as sales of new and existing homes, remained\nrelatively robust.\n\nGrowth in business expenditures on durable equipment and\nnonresidential structures appeared to be slowing following a surge in\noutlays in the first quarter. In May, shipments of nondefense capital\ngoods rebounded from the substantial decline in April; however,\nexcluding movements in the volatile aircraft category, shipments were\ndown on balance over the two months. Among the major components,\nshipments of both computing and communications equipment fell sharply\nin April and retraced only part of that decline in May. Recent data\non new orders pointed to more modest increases in spending on business\nequipment over the months ahead. Nonresidential building activity\nincreased considerably further in April (latest data available), but\nincoming information on contracts suggested that growth in\nnonresidential construction would weaken somewhat in coming months.\n\nBusinesses had made considerable progress in recent months in\nbringing their inventories into better alignment with sales. In\nmanufacturing, stocks rose moderately in April after a decline in\nMarch. The stock-to-shipments ratio dropped further in April and was\nat a low level. At the wholesale trade level, inventory accumulation\nwas appreciable in April after several months of modest growth. The\ninventory-to-sales ratio for this sector edged up in April but\nremained well below the elevated levels of last fall. Retail\ninventories increased slightly in April after a large decline in March\nassociated with a substantial liquidation of motor vehicle stocks.\nThe aggregate ratio of inventories to sales for retail establishments\nwas around the lower end of its range in recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened in April from its rate in the first quarter, reflecting a\nslightly larger increase in the value of imports than in that of\nexports. The expansion in imports was concentrated in oil as U.S.\nrefiners sought to meet growing domestic demand and rebuild their\ninventories. The rise in exports was broadly based, although exports\nof computers, semiconductors, and automotive products edged off.\nEconomic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared\nto have expanded moderately on balance since the beginning of the\nyear. In the first quarter, economic performance ranged from\nunexpectedly robust in Japan to further weakness in Germany; the\nlimited data available for the second quarter suggested a slowdown in\nJapan, a bounceback in Germany, and moderate growth in other major\ntrading partners.\n\nAt its meeting on May 21, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4\npercent, the level expected to be associated with the unchanged policy\nstance. Because the Committee's decision had been largely anticipated\nin financial markets, other market interest rates also were little\nchanged during the early part of the period. However, market rates\nincreased appreciably following the release of a strong employment\nreport in early June, though most of that rise was later retraced as\nexpectations of near-term tightening of monetary policy diminished.\nOn balance, most market rates were up a little over the intermeeting\nperiod. Major indexes of stock prices were down on balance over the\nperiod.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated slightly over\nthe intermeeting period. The dollar declined against the German mark\nand other European currencies as growing indications of a recent\npickup in economic activity in Germany damped market expectations of\nany further easing of monetary policy by the Bundesbank. By contrast,\nthe dollar rose against the yen in apparent response to a series of\nstatements by Japanese officials suggesting that there would be no\nnear-term firming of Japanese monetary policy.\n\nThe broad monetary aggregates were weak in May: M2 declined,\nand M3 expanded relatively sluggishly. The weakness in M2 and M3 was\nassociated in part with the adverse effects of the earlier rise in\nmarket interest rates on the opportunity costs of holding deposits.\nDeposit balances also may have been drawn down to meet unusually large\nindividual tax liabilities on the April 15 tax date. Partial data for\nJune pointed to a rebound in both aggregates. For the year through\nJune, these aggregates were estimated to have grown at rates around\nthe upper bounds of their respective annual ranges. Expansion of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt had slowed somewhat in recent months,\nbut the debt aggregate had remained in the middle portion of its\nannual range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that,\nafter a sizable advance in economic activity in the second quarter,\ngrowth would moderate and the economy would expand around or perhaps a\nlittle above its estimated potential. Consumer spending was projected\nto expand at a more moderate pace, in line with disposable income; the\nfavorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the\nstill-ample availability of credit were expected to balance persisting\nconsumer concerns about job and retirement security and the\nrestraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was\nforecast to slow somewhat in response to the back-up in residential\nmortgage rates but was expected to remain at a relatively high level\nin the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable\ncash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on\nequipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light\nof the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits and the\nreduced rate of utilization of production capacity now prevailing.\nThe external sector was expected to exert a small restraining\ninfluence on economic activity over the projection period, even though\nan anticipated firming of economic activity abroad would bolster\ndemand for U.S. exports. Little further fiscal contraction was\nforecast over the projection period. Inflation recently had been\nlifted by adverse developments in energy markets and was projected to\nremain above the levels of recent years, given the still-high level of\nresource utilization and the effects of tight grain supplies on food\nprices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on the stronger-than-expected\nexpansion in overall economic activity in recent months, but for a\nvariety of reasons they anticipated that growth would slow appreciably\nover the second half of the year to a pace more in line with the\ngrowth in the economy's potential. Key factors bearing on this\noutlook included the prospective effects of the rise in interest rates\nand the dollar that had occurred since earlier in the year and the\nwaning influence of transitory factors that had stimulated economic\nactivity in the second quarter. The members generally agreed,\nhowever, that, apart from evidence of some moderation in the growth of\nbusiness investment expenditures from a very rapid pace, there were\nfew hard indications of a slowing in the expansion and the risks were\nclearly to the upside of their current forecasts. Against that\nbackground, they were concerned that inflation could begin to rise.\nCost and price pressures had been surprisingly well contained at high\nlevels of resource utilization, but this unusually favorable\nperformance might not be sustained, and in any event even greater\nresource utilization, as would occur if growth did not moderate\nappreciably, carried substantial inflation risk. There were some\nscattered indications in statistical and anecdotal reports that tended\nto suggest that wage inflation might be trending higher, although key\nmeasures of price inflation, excluding their food and energy\ncomponents, continued to display a flat or even a declining trend.\n\nIn their assessment of factors bearing on the outlook for\nfinal demand, members commented that growth in consumer spending was\nlikely to moderate in coming quarters from its pace thus far this\nyear. This moderation would reflect the projected slowing in income\ngrowth. While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household\nnet worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi-\ntures, members also cited a number of limiting factors. The latter\nincluded the increase in consumer indebtedness, satisfaction of\nearlier pent-up demand for consumer durable goods, and continuing\nconcern about job security. Higher interest rates also were expected\nto exert an inhibiting effect on purchases of consumer durables,\nincluding those related to housing. Some members observed that while\nslower growth in consumer spending was the most probable forecast,\nthey saw an upside risk from the wealth effects of the large rise that\nhad occurred in the value of stock market holdings.\n\nBusiness expenditures for plant and equipment were expected\nto grow at a slower though still appreciable pace. Indeed, such\nspending already appeared to be moderating. Contract data suggested\nthat nonresidential construction activity was on a slowing growth\ntrajectory and expansion of outlays for producers' durable equipment\nalso appeared to have softened. Given the outlook for slower growth\nin final demand, many businesses would not have to add significantly\nto capacity. However, spending for computing equipment, while perhaps\nmoderating from the exceptional pace of recent quarters, was thought\nlikely to remain buoyant as continuing innovations and declining\nprices stimulated further solid gains in this segment of business\nspending.\n\nHousing was seen as another important sector of the economy\nthat was likely to exert a retarding effect on the expansion as the\nrise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was felt\nincreasingly in housing markets. The anecdotal information from\naround the nation and the available statistics suggested, however,\nthat those markets generally had remained surprisingly ebullient thus\nfar, and there were only limited indications of some softening in home\nconstruction activity.\n\nBusiness inventory investment was viewed as a key upside risk\nin the economic outlook for coming quarters. An inventory overhang at\nthe end of last year had been corrected in the first quarter, and\ninventory investment was indicated to have turned positive again in\nthe second quarter. However, current inventory-to-sales ratios\nappeared to be relatively lean, and final sales that exceeded current\nexpectations might well induce a sharp upward adjustment in inventory\naccumulation, especially if lead times were to lengthen and producers\nperceived shortfalls in their safety stocks.\n\nMembers viewed the outlook for inflation as a source of\nsubstantial uncertainty in their forecasts, though many saw reasonable\nprospects that a rate of economic expansion in line with their forecasts\nand associated levels of capacity utilization would prove to be\nconsistent with little change in the core rate of inflation. Some\nimportant measures of price inflation, after adjustment to exclude\ntheir volatile food and energy components, had shown a flat or even a\ndeclining trend in recent quarters. The outlook for overall price\nincreases would remain contingent in part on food and energy price\ndevelopments, but more importantly on underlying cost pressures in the\neconomy.\n\nSeveral members commented that the levels of utilization of\ncapital and labor resources that had prevailed over the past couple of\nyears would have been expected, on the basis of past historical\npatterns, to foster rising cost pressures and greater inflation.\nHowever, labor compensation gains had been subdued in relation to\nearlier cyclical experience, likely as a consequence of increased\nworker concerns about job security and job opportunities. Despite the\ncontinued low rate of unemployment and widespread anecdotal reports of\ntight labor markets across the country, there were only limited\nindications in national data that wage inflation might be increasing.\nWhether greater labor cost pressures would emerge in the context of\nthe members' consensus forecast for economic activity was a critical\nissue in the outlook for prices, though it was noted that at least\nsome of the rising costs were likely to be absorbed in shrinking\nprofit margins. Even if greater price inflation were averted under\nthat scenario, the members saw a substantial risk that if economic\ngrowth did not slow in line with their current forecasts, the\nresulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate\ninto higher price inflation. Accordingly, the factors bearing on the\noutlook for resource use and inflation needed to be monitored with\nspecial care in this period.\n\nWith regard to inflation over the long run, the members\nagreed that it was essential for the Committee to continue to focus on\nreducing inflation over time because the achievement of an even less\ninflationary economic environment would foster a more productive\neconomy and maximum sustainable economic expansion. The members\nacknowledged that as inflation diminished to very low levels,\nquestions about the measurement of the overall price level presented\ndifficult problems for assessing progress toward price stability.\nSome also observed that the precise level of average price inflation\nthat might be compatible with the optimal functioning of the economy\nwas an unsettled issue owing, for example, to potential rigidities in\nlabor markets. Thus far, such rigidities had not impeded the economy\nfrom functioning at a very high level as inflation came down, and\ncontinued adaptation to even lower inflation rates was very likely.\nHowever, the Committee would need to pay careful attention to these\npotential problems as inflation fell further. For now, the members\nagreed that some additional progress in reducing inflation was very\nlikely to improve the ultimate performance of the economy, and that it\nwas particularly important at this juncture to resist firmly any\ntendency for inflation to worsen.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in January for 1996 and it\ndecided on tentative ranges for those aggregates for 1997. The\ncurrent ranges set in January for the period from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996 were unchanged from the ranges\nfor 1995 and included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6\npercent for M3. An unchanged monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent was\nset in January for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1996.\n\nA majority of the members favored retaining the current\nranges for this year and extending them on a provisional basis to\n1997. They anticipated that growth of M2 and M3 probably would\ncontinue at rates close to the upper limit of their respective ranges\nin both years, given the Committee's expectations for the performance\nof the economy and prices. However, despite a degree of concern about\nsetting ranges that did not more comfortably encompass expected\ngrowth, these members preferred not to change the ranges for a variety\nof reasons. The current ranges for the broad monetary aggregates\ncould be viewed as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would\nbe associated with approximate price stability and sustained economic\ngrowth, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical\nexperience. Accordingly, a reaffirmation of those ranges would\nunderscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price\nstability over time; and in the view of some members, higher ranges\ncould raise questions in this regard. Moreover, a change in the\nranges might be misinterpreted as a signal of greater reliance on the\nbroad monetary aggregates in the formulation and conduct of monetary\npolicy. In this connection, the members noted that the behavior of M2\nin relation to nominal GDP and interest rates had displayed a pattern\nover the past two years or so that was in line with historical norms\nprior to the 1990s. However, in light of difficulties in the early\n1990s and changes in financial markets, the prospective growth of M2\nand its velocity remained subject to considerable uncertainty and the\nmembers felt that it would be premature for the Committee to place\nincreased reliance on M2 at this point.\n\nThe Committee members were unanimously in favor of retaining\nthe current monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt in 1996 and extending that range on a\nprovisional basis to 1997. They took account of a staff projection\nindicating that growth of the debt aggregate was likely to slow\nsomewhat from its pace earlier this year in line with some moderation\nin the expansion of nominal income. According to the staff\nprojection, growth in the debt measure would be near the midpoint of\nthe existing range over the period through 1997.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to\nreaffirm the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 and the monitoring range\nfor expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had\nestablished in January for 1996. For the year 1997, the Committee\napproved provisional ranges for M2 and M3 and a provisional monitoring\nrange for total domestic nonfinancial debt that were unchanged from\nthe 1996 ranges. In keeping with its usual procedure under the\nHumphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its preliminary\nranges for 1997 early next year, or sooner if interim conditions\nwarranted, in light of their growth and velocity behavior and ongoing\neconomic and financial developments. Accordingly, the Committee voted\nto incorporate the following statement regarding the 1996 and 1997\nranges in its domestic policy directive:\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, McTeer, Meyer,\nMses. Phillips and Rivlin, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Lindsey and\nMs. Yellen.\n\nMr. Lindsey and Ms. Yellen dissented because they preferred\nsomewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3 growth in 1996 and 1997. The\ncentral tendencies of the members' forecasts of nominal GDP for the\ntwo years were likely to be associated with growth of the broad\nmonetary aggregates at rates around the top of the current ranges.\nSomewhat higher ranges would more comfortably encompass the\nanticipated growth of the monetary aggregates and in their view would\nconform more closely with the provisions and intent of the Federal\nReserve Act that require the System to communicate its objectives and\nplans for monetary growth to the Congress. They believed the reasons\nfor raising the ranges could easily be explained and understood as a\ntechnical adjustment that did not represent a reduced commitment to\nthe goal of price stability or an increased emphasis on the monetary\naggregates in policy formulation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one of the members supported a proposal to\nmaintain an unchanged policy stance. These members also indicated\nthat they preferred or could accept an asymmetric directive that was\nbiased toward restraint. In their view, the most likely outcome was a\nslowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation\nof subdued inflation. Nevertheless, they were concerned that the\nrisks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation, While a\nstrong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels\nof resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be\nsustainable because it would have the potential for adding\nsignificantly to inflation pressures. However, inflation had remained\nrelatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other\nfactors was expected to curb demand. Moreover, any tendency for price\npressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be\nreversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. The\ncurrent stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view\nas clearly accommodative. While the federal funds rate had been\nreduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current\nlevel on an inflation-adjusted basis seemed to be only marginally\nbelow its peak prior to mid-1995. In the circumstances, the Committee\ncould afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional\ninflation pressures were likely to develop. A number of key economic\ndata would become available over the next several weeks that would\nprovide a much better basis for assessing the economy's momentum over\nthe second half of the year and the outlook for inflation.\n\nA differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising\ninflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of\ncost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion. There\nwas little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports\nof appreciable wage pressures were increasing. Inflation expectations\npersisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor\nmarkets as well; if they were allowed to worsen, the Committee's long-run\ngoal of price stability would become much more difficult to\nachieve. Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in\npolicy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy.\n\nMembers observed that an asymmetric directive would represent\na shift from the symmetric directives that had been adopted over the\npast year but would be in keeping with their assessments of the risks\nof higher inflation. Several commented that an asymmetric directive\ndid not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point,\nwhether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it\ndid imply the need for special vigilance. Some noted that a policy\ntightening action could tend to have a more pronounced effect than\nusual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and\nmight generate expectations of further tightening. Under the\ncircumstances, the Committee would consult in some way before any\npolicy tightening was undertaken.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have edged higher since\nthe Committee meeting on May 21. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms\nof the other G-10 currencies has depreciated slightly\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nM2 declined in May, though partial data for June\npointed to a rebound. Growth of M3 was relatively\nsluggish in May but also appears to have turned up in\nJune. For the year through June, both aggregates are\nestimated to have grown at rates around the upper bounds\nof their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on\nbalance over recent months and has remained in the middle\nportion of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this\nmeeting the ranges it had established in January for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee\nagreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured\nfrom the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of\n1997, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3.\nThe Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring\nrange for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at\n3 to 7 percent for 1997. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of\nprogress toward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for short-run policy:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer,\nMeyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and Yellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Stern.\n\nMr. Stern dissented because he was convinced that a modestly\nmore restrictive policy was warranted. In his view, the momentum of\nthe economy and strains on capacity in labor and some other markets\nraised the possibility of an acceleration of inflation that would\njeopardize the economic expansion. This concern aside, Mr. Stern also\nbelieved that current circumstances were favorable for policy action\nto reduce inflation further and thereby help to sustain the ongoing\nimprovement in the economy.\n\nAs a prelude to its formal review later in the year, the\nCommittee at this meeting considered its existing network of swap\narrangements with a number of foreign central banks and the Bank for\nInternational Settlements. From time to time in recent years, the\nCommittee had discussed a variety of issues relating to its foreign\nexchange activities and its financial arrangements with other central\nbanks. In this discusssion, the Committee considered in particular\nwhether the swap arrangements, all of which had been put in place in\nthe 1960s, remained an appropriate approach to international financial\ncooperation among central banks in light of the evolution of the\ninternational financial system in recent decades, and whether other\napproaches should be considered. The Committee made no decisions\nrelating to these matters, though it was understood that these issues\nwould be explored further.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held\non Tuesday, August 20, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m.\n\nAttended portion of meeting concerning issues relating to the\nlong-run price objective for monetary policy.\n\nAttended portion of the meeting relating to the Committee's\ndiscussion of the economic outlook and its longer-run growth ranges\nfor the monetary and debt aggregates.\n\nAttended portion of the meeting relating to the Committee's review\nof its swap line agreements."
