By unanimous vote,\nthe Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for\nDomestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion\nto $11 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System\nAccount holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for\nthe intermeeting period ending with the close of business on May 17,\n1994.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that\neconomic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months\nof 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending\nand construction activity had been held down to some extent by the\nadverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued\nat a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be\nheaded for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory\nutilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to\nhave grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices,\nincreases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained\nmoderate.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but\nposted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases\nrecorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service\nindustries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially\nin February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but\nthe number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting\nthat industry's vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian\nunemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in\nFebruary: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a\nvariety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in\njoblessness in early 1994.\n\nAfter a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial\nproduction increased considerably further in January and February.\nManufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping\neffect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of\nmotor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half\nof the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of\nthe year and reaching in February their highest level since the late\n1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles\nalso was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than\nthose of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting\nthe heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but\na portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of\nindustrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at\nrelatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating\nrates in primary processing industries were especially high.\n\nRetail sales were little changed on balance over the first\ntwo months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large\nJanuary decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite\nbrisk on average over the two months, despite the California\nearthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating\ncontributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in\nJanuary. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts\nwere down considerably in January and February from the very high\nlevels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of\nexisting homes in January were only slightly below their high December\nlevel.\n\nThe limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably\nsmaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994\nafter a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of\nnondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the\nsharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent\nmonths pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months.\nSales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of\norders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction\nactivity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January\nafter trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in\noffice building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two\nmonths.\n\nBusiness inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks\nwere lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in\nmanufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December\ndecline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At\nboth the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable\ndecreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio\nedged down and had changed little since May of last year. The\ninventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly,\nreflecting weak sales in January.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services,\nmeasured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in\nJanuary than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January\ndeficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports\ndown by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in\nagricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly\nreflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The\nlimited available data suggested that economic activity in the major\nforeign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed\nperformance in the fourth quarter of 1993.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by\na surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil,\nthat more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the\nfood and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February:\nfor the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by\na significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended\nin February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in\nFebruary were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food\nand energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months\nended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly\nearnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly\nin February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance\nwas about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of\n1994.\n\nImmediately following the February meeting, Chairman\nGreenspan announced the Committee's decision, and open market\noperations were directed toward implementing the slightly less\naccommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee.\nThe federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then\nremained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while\nadjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than\nanticipated.\n\nMost other market interest rates rose considerably more than\nthe federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market\nparticipants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary\npolicy, but the Committee's action apparently came a little sooner\nthan had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and\nevidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater\ncredit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to\ncontain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market\nconditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these\ncircumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased\nby appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes\nof stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in\nsometimes volatile trading.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary\npolicy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the\nintermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and\nthe release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic\nactivity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the\nGerman mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and\ndisappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to\nbe contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond\nyields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average\nby almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.\n\nM2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A\nsubstantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that\ndepressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected\nby a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors\nreacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads\nbetween returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term\ninstruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both\nmonetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that\ninvolved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker\ninflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at\na moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth\nquarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly\nin excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had\ntended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to\nincrease at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on\ndurable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some\nrestraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less\nrapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier\npickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow.\nHomebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively\nbrisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing\nand the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes.\nThe restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak\nexport demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the\nlimited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were\nexpected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further\nreduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members referred to widespread indications of\nappreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins\nof unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members\ncontinued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the\nvery rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite\nunusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the\ndeceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had\nexpected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand\nalong with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much\nreduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members\ncontinued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a\ntime at a rate somewhat above the economy's potential. The amount of\nresources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was\nsubject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the\neconomy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to\nrelatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate\noutlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being\ncontained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for\nproductivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad\nwhere slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and\ncredit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained\nmoderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead,\nmembers were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted\nfurther from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources\nwould intensify and inflation would pick up.\n\nMembers assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices\nagainst the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent,\nequity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening\nof reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in\nmarket movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members\nvariously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates\nhad reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about\nthe course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and\nforeign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary\nparticipants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance,\nfinancial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic\nexpansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more\naccommodative lending policies of many depository institutions;\nhowever, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low\nprobability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could\nat some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and\nconsumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was\ndescribed as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although\nthere were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented\non numerous indications of improving regional economies.\n\nA number of members observed that they expected consumer\nspending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable\nstrength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer\ndurables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country\ntended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers\nwere expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the\nsame time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely\nto limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred\nin particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer\nindebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by\nhouseholds. More importantly, however, consumer confidence and\nspending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further\ngrowth in employment and incomes.\n\nBusiness investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend\nas firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve\noperating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures.\nMembers also cited some examples of investment spending induced by\nrising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity.\nWhile business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more\nproductive equipment, nonresidential construction also had\nstrengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to\nconfirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of\nnonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in\ncommercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the\nconstruction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector\nappeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a\nlong period of decline. More generally, currently positive business\nattitudes augured well for further growth in overall business\ninvestment, but on the negative side it was noted that further\nturbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse\nimplications for investment spending. Residential construction was\ndescribed as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing\nconstruction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter\nweather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled\nconstruction workers and building materials were reported in many\nareas.\n\nDespite generally rising final demands, business firms were\ncontinuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing\nefforts to hold down costs. Nonetheless, with production levels in\nmany industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization,\nprices of some materials and other business purchases coming under\nincreasing pressure, and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at\nleast in some industries, efforts to build inventories could be\nexpected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a\ndevelopment represented a key upside risk from current forecasts. In\nthis connection, some members referred to scattered indications of\nefforts to increase inventories, notably of steel products.\nManufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding\ndepleted inventories, though the currently stimulative impact of such\nrebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor\nvehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead.\n\nThe foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative\nfactor in the economic outlook. However, the members anticipated some\nimprovement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations\nwhich, together with some moderation in the growth of domestic final\ndemands, was likely to slow the decline in real net exports. A few\nmembers cited growing indications that last year's NAFTA legislation\nwould have quite positive effects on U.S. foreign trade, though those\neffects were still largely in the future.\n\nIn the discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, many\nof the members expressed concern about the potential for a pickup in\ninflation if, as they anticipated, margins of unemployed resources\nnarrowed further or disappeared. The members acknowledged that broad\nmeasures of prices relating to final purchases and of wages currently\ndid not suggest any increase in inflation. Indeed, in the view of at\nleast some members, those measures still suggested on balance that the\ninflation trend had retained a downward tilt thus far. In this\nconnection, some commented that the overall performance of the broad\nmeasures had been somewhat better in recent months than they had\nanticipated, especially given the very rapid expansion of the economy\nover the closing months of 1993 and the less than expected moderation\nthus far this year. Developments that had been exerting a favorable\neffect on prices included above-trend growth in productivity,\nrelatively low prices in world oil markets, and strong competition in\nmany markets from both domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, the\nstrong rise in credit usage that often had accompanied intensified\ninflation pressures in the past had yet to materialize. To date, the\npickup in price increases had been uneven and had tended to be\nconcentrated in some regions or industries and in the early stages of\nthe production process, and a number of members reported that they saw\nlittle change in inflation trends in their areas. Nonetheless,\nwarning signs had emerged of the prospect of greater inflation, though\nperhaps not over the nearer term. These included increases in a wide\nrange of commodity prices and anecdotal reports from various parts of\nthe country suggesting a further rise in the number of business firms\nthat were facing somewhat higher prices of materials and other\npurchases and in turn were able, often for the first time in recent\nyears, to raise their selling prices. Price and wage pressures\nappeared to be especially pronounced in the construction industry,\nwhere capacity constraints had been encountered in many localities.\nMembers also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food\nand energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food\nprices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they\nmaterialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were\nlikely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth\naccelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world\nsupplies. More fundamentally, the relatively robust economic\nexpansion over the second half of 1993 and the further advance in\nearly 1994 appeared in the view of many members to have appreciably\ndiminished the gap between actual and potential GDP and to have\nreduced the rate of unemployment to a level that could well be not far\nfrom the natural rate. If this assessment proved to be correct,\nfurther economic expansion at a pace above the economy's potential\nwould bring more industries and the economy more generally to capacity\nproduction levels before very long and could well-generate growing\ninflation thereafter.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less\naccommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had\nbeen made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary\npolicy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low\ninflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an\nindicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also\nreferred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money\nover an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance\nhad been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when\nconstraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and\nbusiness restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the\nexpansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly\ndiminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum.\nIn the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy\ncould be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor\nand capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While\nactual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped,\nit was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy\ninduced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of\ninflation.\n\nIn these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary\npolicy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be\ndefined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with\nchanging circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual\napproach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as\na policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary\nexpansion consistent with the economy's potential. The members\ngenerally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance\naway, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how\npromptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether\nfurther tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not\nbe determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence\nof conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.\n\nAs had been the case at the February meeting, views differed\non how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this\nmeeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would\nhave to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given\nunderlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference\nfor another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a\npossible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite\nsensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some\nemphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate\nof economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the\nexpansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was\ncurrently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable\nto permit an assessment of ongoing developments.\n\nMembers who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or\nperhaps a small move through open market operations that was\nassociated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the\nincreasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more\npromptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become\noverly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would\nserve to underscore the Committee's commitment to its price stability\nobjective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted\nas a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier\nin the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have\nbeneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view\nof some members, continued market expectations of further actions to\ntighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market\ninstability. Some members also commented that any policy choice\nincurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest\nrisk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary\npressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led\nto the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more\nreadily and with less damage to the economy in this view.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting\nadjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the\nmembers indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive.\nWhile the probability of an easing action during this period was\ndeemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any\nfirming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented\nafter today's meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of\nmoving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more\nneutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not\nindependent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not\nas dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at\nother times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did\nnot rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on\nbehalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the\npast when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members\nwho favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive\nseemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy\ntoward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to\nindications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated,\nhowever, that they could support a symmetric directive that was\nassociated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all\nbut two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive\nthat called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that did not include a presumption about the likely\ndirection of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.\nAccording to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at\nthis meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3\nover the first half of 1994.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity has expanded appreciably further\nin the early months of 1994. Severe weather and\nchanges in statistical methodology distorted movements\nin official labor market data in January and February,\nbut it appears that employment increased somewhat on\nbalance over the two months and that unemployment fell.\nIndustrial production also increased substantially over\nthis period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter.\nConsumer spending and housing activity apparently have\nbeen held down to some extent by adverse weather in\nJanuary and February: retail sales were little changed\non balance over the two months and housing starts fell\nconsiderably. Trends in contracts and orders point to\na sizable increase in business fixed investment but at\na rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993.\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nin January was slightly smaller than the average in the\nfourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer\nand producer prices have remained moderate in recent\nmonths despite a surge in energy prices.\n\nMost market interest rates have risen considerably\nsince the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies\ndepreciated over the intermeeting period.\n\nM2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in\nFebruary, but data for early March point to some\nrebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent\nmonths.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in February established ranges for growth of M2\nand M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that\ndevelopments contributing to unusual velocity increases\ncould persist during the year and that money growth\nwithin these ranges would be consistent with its broad\npolicy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions. In\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the\nfirst half of 1994.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey,\nParry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Broaddus,\nand Jordan.\n\nMessrs. Broaddus and Jordan dissented because they preferred\na stronger move toward a more neutral policy stance. In their view,\nthe recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates indicated\nclearly that inflationary expectations were rising and that the\nprincipal policy risk had become one of remaining accommodative for\ntoo long a period. In this environment, they believed that a more\naggressive move would underscore the Committee's commitment to\nfostering sustainable longer-term growth and reduce the risk that a\nhighly restrictive policy might be required at a later date to contain\ninflation.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the desirability\nof making an immediate announcement of today's policy decision. All\nthe members favored prompt disclosure in principle, but some expressed\nreservations about announcing today's decision immediately after the\nmeeting. These members preferred to consider a decision on\nannouncements of policy actions in the context of a broad range of\ndisclosure issues, some of which had yet to be fully explored. Some\nstressed that they remained concerned about the inhibiting effects of\nsome types of disclosures on the Committee's deliberations, and one\nmember emphasized that the Committee also needed to consider the\nimplications of immediate announcements of changes in open market\npolicy for the role of the discount rate. Several members commented\nthat announcing a decision reached at this meeting, because it would\ncome after a similar announcement following the most recent meeting in\nearly February, would in effect set a precedent that would tend to\nlimit the Committee's future options. A majority of the members\nconcluded, however, that while the Committee was not making a formal, binding decision on this issue at this meeting, the Chairman would be\nauthorized to release a short press statement regarding today's policy\ndecision. A useful purpose would be served in reducing or eliminating\npotential misinterpretation of the Committee's policy decision and the\nrelated risk of overreactions in financial markets at a time of\nconsiderable uncertainty and volatility in those markets. The news of\nthe Committee's action would be conveyed unambiguously to the entire\npublic at once and not filtered through the financial markets'\ninterpretation of open market operations. Moreover, the Committee\nwould retain the option of specifying the exact contents and timing of\nfuture policy announcements, including intermeeting policy actions.\nMost of the members concluded that the advantages to the public of\nprompt release today outweighed the potential disadvantages.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, May 17. 1994. This meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.\n\nAt a telephone conference held on March 24, 1994, the\nCommittee approved a temporary increase, from $700 million to $3.0\nbillion, in the Federal Reserve System's reciprocal currency (\"swap\")\narrangement with the Bank of Mexico. Concurrently, the U.S. Treasury\nannounced a $3 billion swap arrangement between the U.S. Exchange\nStabilization Fund and the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican Ministry of\nFinance. The System's action was effective immediately and. subject\nto certain conditions, it authorized the Bank of Mexico to draw on the\nenlarged arrangement until April 29, 1994, with full repayment of any\ndrawings to be made by July 29, 1994.\n\nA permanent increase in the System's swap arrangement with\nthe Bank of Mexico had been discussed at the Committee's recent\nmeeting on March 22, and it had been contemplated at that meeting that\nthe Committee would vote on such an increase during April in the\ncontext of the establishment of a consultative mechanism involving the\nfinance ministries and central banks of Canada, Mexico, and the United\nStates. However, the assassination of a major candidate for the\npresidency of Mexico on the evening of March 23 had prompted the\nclosing of Mexican financial markets on March 24 and had given rise to\nconcerns regarding possible financial market disorder in reaction to\nunfolding political developments when those markets reopened. Against\nthis background, the Committee decided to join the U.S. Treasury in an\naction that would help confirm continued U.S. support for Mexico's\neconomic policies at a potentially critical time for Mexican financial\nmarkets.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nEffective April 26, 1994, the Committee by notation vote\napproved a recommendation by Chairman Greenspan to establish an\nenlarged swap arrangement of $3 billion on a permanent basis. As is\nthe case for all swap arrangements, this arrangement is subject to\nperiodic annual review after an initial maturity date of December 15,\n1995. Simultaneously, the maturity date of the System's swap facility\nwith the Bank of Canada was extended by one year to December 15, 1995.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nThe enlarged foreign exchange swap arrangement with the Bank\nof Mexico constituted part of a new trilateral foreign exchange swap\nfacility established in connection with the newly formed consultative\ngroup called the North American Financial Group and comprised of the\nFinance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of Canada, Mexico, and\nthe United States. The purpose of this standing facility is to expand\nthe pool of potential resources available to the monetary authorities\nof each country to maintain orderly exchange markets. Its\nestablishment at this time was deemed desirable in light of the\noutlook for expanding and increasingly interdependent economic\nrelationships among the three economies following the successful\nconclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThe components of the trilateral facility include (1) swap\nagreements between the United States and Mexico for up to $6.0\nbillion, with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve each participating\nup to $3.0 billion; (2) an expansion of the swap agreement between the\nBank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico to CAN$1.0 billion; and (3) a\nreaffirmation of the existing swap agreement between the Bank of\nCanada and the Federal Reserve in the amount of $2.0 billion, with the\nabove-noted maturity extension.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he was concerned about the\nappropriateness of the System's involvement in this type of foreign\ncurrency operation. In his view, the System's swap network raised a\nnumber of broad issues that he felt the Committee needed to review at\nsome point. Accordingly, he would not favor increasing any existing\nswap arrangement until such a review had taken place.\n\nAt a telephone conference on April 18, Committee members\nreviewed economic and financial developments since the March meeting\nand discussed the desirability of taking further action to move policy\naway from its still accommodative stance. Broad indicators of\neconomic activity, supported by widespread anecdotal evidence, pointed\nto considerable momentum in economic activity and further reductions\nin already limited margins of unutilized labor and other production\nresources. In financial markets, sharp declines in bond and stock\nprices suggested that speculative excesses had been reduced, and\nongoing portfolio realignments probably were shifting long-term\nfinancial assets to firmer hands. As a result, financial markets now\nappeared to be less likely to overreact to adverse developments or to\npolicy actions. In the circumstances, the members supported the\nChairman's decision to reduce the degree of accommodation in reserve\nmarkets slightly further at this time rather than to await the next\nregularly scheduled meeting in mid-May. Some members expressed the\nview that an increase in the discount rate would provide a desirable\nsupplement to this policy action.\n\nSecretary\n\nFOMC"
