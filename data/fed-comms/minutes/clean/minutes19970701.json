There were no System open market transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period May 20,\n1997, through June 30, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1997 and 1998,\nand the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period\nahead. A summary of the economic and financial information available\nat the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is\nprovided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomic expansion slowed substantially in the second quarter after\nhaving surged in late 1996 and earlier this year. Consumer spending\ndecelerated considerably, but business spending on durable equipment\nincreased substantially further and housing demand appeared to have\nbeen well maintained. Employment growth moderated recently, while\nindustrial production continued to rise appreciably. Price inflation\nremained subdued despite high rates of resource utilization, notably\nthat of labor.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment rose at a reduced pace in\nMay after having registered sizable advances over the first four\nmonths of the year. Job growth remained brisk in the services sector\ndespite a further drop in employment at temporary help agencies that\nmight have reflected constraints on the availability of workers for\nhire. Although employment in construction recovered in May from the\nweather-depressed level in April, the underlying growth in such jobs\nseemed to have slowed. Employment in manufacturing changed little\nover April and May after having increased moderately in the first\nquarter. The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory\nworkers was unchanged in May but was slightly below the average for\nthe first quarter. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly\nfurther to 4.8 percent in May.\n\nIndustrial production continued to grow briskly in May.\nManufacturing output recorded a substantial gain and mining production\nrose considerably; however, cooler-than-average weather led to a drop\nin utility output. Much of the rise in manufacturing reflected a\nrebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts from strike-depressed\nlevels in April and strength in the output of business\nequipment, construction supplies, and materials. With output\ngenerally keeping pace with the rapid expansion of factory capacity,\nthe rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity remained at a\nrelatively high level.\n\nPersonal consumption expenditures, in real terms, rose\nsubstantially in May after having changed little on balance over the\npreceding three months. Spending on services remained on a solid\nuptrend in May, while aggregate purchases of goods turned up after\nthree months of lackluster spending on nondurable goods and motor\nvehicles. The unusual weather patterns of late winter and early\nspring apparently had a depressing effect on consumer expenditures,\nespecially for seasonal items; however, the combination of strong job\ngains, buoyant sentiment, and increased household net worth pointed to\na possible resumption of more robust spending by consumers.\n\nHousing activity appeared to have been generally well\nmaintained in recent months. Although housing starts were down\nsomewhat in May from the relatively elevated average rate for the\nfirst four months of the year, this slowing might have been, at least\nin part, the result of unusually mild winter weather that enabled an\nearly start on spring building activity. The latest information on\nhome sales suggested continued firm demand for single-family housing:\nSales of existing homes rose in May and were among the highest monthly\ntotals on record, and sales of new homes in April (latest data\navailable) were down only a little from the brisk pace of earlier\nmonths in the year.\n\nAvailable information suggested further sizable gains in\nbusiness fixed investment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods\nedged higher in May after posting large increases in earlier months of\nthe year. Shipments of computers had been particularly strong this\nyear in conjunction with rapidly falling prices, but shipments of\nother categories of capital goods also had been robust on balance.\nRecent data on orders pointed to further brisk growth in coming\nmonths. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to have eased\nrecently, with construction-put-in-place slipping in March and April\nfrom the elevated pace of the first two months of the year. However,\nother information suggested that the downturn might be shortlived:\nVacancy rates for office space had been declining, prices for\ncommercial real estate had been edging up, and recent data on\ncontracts suggested that building activity would improve in coming\nmonths.\n\nBusiness inventory investment picked up sharply in April from\nthe slow pace in March but, overall, stocks remained at a low level in\nrelation to sales. In manufacturing, much of the increase in stocks\noccurred in capital goods industries in which production was expanding\nbriskly. In the wholesale sector, a substantial decline in stocks in\nApril more than offset a sizable increase in March, and the aggregate\nstock-sales ratio for the sector fell further over the March-April\nperiod. Retail inventories rose considerably in April, with notable\nincreases in stocks of apparel and general merchandise. In a\ndeparture from the general downtrend of recent months, inventory-sales\nratios for most types of retail establishments were up appreciably in\nApril.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed somewhat in April from a downward-revised average rate in the\nfirst quarter. The value of exports in April rose substantially from\nthe first-quarter level, led by increases in exports of machinery and\naircraft. The value of imports also rose but by less than that of\nexports; imports were up in most trade categories except petroleum\nproducts. Recent information suggested that, on average, economic\nactivity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to grow\nat a moderate rate in the second quarter. Growth remained robust in\nCanada and the United Kingdom and was improving in Germany, France,\nand Italy. Economic activity appeared to have flattened temporarily\nin Japan following an increase in the consumption tax in April.\n\nPrice inflation remained subdued. For a third straight\nmonth, consumer prices recorded only a slight increase in May.\nFavorable developments in food and energy continued to hold down the\noverall rise and accounted for a much smaller advance in the index of\nprices of all consumer items over the twelve months ended in May than\nover the previous twelve months. The decline in core CPI inflation\nover the same time period was much less, though this measure of\ninflation also remained relatively restrained. At the producer level,\nprices of finished goods other than food and energy fell further in\nMay and were little changed over the year ended that month. At\nearlier stages of processing, producer prices for intermediate\nmaterials other than food and energy changed little over the year\nended in May, and producer prices at the crude level advanced only\nslightly. The tight conditions prevailing in labor markets were\nassociated with a somewhat larger increase in average hourly earnings\nin the twelve months ended in May than in the year-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on May 20, 1997, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions. Because the members saw the potential need for\nsome tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary\npressures, perhaps in the relatively near term, the directive included\na bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting\nperiod toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on\nreserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged close to the\nintended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other market interest rates\ndeclined somewhat on balance during the period. Market participants\napparently concluded that the likelihood of further policy tightening\nhad decreased substantially in light of incoming data that suggested\nslowing growth of final demand and continued subdued inflation. Share\nprices in equity markets rose considerably further.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was up on balance over\nthe intermeeting period; the advance occurred despite a smaller\ndecline on average in long-term interest rates abroad than in the\nUnited States. The dollar rose appreciably against the German mark\nand most other continental European currencies amid growing market\nconcerns that there would be broad participation in the European\nMonetary Union despite the fact that the major European countries\nwould not be able to comply strictly with the Maastricht fiscal\nstandards and related expectations that the euro would be a weak\ncurrency. In contrast, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen and\nthe British pound; the yen moved up as markets focused more closely on\nrecent and prospective increases in Japan's current account surplus,\nand the pound strengthened in anticipation of further policy\ntightening by the Bank of England.\n\nExpansion of M2 and M3 slowed sharply in May in association\nwith a swing in household balances related to large tax payments;\ngrowth of M2 rebounded in June, but M3 accelerated by less. For the\nyear through June, M2 increased at a rate near the upper bound of its\nrange for the year. Rapid growth of M3 over the first half of the\nyear, partly in conjunction with robust expansion of bank credit,\nplaced growth of this aggregate somewhat above the upper bound of its\nrange. The rate of increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt had\nbeen a little higher in recent months; for the year to date, this\naggregate had grown at a rate near the middle of its range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy would expand at a pace somewhat above that of its\nestimated potential in the second half of the year but would slow to a\nrate of increase more in line with that of potential in 1998. Growth\nof consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and\nfurther projected gains in employment and income, was expected to be\nrelatively brisk for some time. Business spending on equipment and\nstructures was anticipated to continue outpacing the overall expansion\nof the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow in\nassociation with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and\nprofits that was expected to occur in the context of moderating\neconomic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower\nover the forecast period. The staff anticipated that fiscal policy\nand the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of\neconomic activity. With labor compensation gradually accelerating in\nthe context of high resource utilization, core consumer price\ninflation was forecast to drift slightly higher.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on the continuing exceptional\nperformance of the economy, including widespread indications of\nstrength in business activity and subdued inflation. Following a\nsurge in late 1996 and earlier this year, the rate of expansion had\nmoderated considerably in recent months, and the members generally\nexpected economic activity to settle into a pattern of growth over the\nnext six quarters that would approximate the economy's estimated\noutput potential. A major factor in that outlook was their expectation\nof some deceleration in demands for consumer durables and\nbusiness plant and equipment in light of the substantial buildup of\nsuch assets that already had taken place in recent years. However,\ngiven the underlying strength of the expansion, favorable financial\nconditions, and the absence of major imbalances in the economy, the\nrisks of a different outcome were judged to be in the direction of\nsomewhat faster growth than currently projected. The outlook for\ninflation was subject to particular uncertainty. Despite an economy\nthat had been operating for a considerable period at rates of resource\nutilization that were very close to, and by some estimates somewhat\nabove, sustainable levels, inflation had remained relatively low and\nindeed had declined on the basis of some broad measures of prices.\nSuch an outcome was very much welcome, but the reasons for it were not\ncompletely understood and appeared to include some factors that might\nexert only temporary restraint on price increases. Consequently,\ncontinuing pressures on resources associated with economic growth in\nline with the members' current forecasts could well be reflected in\nrising inflation over time.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nsets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the\nmembers of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not\ncurrently serving as members provided individual projections of the\ngrowth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate\nof inflation for the years 1997 and 1998. The forecasts of the rate\nof expansion in real GDP for 1997 as a whole had a central tendency of\n3 to 3-1/4 percent and for 1998 were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2\npercent. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the\nforecasts were in ranges of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1997 and 4-1/2 to 5\npercent for 1998. The civilian rate of unemployment associated with\nthese forecasts had a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent in the\nfourth quarters of both years. Projections of the rate of inflation,\nas measured by the consumer price index, pointed to a sizable\nmoderation this year from the rate in 1996 and a partially offsetting\nrise in 1998, with prices of food and energy accounting for much of\nthe swing. Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation\nrates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in\n1998.\n\nIn their review of the outlook for economic activity in major\nsectors of the economy, members referred to the generally sluggish\npace of retail sales in recent months. It was noted, however, that\nthe slowdown was perhaps in part an adjustment to very strong growth\nof sales in previous months, and some members commented on anecdotal\nindications of some pickup in recent weeks. More importantly,\nunderlying trends and fundamentals pointed to prospective growth in\nconsumer expenditures at a pace that was likely to continue to provide\nkey support for further moderate expansion in overall economic\nactivity. In particular, jobs and incomes had continued to post\nsizable gains; further large increases in stock market prices had\nraised wealth-to-income ratios sharply; and consumer optimism had\nrisen to new highs. On the other hand, the accumulation of consumer\ndurables that had occurred over the course of the current cyclical\nadvance was likely to exert a retarding influence on the rise in\nconsumer spending. Other somewhat restraining factors included the\nprospect of some softening in housing demand and related purchases of\nhousehold goods and the already heavy debt repayment burdens of many\nconsumers. Some members also noted that a possible correction from\nthe currently elevated levels of stock market prices could have\nadverse effects on consumer sentiment and purchasing power. On\nbalance, growth in personal consumer expenditures was seen as likely\nto approximate the moderate rate of increase projected in overall\ndomestic demand.\n\nThe members viewed the prospects for further growth in\nbusiness fixed investment as another important supportive factor in\nthe outlook for sustained economic expansion. Current indicators\npointed to the continuation of very rapid growth in such spending over\nthe near term, but some moderation was likely over the course of\ncoming quarters in conjunction with the projected slowing in the\nincrease of overall demand and the very large buildup in the stock of\ncapital that already had occurred in recent years. Even so,\ninvestment spending was likely to be relatively robust over the\nprojection horizon in the context of continuing incentives to hold\ndown production costs in highly competitive markets and to take\nadvantage of falling prices and wider applications for certain types\nof new equipment, notably computer-related equipment. The ready\navailability of both debt and equity finance on favorable terms, an\nupbeat outlook for sales in many industries, and generally high profit\nlevels were other positive factors. The outlook for nonresidential\nconstruction activity also seemed to be relatively favorable. Members\nreferred to declining vacancy rates and rising rents for commercial\nstructures in many parts of the country and noted that construction\ncontracts for new office buildings and hotels recently had turned up\non a nationwide basis after a pause earlier this year. In sum, the\ngrowth in business fixed investment seemed likely to continue to\noutpace that of overall demand in coming quarters.\n\nSome restraint on aggregate demand would come from other\nsectors of the economy--notably government spending, net exports,\nhousing, and perhaps business inventories. None of these factors\nseemed likely to exert a substantially negative effect, but in total\nthey were expected to help keep the pace of the expansion close to the\nestimated rate of increase in the economy's potential over coming\nquarters.\n\nDuring the course of the Committee's discussion, many of the\nmembers commented on the persistence of an impressively benign inflation\nperformance despite widespread indications of very high, and by\nsome measures increasing, levels of capacity use. Indeed, most broad\nmeasures of prices pointed to subdued or even declining inflation, and\nit was difficult to find evidence of rising inflation pressures in\n\"pipeline\" price data or the wage structure. The members anticipated\nthat inflation as measured by the consumer price index would decline\nappreciably over 1997 as a result of favorable developments in the\nfood and especially the energy sectors of the economy and declining\nimport prices associated with the previous appreciation of the dollar.\nThese positive influences would wane over time, however, and consumer\nprices were likely to rise at a somewhat faster pace in 1998.\n\nThe members agreed that the risks to their price forecasts\nwere in the direction of higher inflation, given already high levels\nof capacity use and their expectations of appreciable further economic\ngrowth. Nonetheless, the relatively low inflation experienced despite\na lengthy period of fully employed resources suggested that the timing\nof a potential upturn in inflation--indeed whether inflation would in\nfact pick up--could not be predicted with any degree of confidence on\nthe basis of past historical patterns. The reasons for the persistence\nof a relatively benign inflation performance in the current\nexpansion were not fully understood. They included some temporary\nfactors such as the effect of the rise in the dollar on import prices\nand the restraint on health care costs. More fundamentally, they\npresumably also involved the favorable effects on production costs of\nwidespread business restructurings and the large volume of investment\nin more productive technology in recent years, the impact of both\nfactors on the job security concerns of workers and their willingness\nto accept reduced increases in compensation, and the effects of an\nintense degree of competition among domestic and foreign producers in\nU.S. markets. With regard to the possibility that more robust\nproductivity increases would be holding down production costs, it was\nnoted that a surge in economic activity, such as had occurred in late\n1996 and early 1997, tended to be accompanied by above-trend gains in\nproductivity. A slower pace of economic growth in the second quarter\nand beyond might provide an opportunity to assess whether productivity\nincreases were on a clear uptrend and could help to explain the\nfavorable behavior of prices over an extended period. In any event,\nit was too early to reach any firm conclusion on this issue or the\nbroader question of whether or when a rise in inflation might\nmaterialize under anticipated economic conditions.\n\nThe members also discussed a staff study of the relative\nperformance of various prices indices as measures of inflation.\nMembers noted that most broad measures of inflation moved together\nover extended periods of time, but they did not always do so over\nshort intervals. Differences in construction, coverage, and other\nfactors meant that none of the individual measures was clearly\nsuperior in assessing general inflation trends, and several members\ncommented that all measures needed to be monitored.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in February for 1997 and it\ndecided on tentative ranges for those aggregates for 1998. The\ncurrent ranges set in February for the period from the fourth quarter\nof 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997 were unchanged from the ranges\nfor 1996 and included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6\npercent for M3. An unchanged range of 3 to 7 percent also was set in\nJanuary for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1997.\n\nAll the members favored retaining the current ranges for this\nyear and extending them on a provisional basis to 1998. They\nanticipated that growth of M2 probably would continue at rates in the\nupper part of its current range in both years and that of M3 at rates\napproximating or even slightly above the upper bound of its range,\ngiven the Committee's expectations for the performance of the economy\nand prices. The current ranges were not expected to be guides to\nmoney growth under anticipated conditions in the period ahead, but\ninstead could be viewed as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that\nwould be associated with approximate price stability and sustained\neconomic growth, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical\nexperience. Accordingly, a reaffirmation of those ranges would\nunderscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price\nstability over time, and in the view of at least some members, higher\nranges could raise questions in this regard.\n\nOver the last few years, in contrast to earlier in the 1990s,\nthe behavior of the broad aggregates, especially that of M2, in\nrelation to nominal GDP and short-term interest rates had displayed a\npattern that was in line with historical norms prior to the 1990s.\nThe members viewed this as an encouraging development in that it\nraised the possibility of giving more weight at some point to the\nperformance of these aggregates as useful indicators in formulating\nmonetary policy. However, the period of more predictable M2 and M3\nbehavior was still relatively brief and such behavior had occurred at\na time of generally settled conditions in financial markets and the\noverall economy. The prospective performance of these aggregates in\nperiods of rapid changes in financial and economic conditions was\nstill an open question, and in light of the uncertainties that were\ninvolved the members concluded that it would be premature to place\nincreased reliance on them in the conduct of policy. Accordingly, the\nCommittee decided that despite projected growth of M2 and M3 at rates\nin the vicinity of the upper limits of the current ranges, prevailing\nuncertainties made it desirable to retain those ranges as benchmarks\nfor the achievement of price stability rather than to establish higher\nranges that seemed more likely to capture expected outcomes. In the\ncircumstances, any tendency for growth of the monetary aggregates to\nmove outside the Committee's ranges would not in itself call for a\npolicy adjustment but would continue to be interpreted in the context\nof a broad range of business and financial developments bearing on the\nprospective performance of the overall economy.\n\nThe Committee members were unanimously in favor of retaining\nthe current range of 3 to 7 percent for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt in 1997 and extending that range on a provisional\nbasis to 1998. They took account of a staff projection indicating\nthat growth of the debt aggregate was likely to slow somewhat from its\npace in 1995 and 1996, reflecting a small reduction in the expansion\nof federal government debt. According to the staff projection, growth\nin the debt measure would be near the midpoint of the existing range\nover the period through 1998.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to\nreaffirm the ranges for growth of M2, M3 and total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt that it had established in February for 1997. For the year\n1998, the Committee approved provisional ranges for the three\naggregates that were unchanged from the 1997 ranges. In keeping with\nits usual procedure under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee\nwould review its preliminary ranges for 1998 early next year, or\nsooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of their growth and\nvelocity behavior and ongoing economic and financial developments.\nAccordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following\nstatement regarding the 1997 and 1998 ranges in its domestic policy\ndirective:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow,\nParry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nNone.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to\nmaintain an unchanged policy stance, and they strongly supported the\nretention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged policy seemed\nappropriate with inflation still quiescent and business activity\nprojected to settle into a pattern of moderate growth broadly\nconsistent with the economy's long-run output potential. While the\nmembers assessed risks surrounding such a forecast as decidedly tilted\nto the upside, the slowing of the expansion should keep resource\nutilization from rising substantially further, and this outlook\ntogether with the absence of significant early signs of rising\ninflationary pressures suggested the desirability of a cautious \"wait\nand see\" policy stance at this point. In the current uncertain\nenvironment, this would afford the Committee an opportunity to gauge\nthe momentum of the expansion and the related degree of pressure on\nresources and prices. The risks of waiting appeared to be limited,\ngiven that the evidence at hand did not point to a step-up in\ninflation despite low unemployment and that the current stance of\nmonetary policy did not seem to be overly accommodative, at least on\nthe basis of some measures such as the level of real short-term\ninterest rates. In these circumstances, any tendency for price\npressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be\nreversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. Some\nmembers commented, however, that in the absence of unanticipated\nweakness in the economy, some tightening of policy was likely to be\nneeded in the relatively near future, and one expressed the view that\na tightening action at this meeting seemed desirable to forestall or\nlimit the risks of intensifying inflationary pressures. However,\nwaiting was an acceptable alternative given the favorable economic\nnews and the persisting uncertainties surrounding the relationship of\noutput to prices.\n\nIn their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they wanted to\nretain the existing asymmetry toward restraint adopted at the May\nmeeting. An asymmetric directive was consistent with their view that\nthe risks clearly were in the direction of excessive demand pressures\nin the economy and an associated upward trend in inflation. Such a\nbias in the directive also would serve the purpose of signaling the\nCommittee's ongoing commitment to curb inflation in the interest of\nfostering maximum sustainable economic growth and employment. The\nmembers agreed that the current environment called for careful\nmonitoring of developments and for prompt action by the Committee if\nneeded to counter rising inflation. Indeed, in the interest of\nfostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it\nwould be desirable to tighten on the basis of early signs of\npotentially intensifying inflation and before higher inflation\nactually materialized.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they could support a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat retained a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate expansion in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow,\nParry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nMarket interest rates generally have declined\nsomewhat since the day before the Committee meeting on\nMay 20, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen\nconsiderably further. In foreign exchange markets, the\ntrade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies was up slightly on balance over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 fluctuated sharply from April to\nMay in association with a swing in household balances\nrelated to large tax payments; on balance, both aggregates\nexpanded at a moderate pace over the two months,\nand available data pointed to further moderate growth in\nJune. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate\nnear the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at\na rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand\nin recent months and is near the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this\nmeeting the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on\ntentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, of\n1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The\nCommittee provisionally set the associated range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7\npercent for 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of\nprogress toward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period.
