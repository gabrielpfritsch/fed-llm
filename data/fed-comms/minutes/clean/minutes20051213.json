There were no open\nmarket operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the\nperiod since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nsince the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy\ncontinued to expand at a solid rate in the fourth quarter. Industrial\nproduction rebounded, and employment growth appeared to have recovered\nsmartly from the depressing effects of recent hurricanes. Although some\nscattered signs of cooling of the housing sector had emerged, the pace\nof construction activity and sales remained brisk. More broadly, spending\nby consumers and businesses was well maintained. Core consumer price inflation\nremained subdued, even though some of the increase in energy costs had\napparently passed through to prices of final goods and services.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in November after a small gain\nin October. Construction employment posted another large increase, probably\nowing in part to hurricane-related activity. Broad-based gains in durable\ngoods industries augmented manufacturing employment, and employment in\nthe related industries of temporary help services and wholesale trade\nincreased as well. With employment rising but the average workweek of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers falling slightly, aggregate hours\nslipped in November--albeit to a level above that of their third-quarter\naverage. The unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent, and the labor\nforce participation rate was also unchanged. Survey measures of individuals'\nexpectations of future labor market conditions improved in November, largely\nreversing post-Katrina declines.\n\nIndustrial production rebounded in October after having been held down\nin September by hurricanes and by a strike at Boeing. The resumption of\ncommercial aircraft production boosted manufacturing output and more than\noffset a fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Large output\ngains in hurricane-affected industries--such as segments of the food,\nrubber and plastics, and paper industries--also contributed to the\nincrease in manufacturing output. The growth of high-tech output slowed\nslightly in October, mainly as a result of smaller increases in the production\nof semiconductors. In contrast, production of communication equipment--particularly\ndata networking equipment--accelerated. With many energy facilities\nin the Gulf region still closed, output at mines, which is defined to\ninclude oil and gas extraction, slipped further in October. Manufacturing\ncapacity utilization moved up again in October and was only a touch below\nits long-run average.\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing solidly\nover the course of the fourth quarter, led by improvements in the fundamental\ndeterminants of consumer spending. Real disposable personal income was\nbolstered by gains in employment and falling retail energy prices, while\ncontinued brisk advances in house prices and the recent strengthening\nof equity prices contributed importantly to increases in household wealth.\nConsumer sentiment picked up in November and early December; some survey\nmeasures of confidence returned to the range seen during the first half\nof the year. The personal saving rate--while still slightly negative--moved\nup in October.\n\nActivity in the housing market remained brisk despite a rise in mortgage\ninterest rates. Starts of new single-family homes dropped back somewhat\nin October from September's very strong pace, but permit issuance\nremained elevated. New home sales reached a new high in October, and existing\nhome sales eased off only a little from the high levels recorded during\nthe summer. Other available indicators of housing activity were on the\nsoft side: An index of mortgage applications for purchases of homes declined\nin November, and builders' ratings of new home sales had fallen\noff in recent months. In addition, survey measures of homebuying attitudes\nhad declined to levels last observed in the early 1990s.\n\nReal outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the third\nquarter. Although business purchases of motor vehicles declined in October\nand November, growth in investment in nontransportation equipment appeared\nto have been well maintained in the fourth quarter. Rising business sales,\na declining cost of capital, and ample financial resources in the corporate\nsector continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending,\na sentiment echoed in executive surveys, which generally pointed to widespread\nincreases in planned capital outlays. Real spending on nonresidential\nconstruction improved materially in the third quarter, boosted by substantial\ngains in drilling and mining expenditures.\n\nReal nonfarm inventories ran off in the third quarter as automakers\npared their motor vehicle stocks. But even outside the motor vehicle sector,\ninventory investment was relatively restrained, and partial data for October\nsuggested that real stockbuilding continued to be subdued. The level of\nstocks appeared reasonably well aligned with sales.\n\nThe U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in September.\nA surge in imports was accompanied by a fairly sizable drop in exports,\npart of which was due to a steep falloff in aircraft exports as a result\nof the strike at Boeing. The jump in the value of imports was driven by\nstrong growth in most categories of goods and, to a lesser extent, growth\nin services; increases in the dollar value of imports of oil and of industrial\nsupplies--especially natural gas--were particularly strong,\na reflection of higher prices. Foreign industrialized economies expanded\nrobustly in the third quarter, and available indicators for the fourth\nquarter appeared promising, on balance.\n\nCore consumer price inflation was moderate in recent months, although\nsome signs of pass-through of higher energy costs were evident, especially\nin transportation services. Consumer energy prices had retreated notably\nfrom their elevated post-hurricane levels. Wholesale and retail gasoline\nprices dropped as gasoline inventories rebounded. And spot prices for\nnatural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate\nweather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels;\nunusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices\nto move back up to their October levels. Presumably in response to falling\nretail energy prices, one survey of households in November and early December\nshowed a marked retreat in expectations for inflation over the coming\nyear. Longer-term inflation expectations also edged down, but stayed a\ntouch above the narrow range observed in recent years. Although recent\nincreases in energy costs had pushed up producer prices in some sectors,\noverall producer price inflation remained subdued. With regard to labor\ncosts, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private\nindustry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase. Hourly\ncompensation in the nonfarm business sector also appeared to have slowed\na bit recently.\n\nAt its November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to\nincrease the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to\n4 percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that,\nwith appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks\nto the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be\nkept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that elevated energy prices\nand hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity had temporarily\ndepressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation,\ncoupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing\nsupport to economic activity. And although the cumulative rise in energy\nand other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressures, core\ninflation had been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remained contained. In these circumstances, the Committee\nbelieved that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was\nlikely to be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic\nprospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\n\nMarket participants widely anticipated the Committee's decision\nat its November meeting, and the policy announcement evoked little reaction\nin financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked up\nslightly their expectations for the path of monetary policy in light of\nstronger-than-expected data on spending and production. Nominal Treasury\nyields changed little, on net, but measures of inflation compensation\nat longer horizons--which are calculated using yields on nominal\nand inflation-protected securities--declined somewhat. Credit spreads\non both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged\nover the intermeeting period. Major equity price indexes posted substantial\ngains, spurred by the perception that the economy had retained considerable\nmomentum with limited inflation pressures. In foreign exchange markets,\nthe trade-weighted value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nThe expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated\na little from its brisk third-quarter pace. Consumer credit dipped in\nOctober, and nonfinancial firms' net borrowing in the form of bank\nloans, commercial paper, and bonds was a bit below the third-quarter pace.\nHousehold bankruptcies hovered at very low levels in recent weeks after\nsoaring to unprecedented heights just before the implementation of more-stringent\nbankruptcy rules in mid-October. Hurricane relief payments apparently\nboosted M2 in October, but that aggregate decelerated in November, partly\nreflecting the continued rise in the opportunity cost of holding liquid\ndeposits.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of\neconomic activity would slow from this year's pace, but remain solid,\nwith output staying near the economy's potential over the next two\nyears. Although hurricane-related rebuilding would boost activity, especially\nin the near term, this stimulus increasingly would be countered by higher\ninterest rates, the anticipated waning of the positive wealth effect associated\nwith large earlier gains in equity and house prices, and reduced impetus\nfrom fiscal policy. Both overall and core consumer price inflation were\nprojected to move higher in the first half of next year, reflecting the\neffects of higher energy prices, but then to trend lower as those effects\nebb.\n\nIn their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants\nnoted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been encouraging\nwith regard to both economic growth and inflation. The economic expansion\nhad shown considerable resilience in the face of higher energy prices\nand hurricane-related disruptions, suggesting greater underlying strength\nthan had been apparent at the time of the November meeting. At the same\ntime, incoming inflation data had been benign, indicating relatively modest\npass-through of higher energy prices to core inflation to date; subdued\ngains in compensation and strong growth in productivity were holding down\nbusiness costs; and inflation expectations, which had jumped after the\nhurricanes, had fallen back. Nonetheless, with growth solid and prices\nof energy products still well above levels earlier in the year, possible\nincreases in resource utilization had the potential to add to pressures\non prices, especially in the absence of some further firming of policy.\n\nIn their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants\nnoted that, while light vehicle sales had slowed in the fall, consumer\nspending outside the auto sector appeared to have remained vigorous. Holiday\nsales were said to be off to a good start in many parts of the country.\nThe substantial recovery in measures of consumer confidence after their\nsharp declines in the aftermath of the hurricanes had reduced meeting\nparticipants' concerns about a significant pull-back in spending.\nGoing forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further\nadvances in employment and income.\n\nMeeting participants discussed tentative signs that activity was beginning\nto slow in the housing sector. Reports from contacts in many parts of\nthe country suggested somewhat less ebullient market conditions, and measures\nof confidence of homebuyers and builders had fallen back noticeably. A\ndownshift in attitudes regarding the outlook for the housing sector could\nhave significant market effects, in part by damping the demand for houses\nby investors and speculators. A slowing of house price increases, by restraining\nthe expansion of consumption, and a moderation in the pace of new building\nwere expected to reduce the growth of aggregate demand somewhat in coming\nquarters. To date, however, the national data on home prices, sales, and\nconstruction activity did not suggest a significant weakening in the sector.\n\nBusiness investment spending had accelerated some since midyear. In\npart, the pickup may have reflected an increase in business confidence\nas the economy proved resilient in the face of this year's substantial\nadverse shocks. Participants noted that the improved performance of investment\nsuggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening\nbusiness spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth\nof household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.\n\nEconomic activity also could be buoyed by developments in other sectors\nof the economy. Increased federal government outlays were expected to\nboost output a little next year. Supportive financial conditions and an\napparent increase in confidence had contributed to a pickup in growth\nabroad. Despite possible firming of monetary policy by some foreign central\nbanks and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar owing to\nglobal demands for dollar assets, a good portion of the recent strength\nin foreign economic growth was expected to persist and provide support\nfor U.S. exports.\n\nIn their discussion of prices, participants indicated that their concerns\nabout near-term inflation pressures had eased somewhat over the intermeeting\nperiod. Recent data suggested that, thus far, indirect effects of elevated\nenergy prices on core inflation had been muted. Moreover, energy prices\ngenerally had fallen back on balance since earlier in the fall, and much\nof the increases in inflation expectations posted in the aftermath of\nthe hurricanes had reversed. Participants noted that robust competition--including\nthat from foreign producers--and further substantial gains in productivity\nwere helping to contain cost and price pressures. Moreover, measures of\nlabor compensation showed only moderate gains while relatively wide profit\nmargins could allow firms to absorb somewhat larger increases in labor\nand other costs without boosting prices. Nonetheless, surveys and anecdotal\nreports suggested that some firms were successfully passing at least a\nportion of their increased costs on to customers, and many participants\nremained concerned that elevated energy prices could put pressure on core\ninflation. Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy\nwas possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent\nstrength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten\nfurther and inflation pressures build. Under these circumstances, and\nwith policy having been accommodative for some time, inflation expectations\ncould rise if monetary policy were not seen as responding to contain such\nrisks.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting\nperiod, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis\npoints to 4-1/4 percent. With spending apparently retaining considerable\nmomentum, and with the indirect effects of increased energy prices still\nthreatening to raise core inflation at least for a time, the Committee\nthought that additional policy firming at this meeting was appropriate\nto keep inflation and inflation expectations in check. Committee members\ngenerally anticipated that policy would likely need to be firmed further\ngoing forward. In that process, the Committee would need to be mindful\nof the lags in the effect of policy firming on the economy. However, it\nwould also have to take account of the effects of the sustained period\nof favorable financial conditions on asset prices and aggregate demand\nas well as the resulting possibility of further increases in resource\nutilization and pressures on prices. Views differed on how much further\ntightening might be required. Because the Committee's actions over\nthe past eighteen months had significantly reduced the degree of monetary\npolicy accommodation, members thought that the policy outlook was becoming\nconsiderably less certain and that policy decisions going forward would\ndepend to an increased extent on the implications of incoming economic\ndata for future growth and inflation.\n\nThe Committee agreed that several changes in the wording of the announcement\nto be released after today's meeting would be appropriate. The federal\nfunds rate had been boosted substantially, and, in the view of some members,\nit was now likely within a broad range of values that might turn out to\nbe consistent with output remaining close to potential. In these circumstances,\nthe Committee thought that policy should no longer be characterized as\naccommodative. Members concurred that the statement should note that the\nexpansion remained solid despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related\ndisruptions. While inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained\ncontained, the Committee agreed that the announcement should indicate\nthat possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy\nprices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures and that \"some\nfurther measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks\nto the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability\nroughly in balance.\" Although future action would depend on the\nincoming data, this characterization of the outlook for policy was seen\nby most members as indicating that, given the information now in hand,\nthe number of additional firming steps required probably would not be\nlarge. Some members thought that the word \"measured\" was no\nlonger necessary, but its retention for this meeting was seen as potentially\nuseful to preclude a possible misinterpretation that the Committee now\nsaw a significant possibility of adjusting policy in larger increments\nin the near future. Wording of the announcement along these lines was\nnot expected to have a substantial effect on market expectations for policy,\nthough such effects were especially difficult to judge given the extensive\nchanges being made to the statement. The members agreed that the announcement\nshould end by noting that policy will respond to changes in economic prospects\nas needed to foster the Committee's objectives.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,\nto execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nThe vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in\nthe statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs.\nFerguson, Fisher, Kohn, Olson, Moskow, Santomero, and Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nTuesday, January 31, 2006.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m.\n\nNotation Vote By notation vote completed on November 21, 2005, the Committee unanimously\napproved the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee\nheld on November 1, 2005."
