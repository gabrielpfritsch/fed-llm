Attended portion of meeting relating to discussion of merging\nminutes of action and policy record into one document.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, the subcommittee established to\nreview policies relating to the release of Committee information\nreported on its further deliberations and proposed a merging of the\ncurrent \"Minutes of Actions\" and the \"Record of Policy Actions\" into a\nnew document to be designated \"Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee Meeting.\" Merging the two documents would put in convenient\nform all the information that is released pertaining to FOMC meetings,\nand the new document would be made public on the same schedule as its\npredecessor documents. The Committee members endorsed the subcommittee's proposal and by unanimous vote the Committee approved the\n\"Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting\" held on\nFebruary 2-3, 1993; this merged document was scheduled to be released\non March 26, 1993.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets since the previous meeting on\nFebruary 2-3, 1993. There were no System open market transactions in\nforeign currencies during this intermeeting period, and thus no vote\nwas required of the Committee.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations reported on\ndevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market\ntransactions in government securities and federal agency obligations\nduring the period February 3, 1993, through March 22, 1993. By\nunanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the inter-meeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding at a more moderate pace in the early\nmonths of 1993 after increasing substantially in the fourth quarter.\nAlthough outlays for business equipment apparently remained on a\nstrong upward trajectory, sales of new homes had slackened and\nconsumer spending was rising less rapidly. Indicators of production\nactivity also were mixed: Industrial output had continued to post\nsolid gains, but homebuilding had been less robust since year-end.\nPayroll employment had strengthened, and the unemployment rate had\nmoved down further. Increases in wages had remained subdued in recent\nmonths, but advances in consumer and producer prices had been larger\nthan those recorded in the latter part of 1992.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in February,\nfollowing generally small advances in previous months, and the length\nof the average workweek remained at the fourth-quarter level. The\nstrong job gains in construction, services, and retail trade in\nFebruary apparently reflected to some extent a partial reversal of the\nspecial factors that had depressed reported employment in these\nsectors in previous months. Since December, initial claims for\nunemployment insurance had fluctuated in a range that was consistent\nwith further modest growth in employment. The civilian unemployment\nrate edged lower again in February, to 7.0 percent.\n\nIndustrial production continued to rise at a fairly brisk\npace in January and February. Changes in mining and utilities were\nabout offsetting on balance over the two months, but increases in\nmanufacturing were fairly widespread. Although motor vehicle assemblies fell in February from a relatively high January level, the\nproduction of consumer durables and computers turned up sharply.\nIn addition, increases in output were recorded in several other\ncategories, including non-energy materials and construction supplies.\nRecent surveys indicated that new orders for durable goods increased\nfurther in February, and lean factory inventories coupled with reports\nof lengthening delivery times suggested further gains in industrial\noutput in coming months. Total utilization of industrial capacity\nrose again in February.\n\nRetail sales advanced in February after a fourth-quarter\nsurge and a pause in January. Sales at automotive dealers weakened in\nFebruary. However, there were sharp increases in sales of building\nmaterials and supplies, miscellaneous durable goods, and nondurable\ngoods other than apparel. After registering sizable gains late last\nyear, housing starts fell substantially in January and retraced only\npart of that decline in February. The slowdown was concentrated in\nsingle-family housing starts; multifamily starts were up in February\nfrom a historically low level in January. Although mortgage interest\nrates had dropped to the lowest levels in decades, sales of both new\nand existing homes turned down in January from their high December\nlevels.\n\nIncoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital\ngoods suggested a further brisk advance in outlays for business\nequipment in coming months. In January, a decline in shipments of\nnondefense capital goods only partially reversed a large December\nrise, as a surge in shipments of computing equipment helped sustain\nthe overall level. Shipments of complete civilian aircraft posted a\nsolid gain in January. The increase appeared to be concentrated in\nsales to foreign purchasers; in the domestic airline industry, intense\ncompetition was forcing cutbacks of unprofitable routes and reductions\nin both the number of planes in service and orders for new planes.\nShipments of durable equipment other than computers and aircraft fell\nin January to about the level of the fourth quarter. On the other\nhand, the January reading on new orders for these goods was well above\nthe average for the fourth quarter, suggesting that additional\nadvances in shipments might lie ahead. Nonresidential construction\nactivity was down slightly further in January, reflecting persisting\ndeclines in office and industrial building in an environment of excess\nsupply and some continuing, though perhaps lessening, downward\npressure on the prices of such structures.\n\nBusiness inventories appeared to have edged lower in January.\nIn manufacturing, factory stocks were drawn down further, and most\nindustries had relatively low stocks-to-shipments ratios. Among\nwholesalers, strong January sales pulled down inventories at many\ntypes of establishments; in numerous cases, a large accumulation of\nstocks in the fourth quarter was reversed. For the wholesale sector\nas a whole, the inventories-to-sales ratio in January was near the\nbottom of the range of the past two years. Retail inventories rose\nsomewhat further in January after a large December increase. Stocks\nat automotive dealers accounted for all of the January accumulation.\nAt retail stores other than auto dealers, the ratio of inventories-to-sales remained within the narrow range observed over the past year.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly\nin January but was little changed from its average level in the fourth\nquarter. The value of both exports and imports dropped sharply in\nJanuary from the December levels. The decline in imports was spread\nwidely among major trade categories, but the decrease in exports\nlargely reflected a reduction in shipments of aircraft after a strong\nDecember rise. Among the major foreign industrialized countries, the\nlevel of real activity contracted further in the fourth quarter in\nJapan, western Germany, and France; for the first quarter, the limited\ndata available were generally weak for Japan and France but somewhat\nmore mixed for western Germany. By contrast, economic activity\nappeared to be increasing in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods were up in January and\nFebruary after changing little over the fourth quarter. Producer\nprices of finished foods declined over the first two months of the\nyear, but prices of finished energy products climbed rapidly, and\nprices of other finished items rose at a faster rate than in 1992. At\nthe consumer level, price increases in January and February also were\non the high side of the past year's advances. Food prices jumped in\nJanuary and rose slightly further in February, while energy prices\nretraced most of a sharp January rise. Excluding food and energy\nitems, consumer prices advanced at a substantially faster pace over\nthe January-February period than in 1992. Increases in wages, as\nmeasured by average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory\nworkers, remained subdued in recent months. The advance in average\nhourly earnings slowed in February, and the rise over the twelve\nmonths ended in February was considerably smaller than over the\nprevious twelve-month period.\n\nAt its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nlittle change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period\nfrom January through March.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged only slightly\nabove expected levels in the three full reserve maintenance periods in\nthe intermeeting interval. For the period as a whole, the federal\nfunds rate remained close to the 3 percent level that had prevailed in\nprevious months.\n\nOther short-term interest rates changed little over the\nintermeeting period, while long-term rates fell appreciably on\nbalance. Bond markets rallied over most of the period, reflecting\nmarket assessments of improved prospects for significant reductions in\nthe federal budget deficit in coming years and the consequences for\noverall spending. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds also were\nboosted by municipal defeasance activity and by perceptions of\nheightened prepayment risks in mortgage-backed securities. In early\nMarch, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and conventional\nfixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest levels since 1973, but some\nof the decline in bond and mortgage rates subsequently was reversed in\nresponse to increased apprehension about inflation. Equity prices\ngenerally responded favorably to the drop in long-term interest rates,\nbut concerns about future changes in government policy toward a number\nof industries, including health care, led to lower prices in some\nsegments of the equities market.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell on balance over the\nintermeeting period. The dollar depreciated through late February,\npartly in response to declines in U.S. long-term interest rates and\nincoming data that were seen as pointing to some slowing of the\nexpansion in the United States. Subsequently, the dollar rebounded in\nthe wake of unexpectedly strong U.S. employment statistics, disappointing inflation numbers, and further signs of weakening economic\nactivity abroad. Near the end of the period, the dollar again dropped\nagainst the German mark and other European currencies, following a cut\nby the Bundesbank of its discount rate that apparently was less than\nmarket participants were expecting. On balance over the period, the\ndollar was marginally lower against the mark and other European\ncurrencies, but it declined substantially against the Japanese yen,\nreaching an all-time low.\n\nM2 and M3 contracted in January and February. Part of the\nweakness apparently reflected temporary factors, such as distortions\nin seasonal adjustment factors and a lull in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities that reduced deposits held in association with this\nactivity. More fundamentally, relatively attractive returns on\ncapital market instruments continued to prompt households to shift\nlarge amounts of liquid balances into market investments, such as bond\nand stock mutual fund shares. In addition, banks continued to issue\nsubordinated debt and equity to improve their balance sheets at a\ntime when the expansion of bank credit was slowing noticeably; in\nparticular, bank lending to businesses had been depressed by paydowns\nfrom the proceeds of heavy bond and stock issuance by nonfinancial\ncorporations. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have\nexpanded somewhat further in January.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity would grow over the year ahead at a pace that would\nfoster a further gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor and\ncapital. The projection incorporated the essential elements of the\nfiscal proposals recently set forth by the Administration; the effects\non aggregate demand, all other things equal, were expected to be small\nover the next several quarters. However, the appreciable declines in\nlong-term interest rates that had occurred in recent months--evidently\npartly in response to anticipations of intermediate-term deficit\nreduction--were expected to support substantial additional gains in\nbusiness and residential investment. Consumer spending would be\nbolstered by the progress already achieved in reducing debt service\nburdens and by a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security,\nalthough the higher personal income taxes now envisioned for upper-income taxpayers were expected to be an inhibiting factor. Increases\nin export demand would be limited in the near term by the continuing\nweakness in the economies of the major industrialized countries. The\npersisting slack in resource utilization was expected to be associated\nwith a return to more subdued price increases after a spurt earlier\nthis year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, the members remained encouraged by recent\ndevelopments that they viewed on the whole as tending to confirm their\nforecasts of sustained economic expansion, though at a pace appreciably below that now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1992. If\nrealized, such economic growth would be associated over time with a\nfurther gradual decline in unemployment. While the expansion appeared\nto have generated some momentum, a number of factors were likely to\nlimit its strength, including ongoing balance sheet and business\nrestructuring activities, the outlook for a more restrictive federal\nbudget, and continuing weakness in key foreign markets. At the same\ntime, greatly reduced interest rates and much improved, if still\nvulnerable, business and consumer confidence were positive factors in\nthe outlook. Some members cautioned that even though a moderate rate\nof economic growth could be viewed as the most likely outcome over the\nforecast horizon, the current expansion differed in important respects\nfrom earlier cyclical recoveries and in light of the attendant\nuncertainties a considerably different result--in either direction--could not be ruled out. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the\nfaster increases in consumer prices in recent months and a sharp\nupturn in the prices of certain producer materials tended to raise\nconcerns, or at least a degree of unease, with regard to underlying\ninflation trends. While these developments might well prove to be an\naberration rather than a signal of intensifying inflation, they did\nsuggest the need to reassess the likelihood of a further decline in\ninflation and to be alert to further signs of a sustained upturn. For\nnow, however, the favorable trends in underlying unit labor costs,\nwhich were associated in turn with ongoing gains in productivity and\nthe absence of any firming in wage pressures, led many members to\nconclude that recent price developments did not provide persuasive\nevidence of a change in the inflation outlook.\n\nMembers continued to report somewhat uneven business conditions across the nation. Steady economic growth characterized many\nparts of the country, but business activity remained depressed in some\nareas and industries, notably those related to defense, aerospace, and\nnonresidential construction. While business sentiment was generally\npositive, many business contacts were uncertain about the outlook for\ndemand in their own industries or the potential strength of the\noverall expansion, and recent fiscal policy developments appeared to\nhave introduced a further note of caution. This uncertainty helped to\naccount for the continuing reliance of numerous firms on overtime work\nto meet growing demand rather than incurring the considerable costs of\nadding new workers. Even so, an increasing number of contacts were\nreporting worker recalls or new hires. One member commented that job\ngrowth could be viewed both as a measure of business sentiment and as\na necessary element in building or maintaining consumer confidence and\nthus helping to ensure an enduring economic expansion.\n\nThe quickening recovery during 1992, especially in the second\nhalf of the year, had received considerable impetus from consumer\nspending, and while growth in such spending could be expected to\nmoderate from its pace in recent quarters, the consumer sector was\nviewed as likely to play a key role in sustaining the expansion this\nyear. Many consumers had taken advantage of steep declines in\ninterest rates to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce their\ndebt service burdens, and they were now in a much improved position to\nfinance further growth in their expenditures. The members took note\nof recent indications of a decline in consumer confidence and of some\nsoftening in retail sales since early in the year. However, the\nlatter appeared to be in part the result of recently adverse weather\nconditions in some major parts of the country, and consumer confidence\nwas still much improved on balance since earlier in the recovery.\nAccordingly, recent developments were not seen in themselves as\nharbingers of a weakening consumer spending trend over the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nBusiness spending on producers' durable equipment also was\nbelieved likely to continue to provide appreciable stimulus to the\nexpansion assuming that the much reduced interest rates and currently\nfavorable business attitudes would be sustained and that proposed\ninvestment tax credit legislation eventually would be enacted. At the\nsame time, business spending for nonresidential structures probably\nwould continue to be held back by weakness in office construction\nstemming from widespread overcapacity. While office building activity\nwas likely to be restrained for an extended period, members saw some\npositive signs that pointed to a degree of stabilization in this\nsector, including the leveling out or even a marginal pickup in rents\nand occupancy rates in some markets that previously had been severely\ndepressed. A slow turnaround in other building activity was reported\nin some regions, notably for industrial and retail structures.\n\nWhile the available data on starts of single-family houses\nin January and February were somewhat disappointing, the members felt\nthat housing construction activity had held up relatively well thus\nfar this year, after allowing for the adverse weather conditions that\nhad retarded construction in some areas. The greatly reduced cost of\nmortgage financing pointed to continuing gains in housing construction\ndespite a rise in costs associated with the sharp jump in lumber\nprices and a scarcity of finished building lots in some areas.\n\nThe members agreed that the prospects for overall spending on\nbusiness capital goods and housing were vulnerable to shifts in\nattitudes that might be triggered, for example, by increases in market\ninterest rates associated with an absence of progress in reducing the\nfederal budget deficit. The outlook for a significant contraction in\nthe federal deficit was subject to considerable uncertainty,\nespecially in light of the still pending decisions to be made with\nregard to health care programs and their financing. The members\nrecognized that the direct effects of appreciable deficit reduction\nwould tend to constrain economic activity, as evidenced by the impact\nin many areas of the defense cutbacks that were already being\nimplemented. Business contacts had expressed concerns about the\npotential effects on their industries and local markets of various\nprovisions in the proposed legislation. Even so, a more encompassing\nassessment of the effects of deficit reduction needed to take account\nof its favorable implications for domestic interest rates. Moreover,\ninsofar as the nearer-term outlook was concerned, the fiscal\nlegislation now under consideration included new spending initiatives\nand the investment tax credit that were intended to provide some\ntemporary stimulus to an economic expansion that, in the view of many\nobservers, might still be in the process of gathering sustainable\nmomentum. On balance, substantial deficit reduction in line with the\ncurrently proposed legislation was seen as likely to have a positive\neffect on business and consumer confidence, financial markets, and the\nlonger-term health of the economy.\n\nSeveral members observed that the outlook for exports had\nworsened as a result of weakening economic trends in a number of major\nindustrialized nations. Members also commented on the uncertainties\nin the outlook for foreign trade associated with a variety of\npolitical risks abroad and the persisting protectionism that currently\nwas highlighted by strong opposition to key trade agreements now under\nnegotiation or under consideration for ratification. Anecdotal\ninformation from business contacts involved in export markets\ncontinued to suggest lagging foreign demands for many U.S. goods;\nhowever, backlogs for other products, such as labor-saving capital\nequipment, remained sizable.\n\nThe members devoted considerable attention to the discussion\nof various factors underlying the outlook for inflation. The consumer\nand producer price indexes had been less favorable in January and\nFebruary than in the latter part of 1992. Also, prices of various\nindustrial and construction materials had firmed since the start of\nthe year in apparent response to rising production and, in some\nindustries, to import or environmental restrictions. Anecdotal\nreports of increasing costs and prices had begun to appear with\nsomewhat greater frequency in some areas, and pressures to widen\nprofit margins reportedly were strong in a number of industries. In\ntheir evaluation of recent inflation developments, however, the\nmembers generally gave more weight to the behavior of unit labor\ncosts, which indicated that much of the economy's underlying cost\nstructure did not reflect any signs of a pickup in inflationary\npressures. Moreover, from a financial perspective, extensions of\ncredit and growth in overall nonfinancial sector debt were not\nconsistent with an economy that was generating significant inflationary pressures, and the recent behavior of long-term debt markets\nsuggested expectations of more subdued inflation. Against this background, the recent upturn in consumer and certain commodity prices\nmight well represent a temporary development such as had occurred\npreviously during the current cyclical upswing. In support of this\nview, members cited various fundamentals that seemed inconsistent with\naccelerating inflation, including the considerable slack in the utilization of labor and capital resources, strong competitive conditions\nin many markets, the absence of significant lengthening in supplier\ndelivery schedules, and an extended period of weak expansion in the\nbroader monetary aggregates that now encompassed some recent deceleration in M1. Nonetheless, the members acknowledged that recent\nprice developments had raised a degree of unease in their minds, and\ntheir concerns would rise if the recent pace of price advances were\nsustained in the months immediately ahead. One member observed that a\nsomewhat faster economic expansion than currently was expected by most\nmembers might well serve to intensify inflation pressures. While\nprice developments were notably difficult to predict, most of the\nmembers concluded that the evidence at this point did not confirm a\nresurgence in inflationary pressures, and some commented that further\nmodest disinflation remained a reasonable expectation for the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, most of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions, while two members\nsupported an immediate move to tighten reserve conditions. In the\nmajority view, the current degree, of reserve pressure continued to\nrepresent a policy stance that was appropriately balanced in light of\nthe opposing risks of a faltering economic expansion and a resurgence\nof inflation. Conditions in credit markets did not provide confirming\nevidence of the emergence of greater inflationary pressures and the\nneed to restrain the growth in credit. Indeed, the continuation of\nbalance sheet restructuring activities by financial institutions and\nthe associated caution on the part of these institutions with regard\nto extending loans still appeared to be exerting a significantly\ninhibiting effect on the overall growth in spending and economic\nactivity. Several members acknowledged that a policy of maintaining\nunchanged reserve conditions and an associated federal funds rate\naround current levels, which implied that real short-term rates were\nnear zero or even slightly negative, could have inflationary\nconsequences in the event of a strengthening of the expansion and a\nsustained pickup in credit demands. The Committee would need to\nremain alert to such a development. In present circumstances,\nhowever, an unchanged policy stance seemed most consistent with\nachieving sustained economic expansion in an environment of subdued\ninflation. The members who favored a prompt move toward restraint\nwere persuaded that a steady policy incurred an unacceptable risk of\nhalting the progress toward price stability and indeed of intensifying\ninflation as the current expansion matured. In this view, a policy\ntightening move at this point was likely to counter the need for more\nsubstantial and potentially disruptive tightening actions later.\n\nIn the course of the Committee discussion, the members took\naccount of a staff analysis that pointed to a resumption of M2 and M3\ngrowth over the months ahead. This analysis suggested that the temporary factors depressing the broader monetary aggregates likely would\nbe reversing, but that the other influences causing a rechanneling of\ncredit flows away from depository institutions and boosting the\nvelocity of money undoubtedly would persist, though probably with\ndiminishing force. Accordingly, the staff foresaw moderate growth of\nM2 and M3 that at midyear would leave these aggregates below the lower\nends of the Committee's ranges for 1993. Under prevailing circumstances, such continuing weakness in the broader aggregates was not\nviewed as indicating inadequate monetary stimulus. Indeed, a number\nof members commented that other indicators suggested that current\nmonetary policy was in fact quite accommodative as evidenced for\nexample by low short-term interest rates, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis. Moreover, Ml, reserves, and the monetary base had\ncontinued to expand in the first quarter, though at much reduced\nrates. One member commented that the slowdown in these narrower\nmonetary measures, which he viewed as important indicators of the\nthrust of monetary policy, had favorable implications with regard to\nbringing inflation under control. The members agreed that the\nconsiderable uncertainty that continued to surround the outlook for\nbroad money relative to spending implied that forming precise expectations for monetary growth over the months ahead was not feasible.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting\nadjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, members who favored an\nunchanged policy stance also expressed a preference for retaining the\nsymmetry of the existing directive. Some observed that a policy\nchange during the intermeeting period, if any, might well be in the\ndirection of a tightening move. However, because there was no\ncompelling case in the view of most members for such a move at this\ntime and any intermeeting adjustment would be made in the light of\nemerging developments, a symmetric directive was warranted. In this\nconnection, one member commented that, given the Committee's assessment of current economic and financial conditions, a tilt in the\ndirective toward restraint would give a misleading indication of the\nCommittee's current intentions. Members also noted that a change in\npolicy, should one be called for by intermeeting developments, would\nrepresent a shift in the direction of policy and would be likely to\nhave an especially pronounced impact on financial markets.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, a majority\nof the members indicated that they favored a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.\nThese members also expressed a preference for a directive that did not\ninclude a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to\npolicy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nslightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with a\nresumption of moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the second quarter.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity has increased at a more moderate\npace in the early months of 1993 after expanding\nrobustly in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll\nemployment registered a sharp increase in February\nfollowing generally small advances in previous months,\nand the civilian unemployment rate edged down further\nto 7.0 percent. Industrial production continued to\npost solid gains in January and February. Retail sales\nincreased somewhat further over the first two months of\nthe year after a fourth-quarter surge. Housing starts\nslipped in early 1993 after registering sizable gains\nlate last year. Incoming data on orders and shipments\nof nondefense capital goods suggest a further brisk\nadvance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The\nnominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was essentially\nunchanged in January from its average level in the\nfourth quarter, but both exports and imports were substantially lower. Increases in wages have remained\nsubdued, but recent advances in consumer and producer\nprices have been larger than those recorded in the\nlatter part of 1992.\n\nShort-term interest rates have changed little\nsince the Committee meeting in early February while\nbond yields have fallen appreciably on balance. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies\ndeclined on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nM2 and M3 contracted in January and February,\napparently reflecting transitory factors and further\nshifts into market investments. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded somewhat\nfurther in January.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in February established ranges for growth of M2\nand M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992\nto the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects\nthat developments contributing to unusual velocity\nincreases are likely to persist during the year. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for\nthe year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will\ncontinue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith a resumption of moderate growth in the broader\nmonetary aggregates over the second quarter.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nCorrigan, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, McTeer,\nMullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Angell\nand Lindsey.\n\nMessrs. Angell and Lindsey indicated that their concerns about\nthe outlook for inflation prompted them to favor an immediate move to\ntighten reserve conditions. In their view, such an action was desirable\nnot only to arrest the possible emergence of greater inflation but\nespecially to promote further disinflation. They were persuaded that\nmonetary policy currently was overly accommodative as suggested by\nvarious indicators such as recent data on consumer and producer prices,\nthe upswing in commodity prices, the low level of real short-term\ninterest rates, and what in their judgment was a relatively depressed\nforeign exchange value of the dollar given the comparative strength of\nthe U.S. economy and international interest rate trends. They noted\nthat the current federal funds rate was probably not sustainable in the\nlong term and that a tightening move at this time might well avoid the\nneed for more sizable and potentially disruptive policy actions later.\n\nMr. Angell also emphasized the risks associated with any policy\nthat did not firmly maintain a disinflationary trend. As he interpreted\nhistorical precedents, the typical result of a policy that tolerated\nsome inflation was an eventual rise in inflation leading to permanently\nhigher interest rates with adverse effects on economic activity.\nIndeed, he supported unpegging the federal funds rate to counter\nincipient price pressures showing through in commodity and finished\ngoods prices. He believed that a clear signal of the Committee's\ncommitment to price level stability would stabilize the price of gold\nalong with the exchange value of the dollar and thereby provide a\nclimate for further reductions in long-and intermediate-term interest\nrates. Such an approach to policy not only would assure a continuing\ndisinflationary trend and eventual price stability, with very favorable\nimplications for financial markets and economic growth, but it would in\nhis view preclude an unsettling tendency for the debt markets to weaken\nevery time newly available data appeared to suggest that economic growth\nwas strengthening and that further monetary policy tightening actions\ntherefore might be in the offing. In sum, such a policy would provide\nfor the achievement of the Committee's objective of sustaining progress\ntoward price stability which he believed was necessary for maintaining\nrecent higher labor productivity, a permanently higher savings rate, and\na prolonged period of economic expansion.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, May 18, 1993.\n\nThe meeting adjourned.\n\nNormand Bernard Deputy Secretary\n\nFOMC"
