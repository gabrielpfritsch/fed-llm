Freeman to serve as associate economist of\nthe Committee until the selection of a successor at the first regularly\nscheduled meeting after December 31, 2005.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments\nin foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign\ncurrencies for the\nSystem's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager\nalso reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System\nopen market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations\nduring the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nAt this meeting the Committee reviewed and discussed staff presentations\non the topic of housing valuations and monetary policy. Prices of houses\nin the United States had risen sharply in recent years, especially in\ncertain areas of the country, to very high levels relative to incomes\nor rents. In addition to local market factors, a wide range of influences\nappeared to be supporting home prices, including solid gains in disposable\nincome, low mortgage rates, and financial innovation in the residential\nmortgage market. Prices might be somewhat above the levels consistent\nwith these underlying factors, but measuring the extent of any overvaluation\neither nationally or in regional markets posed considerable conceptual\nand statistical difficulties. Meeting participants noted that the rise\nin house prices had been accompanied by a modest shift toward potentially\nriskier types of mortgages, including adjustable-rate and interest-only\nloans, which could pose challenges to both lenders and borrowers. Nonetheless,\nfinancial institutions generally remained in a comfortable capital position,\nsuch loans had performed well thus far, much of the associated risk had\nbeen transferred to other investors through securitization, and valuations\nhad risen more rapidly than mortgage debt on average--so that loan-to-value\nratios had fallen.\n\nThe information received at this meeting suggested that the economy\nwas expanding at a moderate pace in the second quarter. Housing activity\nremained at a high level, business investment appeared to have improved\nsome after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter, and manufacturing\npicked up notably in May. Supported by a rebound in motor vehicle purchases,\nconsumer spending appeared on track to post another moderate gain for\nthe quarter. Labor demand continued to expand, and the unemployment rate\nedged down further in May. Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May,\nbut crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in\nthe spring.\n\nAveraging through a large gain in April and a more modest increase in\nMay, growth in payroll employment was on par with that over the preceding\nsix months. Payrolls expanded in line with their recent trends in the\nconstruction, transportation and utilities, and nonbusiness services sectors,\nwhile hiring in financial services slowed a bit, and the manufacturing\nsector posted further small losses of jobs. The average workweek of production\nor nonsupervisory workers edged up over the two-month period, helping\nto boost aggregate hours to the highest level since early 2001. The unemployment\nrate dipped to 5.1 percent in May. Meanwhile, the labor force participation\nrate moved up a bit, suggesting that the labor market had strengthened\nenough to attract some individuals back into the workforce. Survey indicators\nand the continued relatively low level of initial claims for unemployment\ninsurance also supported the notion of continued improvement in the labor\nmarket.\n\nIndustrial production declined in April, owing to a dip in utilities\noutput, but widespread gains in manufacturing output in May offset that\nloss. On net, industrial production was little changed over April and\nMay; capacity utilization generally followed the same pattern as output.\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing at\na moderate pace this quarter, though a bit below that of the first quarter.\nPurchases of motor vehicles rebounded smartly after declining in the first\nquarter. Excluding motor vehicles, however, the expansion of real consumer\noutlays likely slowed of late, against a backdrop of modest gains in real\nincome. Recent measures of consumer confidence improved from their levels\nearlier in the spring, when higher gasoline prices and concerns about\na slowing in the pace of the economic expansion may have served as restraining\ninfluences.\n\nActivity in the housing sector remained robust. Single-family starts\naveraged more than 1.65 million units at an annual rate in April and May,\nnot much below the very strong first-quarter pace. Sales of both new and\nexisting homes remained at a high level in May. While prices of existing\nhomes continued to increase rapidly, new home prices showed signs of decelerating.\nAvailable indicators suggested that, with the ongoing support of low mortgage\nrates, the housing sector remained strong in June.\n\nSpending on equipment and software registered a solid increase in the\nfirst quarter, and the available data suggested that second-quarter spending\nwas continuing at a slightly faster pace. Shipments of nondefense capital\ngoods posted sizable increases in recent months, although gains in orders\nwere more uneven. Broadly speaking, the fundamentals continued to support\nbusiness investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporate\nbalance sheets healthy. Outlays for construction of nonresidential structures\nappeared to have picked up some, but the level of such investment remained\nsubdued. And although spending on commercial structures had moved up in\nrecent months, outlays for office buildings were still at depressed levels,\nand expenditures on manufacturing and other facilities were lackluster.\n\nThe book value of manufacturing and trade inventories continued to grow\nin April, but more slowly than in the first quarter. With these increases,\nthe inventory-sales ratio fell back in April after moving up a little\nin the first quarter.\n\nAfter reaching a record high relative to GDP in February, the U.S. international\ntrade deficit narrowed in March, but widened again in April. While the\nvalue of exports of goods and services increased in both months, the value\nof imports of goods and services jumped in April, more than offsetting\na decline in March. GDP growth in most major foreign industrial economies\npicked up slightly in the first quarter, but recent economic indicators\nfor the major foreign economies in the second quarter were mixed.\n\nConsumer prices were about unchanged in May after posting large increases\nin the previous few months. Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed\npart of their earlier run-up. Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared\nto have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year.\nDespite this moderation, measures of core consumer price inflation over\nthe past year were somewhat above those for the comparable period a year\nago. The producer price index rose sharply in April, but dropped back\nagain in May, driven largely by a swing in the food and energy components.\nAccording to recent surveys, both near-term and longer-term inflation\nexpectations had changed little over the past two months, and market measures\nof inflation compensation had moved lower. With regard to labor costs,\ngrowth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector in the first\nquarter was estimated to have slowed some after advancing notably in the\nfourth quarter; the first quarter increase was broadly similar to those\nposted during the middle of last year.\n\nAt its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase\nthe target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3 percent.\nIn its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception\nthat, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside\nrisks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability\nshould be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that recent data\nsuggested that the solid pace of spending growth had slowed somewhat,\npartly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices, but that\nlabor market conditions apparently continued to improve gradually. While\npressures on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power\nwas more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained.\nIn these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation\ncould be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that\nit would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill\nits obligation to maintain price stability.\n\nThe decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate\ntarget 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks\nto the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and\nto retain the \"measured pace\" language was widely expected in financial\nmarkets. The publication of the minutes three weeks later also contained\nfew surprises for investors and elicited little market reaction. Market\nexpectations for the future path of policy ended the period higher in\nthe near term but lower at longer horizons. Nominal Treasury yields followed\nthe shift in policy expectations, with near-term yields higher and longer-term\nyields modestly lower, on net. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds\nwere little changed over the intermeeting period, but spreads on speculative-grade\nbonds contracted notably. Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates\nand largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably\nover the intermeeting period. The positive economic data also seemed to\nlift the dollar against major foreign currencies, though the dollar's\nmoves against individual currencies varied widely.\n\nM2 edged lower over April and May as the opportunity cost of holding\nM2 assets rose further. Liquid deposits were especially weak, owing to\nthe slow adjustment of yields paid on these deposits to increases in market\nrates. Despite the recent softness in M2, its velocity remained quite\nlow relative to its historical relationships with opportunity cost. Bank\ncredit decelerated sharply in April and May from rapid gains posted in\nthe first quarter, as growth in both securities and loans fell.\n\nIn the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen\nas likely to expand this year and next at a rate just above its potential.\nThe effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected\nto be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an\nabatement of energy-related headwinds. Household spending was expected\nto firm going forward as real income posts solid gains attributable in\npart to the ongoing improvement in the labor market. Business investment\nwas projected to benefit from the combination of favorable prospects for\nsales, supportive financial markets, and the ongoing need to replace or\nupgrade aging equipment and software. A slightly larger portion of domestic\ndemand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period.\nThe forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation\nseen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher\nimport prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices,\nand only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane.\n\nIn their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,\nmany meeting participants noted that incoming data had been reassuring\nabout the strength of the expansion. Following some softer readings earlier\nin the year, incoming spending and production data over the intermeeting\nperiod indicated that the expansion remained firm, led by residential\nand business investment. In addition, labor market conditions continued\nto strengthen gradually. The economy evidently had been resilient in the\nface of rising energy prices, and financial conditions remained accommodative,\nsupporting growth going forward. Increases in core consumer prices had\nslowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting\nparticipants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled\nin part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices. However,\nthe impetus to inflation from the prices of oil and other commodities\nwas expected to wane, and long-term inflation expectations apparently\nremained well-anchored. With some limited remaining slack in labor markets\nlikely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of\npolicy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained.\n\nIn preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress\non monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents\nof the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth\nof GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for\n2005 and 2006. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were\nconcentrated in the upper part of a 3 to 3-3/4 percent range for 2005,\nand the forecasts for 2006 were concentrated at the lower end of a range\nof 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent. These rates of growth were associated\nwith a civilian unemployment rate of 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth\nquarter of this year and a rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of\n2006. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE\nprice index, were mainly near the middle of a 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent\nrange this year and somewhat below the middle of a range of 1-1/2\nto 2-1/2 percent next year.\n\nIn their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy,\nmeeting participants noted that the fundamentals underlying household\nspending remained firm. With rising home and equity prices buoying household\nwealth, consumer expenditures continued to advance. Although the recent\nsurge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time,\nconsumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going\nforward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets.\nIncreased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some\nparts of the country, but robust demand for new homes owed in large part\nto the ongoing economic expansion and low long-term interest rates.\n\nBusiness outlays for capital goods continued to rise, and the outlook\nfor investment spending remained solid, supported by increased sales,\nlow interest rates, robust profits, and strong business balance sheets.\nAnecdotal reports from industry contacts generally pointed to planned\nincreases in investment spending, though in some regions businesses apparently\nremained cautious about the outlook. Conditions in the commercial real\nestate sector, which had been weak for some time, were said to have improved\nin some parts of the nation.\n\nSeveral meeting participants expressed some concern about domestic and\nglobal imbalances. Large federal budget deficits were expected to persist\ndespite an increase in tax receipts in recent months. These deficits were\ncontributing to a low level of national saving that would, if not corrected\nover time, ultimately constrain investment and overall economic growth.\nMoreover, U.S. trade deficits were expected to remain large going forward,\nreflecting both the low level of U.S. saving and relatively slow growth\nin some of our trading partners. Uncertainties regarding the nature and\ntiming of the potential correction of these imbalances complicated the\nassessment of the intermediate-term prospects for the U.S. economy.\n\nIn their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants'\ncomments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest\nrates and the continued run-up in home prices. Despite substantial cumulative\npolicy tightening over the past year, long-term Treasury yields had moved\nconsiderably lower, implying a significant flattening of the yield curve\n(measured as the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields).\nLower compensation for inflation accounted for a portion of the decline\nin longer-term nominal yields, but a larger portion reflected reductions\nin real yields. Participants cited a variety of factors as possibly contributing\nto the unusual behavior of long-term rates over this period. For one,\ninvestors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen\nas likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line\nwith potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative\nto saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U.S.\ngrowth. However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with\nhigher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets. The\nbehavior of long-term interest rates could also reflect reduced uncertainty\non the part of investors about the economic outlook -- as seen in low\nreadings of implied volatility in bond and equity markets. Finally, demands\nfor longer-term U.S. securities by both domestic and foreign investors\nmight have been boosted by special factors. Confidence about the economic\noutlook and low market interest rates--along with possibly outsized expectations\nof capital gains in some markets--could also help to account for the high\nlevel of home prices the Committee had discussed on the first day of the\nmeeting. It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook\nfor both long-term interest rates and home prices.\n\nWith regard to any role for monetary policy in responding to possible\nimbalances in housing or bond markets, meeting participants stressed the\nimportance of the pursuit of their core objectives of price stability\nand maximum sustainable economic growth. To the extent that an asset price\nmovement threatened the achievement of those objectives, it would of course\nbe taken into consideration in setting policy. However, given the unavoidable\nuncertainties associated with judgments regarding the appropriate level\nof and likely future movements in asset prices, a strategy of responding\nmore directly to possible mispricing was seen as very unlikely to contribute,\non balance, to the achievement of the Committee's objectives over time.\n\nParticipants' views on the inflation outlook were mixed. Thus far in\n2005, core consumer price inflation had been higher than most participants\nhad expected at the start of the year, reflecting, at least in part, the\npass-through effects of higher energy, commodity, and import prices. While\nsuch shocks could be expected to boost inflation temporarily, some participants\nexpressed concern that, with policy still accommodative, the underlying\npace of inflation might be in the process of stepping up, perhaps to a\nlevel that was at the upper end of the range that they viewed as compatible\nwith the Committee's price stability objective. The degree of slack remaining\nin labor and resource markets was very uncertain, and unit labor costs\nin the nonfarm business sector had moved notably higher in recent quarters.\nTrend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural\nproductivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants\nthought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back\nin coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years.\nAnd with higher energy prices already eating into profit margins at firms\noutside the energy sector, increases in unit labor costs might be more\nlikely to be passed through into prices.\n\nWhile agreeing that inflation developments had to be watched carefully,\nother meeting participants emphasized that recent core inflation data\nhad been relatively restrained, and anecdotal reports suggested that pricing\npower at many firms remained quite limited. Moreover, readings from futures\nmarkets suggested that oil prices would likely flatten out, so their effect\non inflation should gradually ebb. Similarly, prices of other commodities\nand imports, which had surged for a time, were now moderating. Survey\nand market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest\nthat the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist. Finally,\nwhile the degree of slack in labor markets was uncertain, total labor\ncompensation had probably been boosted temporarily around the turn of\nthe year by special factors, and the recent behavior of a range of other\nindicators of labor costs appeared consistent with some remaining slack\nthat would likely tend to restrain inflation pressures. Moreover, anecdotal\nreports of labor market conditions continued to point to shortages of\nlabor only for certain, mostly skilled, occupations.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, all\nmembers agreed on a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds\nrate to 3-1/4 percent. Economic growth remained firm, while rising\nenergy, and possibly labor, costs threatened to put upward pressure on\ninflation. Even with this action, the federal funds rate remained below\nthe level members anticipated would prove necessary in the long run to\ncontain inflation pressures and keep output near potential. However, the\npace and extent of future policy moves would depend on incoming data.\n\nIn considering the statement to be released following this meeting,\nmembers concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices,\nthe expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually.\nAll also thought that the statement should note the continued pressures\non inflation, while mentioning that long-term inflation expectations remained\nwell contained. With policy still seen as accommodative, members agreed\nthat the statement should retain an assessment that the risks to both\nsustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced, conditional\non appropriate policy action. Members also agreed that the statement language\nindicating that \"policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is\nlikely to be measured\" correctly characterized the outlook for policy\nfor now. The members concurred that at this stage in the expansion, with\nmargins of slack resources narrowing and inflation somewhat higher, the\nCommittee needed to be particularly alert to signs of a further increase\nin inflation. Such an increase could be particularly problematic because\nit might impart upward momentum to inflation expectations that would be\ncostly to reverse. In any case, additional tightening would probably be\nnecessary, but views differed on the amount of tightening that would likely\nbe required to keep inflation contained and bring output in line with\npotential. However, members agreed that there was no need to make such\nan assessment at this time, and that the appropriate pace and degree of\ncumulative policy adjustment would depend on economic developments going\nforward. With the forward-looking language in the statement clearly conditioned\non the outlook, it was not seen as limiting the Committee's flexibility\nin responding to such developments.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize\nand direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed\notherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance\nwith the following domestic policy directive:\n\n\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions\nthat will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.\nTo further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future\nseeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal\nfunds rate to an average of around 3-1/4 percent.\"\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner,\nMs. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Fisher, Gramlich, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Santomero,\nand Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nTuesday, August 9, 2005.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:25 p.m.\n\nNotation Vote\n\nBy notation vote completed on May 23, 2005, the Committee unanimously\napproved the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee\nheld on May 3, 2005.\n\nVincent R.
