There were no open\nmarket operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in\nthe period since the previous meeting, and thus no vote was required\nof the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period August 18,\n1998, through September 28, 1998. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding at a moderate rate. Growth of private\ndomestic final demand had slowed from its pace in the first half of\nthe year, though it was still relatively robust, and reduced spending\non U.S. exports and rising import competition were exerting\nappreciable restraint on overall activity, as was a slowing in\ninventory investment. Reflecting the moderation in growth from the\nfirst half of the year, total payroll employment was trending up at a\nsomewhat slower pace. Despite the pressures on labor resources\nassociated with still-tight labor markets, trends in wages and prices\nremained stable.\n\nGrowth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed somewhat over the\nJuly-August period. The deceleration reflected further job losses in\nthe manufacturing sector, notably in the apparel and electronic\ncomponents industries on which the crisis in Asia was having a sizable\nadverse effect. Outside of manufacturing, employment increases\nremained strong in the service-producing industries, and even though\nanecdotal reports continued to indicate shortages of skilled workers,\nfurther sizable job gains were recorded in construction. The civilian\nunemployment rate stayed at 4.5 percent in August.\n\nIndustrial output rebounded in August as production at\nGeneral Motors resumed following the settlement of the labor strike.\nOutside the motor vehicle sector, however, output had changed little\non balance over recent months in association with the erosion in net\nexports stemming from the turmoil in Asia and its repercussions on a\nnumber of other U.S. trading partners; production of consumer goods\nedged down on balance in July and August, and the growth of output of\nbusiness equipment slowed. The rise in industrial production in\nAugust boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, but\nthe factory operating rate remained somewhat below the level of late\nlast year.\n\nTotal retail sales were held down in July and August by a\nsharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles, but non-auto sales\ncontinued to rise at a brisk pace. The gains were widespread, with\nincreases in spending on furniture and appliances, apparel, and\nmiscellaneous nondurables especially strong. Purchases of services\nalso were up appreciably further in July and August after a rapid\nsecond-quarter rise. Sales and construction of residential buildings\nremained quite strong on balance, reflecting very favorable homebuying\nconditions. Housing starts slipped in August but were still above the\nhigh level of the first half of the year. Sales of existing homes\ndropped back in August from the record high registered in July, while\nsales of new homes were slightly higher in July (latest data) than in\nthe first half of the year.\n\nAvailable indicators pointed to more moderate growth in\nbusiness fixed investment after the surge in capital spending during\nthe first half of the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods\ndeclined in July and August, retracing much of June's large increase,\nwhile sales of medium and heavy trucks continued to increase at a\nrapid pace. Nonresidential construction weakened in July, extending a\npattern of sluggish building activity; construction of industrial\nstructures remained in a downtrend, and office building activity\nchanged little on balance over June and July.\n\nBusiness inventory accumulation eased further in July after\nhaving slowed sharply in the second quarter, and inventory-sales\nratios remained moderate. Stockbuilding in manufacturing was at a\nsomewhat lower rate in July than in the second quarter, and the stock-shipments\nratio for the sector stayed a little above the low level\nthat had prevailed over the past year. At the wholesale level, a\nfurther decline in inventories reflected additional reductions in\nmotor vehicles; the inventory-shipments ratio remained in the upper\npart of its narrow range for the past year. In the retail sector, a\nsharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships more than offset a rise\nin stocks of other goods. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the\nretail sector was at a relatively low level.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed slightly in July from its second-quarter average, with the\nvalue of imports falling more than the value of exports. Much of the\ndecline in imports and exports involved trade in automotive products\nwith Canada and Mexico. Economic activity in the major foreign\nindustrial countries other than Japan decelerated on average in the\nsecond quarter, with a deterioration in net exports partially\noffsetting continued strength in domestic final demand. In Japan,\nactivity contracted for a third consecutive quarter; net exports made\na large positive contribution as imports dropped sharply, but domestic\ndemand, most notably business fixed investment, fell steeply.\n\nBoth the overall and the core CPI again rose moderately in\nAugust; a further increase in food prices was offset by a sizable\ndecrease in energy prices. For the twelve months ended in August,\ncore consumer prices rose slightly more than they had in the\nyear-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods\ndropped appreciably in August, largely reflecting declines in the\nprices of finished foods and, notably, energy goods. Producer prices\nof finished goods other than food and energy moved slightly higher in\nthe twelve months ended in August after having edged down in the year-\nearlier period. Producer prices at earlier stages of production were\nunder strong downward pressure; prices of intermediate materials fell\nduring the year ended in August by slightly more than they had risen\nin the year-earlier period, and prices of crude materials plunged\nfurther in the twelve months ended in August. Average hourly earnings\nof production or nonsupervisory workers continued to increase at a\nrelatively moderate pace in the July-August period, and for the twelve\nmonths ended in August, they rose slightly more than in the\nyear-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on August 18, 1998, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to\naverage around 5-1/2 percent. However, in light of mounting financial\nstrains abroad, their potential implications for the U.S. economy, and\nless accommodative conditions in domestic financial markets, the\nCommittee concluded that the risks to the outlook were no longer\ntilted toward rising inflation but had become more balanced.\nAccordingly, the Committee adopted a directive that did not include a\npresumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy\nduring the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the\nintermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on\nreserve positions, and the federal funds rate remained close to its\nintended level of 5-1/2 percent. In an atmosphere of greatly\nincreased volatility in financial asset values worldwide and a reduced\nappetite for risk among many investors, interest rates on U.S.\nTreasury securities, and to a much smaller extent on investment-grade\ncorporate debt, fell appreciably during the intermeeting period; in\ncontrast, yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms increased sharply,\nand a number of large banks tightened terms and standards for making\nbusiness loans to sizable firms. Credit conditions also tightened in\nEurope, Asia, and Latin America. Share prices in U.S. and foreign\nequity markets remained volatile during the intermeeting period, and\nmajor U.S. equity price indexes declined considerably further on\nbalance.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar depreciated substantially over the intermeeting period in\nrelation to other major currencies. A spreading perception that the\nUnited States was more vulnerable than either Europe or Japan to an\neconomic downturn in Latin America, increasing expectations of\nmonetary easing in the United States, and shifts into yen associated\nwith the end of the fiscal half-year in Japan and the unwinding of\nsome investment positions financed in yen were factors that weighed on\nthe dollar. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly in terms of\nan index of currencies that includes the developing countries of Latin\nAmerica and Asia that are important trading partners of the United\nStates.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 picked up considerably in August and\napparently strengthened further in September. The acceleration was\nthe result of unusually large inflows to money market funds that in\npart reflected households' preference for relatively safe, liquid\nplacements for funds shifted out of equities and lower-rated corporate\ndebt. For the year through September, both aggregates recorded growth\nrates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated somewhat in recent\nmonths after picking up earlier in the year.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting incorporated a\nconsiderably weaker assessment of underlying aggregate demand, owing\nto downward revisions to growth abroad and to the less accommodative\nconditions that were evolving in U.S. financial markets. The staff\nprojected that the expansion of economic activity would slow for a\ntime to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's\npotential and then would pick up to a rate more in line with that\npotential. Damped expansion of foreign economic activity and the\nlagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of\nthe dollar were expected to place considerable restraint on the demand\nfor U.S. exports for a period ahead and to lead to further\nsubstitution of imports for domestic products. Domestic production\nalso would be held back for a while by the efforts of firms to bring\ninventories into better balance with the anticipated moderation in the\ntrajectory of final sales. In addition, private final demand would be\nrestrained by tighter lending terms and conditions as well as the drop\nthat had occurred in equity prices. Pressures on labor resources were\nlikely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed,\nbut inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a\npartial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members focused on developments that pointed to\nthe potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending.\nThey recognized that there were at present few statistical indications\nthat the economy was on a significantly slower growth track. Indeed,\nthe available data suggested that consumer expenditures and business\ninvestment retained considerable strength. At the same time, however,\ninvestors' perceptions of risks and their aversion to taking on more\nrisk had increased markedly in financial markets around the world.\nThat change in sentiment was exacerbating financial and economic\nproblems in a number of important trading partners of the United\nStates. In addition, it was generating lower equity prices and\ntightening credit availability in U.S. financial markets. As a\nconsequence, the downside risks to the domestic expansion appeared to\nhave risen substantially in recent weeks. Though labor markets were\nexpected to remain relatively tight for some time, the members saw\nlittle prospect that inflation would gather significant momentum in\ncoming quarters. Declining commodity and other import prices would be\nrestraining prices and inflation expectations for a while. Overall\nconsumer prices might rise a little more rapidly next year as the\neffects of a number of favorable factors, such as falling energy\nprices, diminished or reversed, but underlying inflation was expected\nto stay quite subdued as inflation expectations remained damped and\npressures in labor markets became less pronounced.\n\nThe intensification and further spread of turmoil in\ninternational financial markets, notably since the outbreak of a financial\ncrisis in Russia in mid-August, had spilled over into U.S. financial\nmarkets. Strong demands for safety and liquidity had driven down\nyields on U.S. Treasury securities, but spreads of private rates over\nTreasury rates had gapped higher. Increases in risk spreads were\nespecially large for lower-grade borrowers and on bonds below\ninvestment grade, whose rates had increased considerably since\nmid-August. In addition, many banks had tightened their credit standards\nand terms. Prices in U.S. equity markets, which had weakened\nappreciably before the crisis in Russia, had declined substantially\nfurther. These market developments strongly suggested, and anecdotal\nreports tended to confirm, the emergence of widespread perceptions of\ngreater risks in a broad range of financial investment activities and\nof considerably greater reluctance to put capital at risk. The\nmembers did not believe that the tightness in credit markets and\nstrong demand for safety and liquidity were likely to lead to a\n\"credit crunch,\" though some members expressed the view that such an\noutcome could not be ruled out. At a time when business balance\nsheets already indicated a significant softening of cash flows owing\nto weaker profits, many business firms were experiencing increased\ndifficulty and costs in their efforts to raise funds in debt or equity\nmarkets or to borrow from lending institutions; if these conditions\nwere to persist, the sustainability of the current strength in\nbusiness capital expenditures would come into question. The decline\nin stock market prices also appeared likely to damp the growth of\nconsumer spending over time, with added implications for business\ncapital expenditures.\n\nDespite the emergence of decidedly less hospitable financial\nconditions, there were few indications in the data available to the\nCommittee of any weakening as yet in consumer and business spending.\nConsumer expenditures, though temporarily held back by shortages of\nnew motor vehicles stemming from the work stoppage at General Motors,\nhad remained on a solid uptrend, with overall growth in recent months\napparently slipping only a little from a remarkably rapid pace in the\nfirst half of the year. Strong growth in jobs and incomes along with\nsubstantial further increases in stock market prices through mid-July\nhad fostered a high level of consumer confidence and spending.\nMembers commented that the more recent weakness in the stock market\nand the related decline in household net worth had removed an\nimportant support for the growth of consumer spending, but they noted\nthat recent surveys indicated only a slight deterioration in consumer\nsentiment and that the stimulus from earlier stock market gains\nprobably would dissipate only gradually. Looking further ahead,\nconsumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more\nin line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in\nrecent years.\n\nGrowth in business investment spending, while apparently\nmoderating from an extraordinary pace during the first half of the\nyear, likewise seemed to have been little affected to date by the\ntightening in credit conditions and the increased aversion to\nrisktaking. Data on shipments of capital equipment continued to\ndisplay a clear uptrend and members reported very strong construction\nactivity in many parts of the country. Declining relative prices and\nrapid technological advances were likely to generate appreciable\nfurther growth in spending for computer and office equipment over the\nprojection horizon. Moreover, new orders for capital equipment did\nnot suggest any general weakening, though such orders had declined\ndramatically in the steel industry under the weight of intense foreign\ncompetition. Even so, the members anticipated that the pronounced\nincrease in investor and lender perceptions of risk would result in\nconsiderable moderation in the growth of overall business investment,\nespecially in light of concurrent expectations of reduced gains in\nsales and profits and evidence of some diminution in both internal and\nexternal sources of financing. Reports from nearly every Federal\nReserve District suggested that executives had become considerably\nmore concerned about business prospects. In a number of cases they\nalready had seen a substantial downturn in their exports or a surge in\ncompeting imports at prices they found difficult to match. In other\ncases they were anticipating such developments or were reacting to the\ngeneral sense of unease and uncertainty evident in financial markets.\nForthcoming data on capital spending including new orders and\ncontracts were likely to point to a weaker uptrend in business fixed\ninvestment. How much weaker was a major uncertainty in the economic\noutlook and a key to determining the extent to which financial market\nturmoil was likely to affect the real economy.\n\nVery favorable underlying factors, including a strong job\nmarket and declining mortgage rates, had helped to sustain\nhomebuilding activity at an elevated level. The large further advance\nin stock market prices earlier in the year also appeared to have been\na positive factor in the strong performance of the housing market.\nWhile anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only\na few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices\nand forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some\nmoderation in housing activity at some point. Even so, the continued\naffordability of new homes for many households was likely to sustain\nhousing demand at a relatively high albeit diminished level, and\nhomebuilding activity would be bolstered for a time as backlogs\ncreated by shortages of skilled construction workers in many areas\nwere worked off.\n\nNet exports, while subject to a great deal of uncertainty,\nwere seen as likely to continue to restrain demand and production to a\nsubstantial extent over coming quarters. Members cited examples from\nacross the country of business firms, notably in the manufacturing\nsector but also in energy, agriculture, forest products, and some\nother industries, that already were being adversely affected by weaker\nexport markets and increased competition from lower-priced imports.\nMoreover, the intensification of turmoil in international financial\nmarkets since the Russian devaluation and debt moratorium had led to\ntighter financial conditions in key U.S. trading partners--especially\nin the Americas--a development that was likely to weaken growth in\nthose markets and demand for U.S. products. Of potentially greater\nimportance for the domestic economic outlook, however, was the spread\nof international financial unsettlement to U.S. financial markets and\nthe attendant deterioration in business and investor confidence. It\nwas clear that the contagious effects of international economic and\nfinancial turmoil had markedly increased the downside threat to the\ndomestic expansion.\n\nIn their comments about the outlook for inflation, members\nreferred to the persistence of very tight labor markets across the\nnation and to indications of escalating increases in labor\ncompensation in a number of areas. At the same time, price inflation\ngenerally had remained subdued, with little evidence of acceleration.\nAs had been true for an extended period, competitive pressures were\nwidely reported to be preventing employers from passing through rising\nlabor costs to consumer prices. Looking ahead, members cited a\nvariety of factors bearing on the prospects for inflation that on the\nwhole suggested that the risks of an inflationary uptrend had receded.\nFavorable factors in the outlook for prices included the lingering\neffects of the dollar's earlier appreciation, ample industrial\ncapacity, generally declining commodity and other import prices, and\nan apparently more rapid trend of productivity gains. Over time, some\nslowing in economic growth and less intense pressures on labor\nresources would hold down increases in labor costs. Developments that\nmight tend to offset these positive factors, at least in part,\nincluded a possible turnaround in energy prices after sizable declines\nover the past year and an upturn in the costs of worker benefits,\nnotably for medical expenses. A few members also observed that the\nrapid growth of key monetary aggregates, including M2, over a period\nof several quarters was a worrisome element in the outlook for\ninflation, though the most recent surge in M2 probably was induced in\nlarge measure by a flight to quality and liquidity.\n\nIn their discussion of policy for the intermeeting period\nahead, all the members endorsed a proposal calling for a slight\neasing in reserve markets to produce a decline of 1/4 percentage point\nin the federal funds rate to an average of about 5-1/4 percent. In\ntheir view, such an action was desirable to cushion the likely adverse\nconsequences on future domestic economic activity of the global\nfinancial turmoil that had weakened foreign economies and of the\ntighter conditions in financial markets in the United States that had\nresulted in part from that turmoil. At a time of abnormally high\nvolatility and very substantial uncertainty, it was impossible to\npredict how financial conditions in the United States would evolve.\nIn the view of many members, equity prices and risk spreads in U.S.\nfinancial markets previously had embodied an overly optimistic\nassessment of business prospects and they saw some correction in these\nmarkets as a positive development. Moreover, they expected markets to\nbecome much more settled once the initial adjustments to new risk\nassessments had been made. On balance, however, credit conditions\nwere likely to remain tighter and equity prices lower than earlier,\nand in the context of continued damped inflation, monetary policy\nhad the room to adjust to these new circumstances. In any event, an\neasing policy action at this point could provide added insurance\nagainst the risk of a further worsening in financial conditions and a\nrelated curtailment in the availability of credit to many borrowers.\n\nThe members agreed that the decrease in the federal funds\nrate should be limited to 25 basis points. Several emphasized in this\nregard that although the risk of rising inflation might have receded,\nit was still present, especially in light of the persistence to date\nof very tight labor markets and relatively robust economic growth. In\nthese circumstances, while an easing move was warranted to provide\nsome insurance against undesirably tight domestic financial\nconditions, many members saw the need for a cautious policy action. A\nmore sizable policy move at this point might convey an exaggerated\nimpression of the Committee's current thinking regarding the extent of\ndownside risks in the economy.\n\nThe members were divided over whether to retain the current\nsymmetrical directive or to adopt an asymmetrical directive that would\nbe tilted toward ease. A small majority favored moving to asymmetry\non the grounds that it seemed more consistent with the increased\ndownside risks to the economy that they believed would exist even\nafter the contemplated policy action and that it would underscore the\nCommittee's readiness to respond promptly to conditions that might\nthreaten the sustainability of the expansion. Other members expressed\na preference for a symmetric directive but indicated that they could\naccept a directive that was tilted toward ease. In their opinion, the\nuncertainties relating to the direction of the next policy move were\nsufficiently great on both sides to justify a neutral directive. Some\ncommented that unanticipated developments were likely in any event to\nprovide the principal basis for future policy actions. They suggested\nthat the Committee would undoubtedly confer by telephone should such\ndevelopments materialize during the intermeeting period, and the\nsymmetry or asymmetry of the directive would have little bearing on\nwhatever policy decision might be reached.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers supported a directive that called for conditions in reserve\nmarkets that would be consistent with a slight decrease in the federal\nfunds rate to an average of about 5-1/4 percent. All the members also\nindicated that they could accept a change in the directive to include\na bias toward easing. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher\nfederal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal\nfunds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be\nconsistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the\nmonths ahead.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed,\nuntil instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions\nin the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy\ndirective:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Jordan,\nKelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and\nMs. Rivlin.\n\nMost interest rates have fallen appreciably since\nthe meeting on August 18, though yields on the bonds of\nlower-rated firms have increased and a number of large\nbanks have tightened terms and standards for making\nbusiness loans. Broadly similar developments have\noccurred in major foreign markets. Share prices in U.S.\nand global equity markets have remained volatile and\nmajor indexes have declined considerably further on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar\ndeclined substantially over the intermeeting period in\nrelation to other major currencies; it was up slightly in\nterms of an index of the currencies of the developing\ncountries of Latin America and Asia that are important\ntrading partners of the United States.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in\nAugust and appeared to have picked up further in\nSeptember, partly reflecting shifts of funds by\nhouseholds out of investments in equities and lower-rated\ncorporate debt. For the year through September, both\naggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's\nranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has moderated somewhat in recent\nmonths after a pickup earlier in the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting\non June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2\nto 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was\nmaintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the\nCommittee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same\nranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth\nquarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with decreasing the federal funds rate to an\naverage of around 5-1/4 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na slightly higher federal funds rate might or a somewhat\nlower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with some moderation in the\ngrowth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nNone.\n\nAt this meeting, the Committee reviewed its current practices\nrelating to its policy announcements, meeting minutes, and directive\nwording. This discussion was part of an ongoing appraisal of the\nCommittee's disclosure policies. The Committee took no action at this\nmeeting but agreed that further review of some of these issues would\nbe appropriate.\n\nThe Committee discussed the limited role of the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York in facilitating a private-sector resolution\nof the severe financial problems encountered in the portfolio managed\nby Long-Term Capital Management L.P. The size and nature of the\npositions of this fund were such that their sudden liquidation in\nalready unsettled financial markets could well have induced further\nfinancial dislocations around the world that could have impaired the\neconomies of many nations, including that of the United States.\nAgainst this background, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had\nbrought together key interested parties with the aim of increasing the\nprobability of an orderly private-sector solution to the hedge fund's\ndifficulties.\n\nIn a telephone conference held on October 15, 1998, the\nCommittee members discussed recent economic and financial developments\nand their implications for monetary policy. Risk aversion in\nfinancial markets had increased further since the Committee's meeting\nin September, raising volatility and risk spreads even more, eroding\nmarket liquidity, and constraining borrowing and lending in a number\nof sectors of the financial markets. Although indications of any\nsoftening in the pace of the economic expansion across the country\nremained sparse, the widespread signs of deteriorating business\nconfidence and evidence of less accommodative domestic financial\nconditions suggested that the downside risks to the expansion had\ncontinued to mount.\n\nAgainst this background, a consensus emerged in favor of a\n1/4 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate that would\naccompany a reduction in the discount rate that the Board of Governors\nwas expected to approve at a meeting following this telephone\nconference. Some members were concerned that a policy move so soon\nafter the late September action might be misread as indicative of a\ndegree of concern about prospective developments in financial markets\nor the economic outlook that did not represent the Committee's\nthinking. However, the members generally concluded that the risk of\nadverse market reactions was worth taking and that the easing actions\nunder consideration were more likely to help settle volatile financial\nmarkets and cushion the effects of more restrictive financial\nconditions on the ongoing expansion. At the conclusion of this\ndiscussion, the Chairman indicated that he would instruct the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York to lower the intended federal funds rate by\n25 basis points, consistent with the Committee's directive issued at\nthe meeting on September 29, 1998.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, November 17, 1998.\n\nThe meeting on September 29 adjourned at 2:40 p.m.\n\nAttended portion of the meeting relating to the Committee's\ndisclosure policies.\n\nAttended portion of meeting relating to developments stemming from\nthe financial difficulties of a large hedge fund."
