Vander Wilt\n\n- Associate Economists\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was\nselected to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account\nuntil the adjournment of the first meeting of the Committee after\nDecember 31, 1995.\n\nBy unanimous vote, Peter R. Fisher was selected to serve at\nthe pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account,\non the understanding that his selection was subject to being\nsatisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nSecretary's note: Advice subsequently was received\nthat the selection of Mr. Fisher was satisfactory to\nthe board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on December 20, 1994, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets since the December meeting.\nThere were no market transactions for System Account during this\nperiod, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nDecember 20, 1994, through January 31, 1995. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested a strong\nfurther rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994.\nAlthough consumer spending appeared to be less buoyant and housing\ndemand had softened somewhat, growth in business investment, exports,\nand inventories remained brisk. Industrial production and payroll\nemployment continued to record substantial gains. Broad indexes of\nprices for consumer goods and services had risen moderately on average\nover recent months despite shrinking margins of unemployed resources\nand further sizable increases in the prices of many materials.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment advanced considerably further in\nDecember after a sharp rise in November. Substantial job gains were\nrecorded in December in service industries and in the retail trade\nsector. Hiring in manufacturing was brisk for a third straight month,\nwith labor demand especially strong in motor vehicles, capital goods,\nand electronic equipment. Construction payrolls slipped after a large\nincrease in November. The average workweek was unchanged in December,\nbut factory overtime edged back up, matching the highest level reached\nin the history of this series. The civilian unemployment rate\ndeclined to 5.4 percent.\n\nIndustrial production registered another large advance in\nDecember. Manufacturing accounted for all of the gain; an upturn in\nmining production offset a decline in the output of utilities\nassociated with unseasonably warm weather. In manufacturing, the\noutput of motor vehicles and parts surged again and further solid\ngains were recorded in the production of other goods. The large\nadvance in industrial output in December boosted rates of capacity\nutilization above already high levels.\n\nRetail sales were reported to have changed little over\nNovember and December after substantial advances in September and\nOctober; the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases\nin outlays for non-auto consumer goods. Consumer spending on services\nrose moderately on balance over November and December, with outlays\nfor energy services held down by unusually mild weather. Although\nsome indicators of housing demand had weakened, housing starts posted\nsizable gains on balance over November and December; single-family\nconstruction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in\nmortgage rates in 1994, and multifamily construction continued its\ngradual recovery from the depressed levels of early 1993. The\nregional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather\naccounted for little of the strength in December.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was estimated to have grown at a\nvery rapid pace in the fourth quarter, with a pickup indicated for\nbusiness spending on both equipment and nonresidential structures.\nNew orders for nondefense capital goods declined on balance over\nNovember and December, but the large backlog of unfilled orders,\nespecially for computers, pointed to a continued strong expansion in\nspending on business equipment in coming months. Nonresidential\nconstruction activity was up considerably in November for a third\nstraight month, with increases in construction widespread by type of\nstructure. Recent data indicated that permits for nonresidential\nconstruction were continuing to trend higher and perhaps were running\nahead of construction activity.\n\nBusiness inventory investment remained brisk in November; in\nthe aggregate, the buildup was in line with shipments and sales. In\nmanufacturing, stocks increased more rapidly in November, but the\nratio of stocks to shipments declined further and was at a\nhistorically low level. In wholesale trade, inventories rose less\nrapidly in November, but the inventory-to-sales ratio increased\nfurther, although it remained within its range of recent years.\nInventory accumulation slowed a little at the retail level, and the\ninventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of\nits range of recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened somewhat further in November, and for October and November\ncombined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third\nquarter. The value of exports of goods and services increased more\nslowly in the October-November period than in the third quarter,\nlargely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies.\nThe rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the\nOctober-November period was led by increased imports of non-oil\nindustrial supplies and automotive, capital, and consumer goods.\nAvailable data for the fourth quarter of 1994 indicated continued\ngrowth in economic activity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace,\nin the major foreign industrial countries.\n\nConsumer price inflation slowed a little in December despite\na jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in\nenergy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices edged\nup in December and rose significantly less in 1994 than in 1993. At\nthe producer level, prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly\nin December, with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food\nprices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased\nmodestly in 1994 after being held down in 1993 by a sharp drop in the\nprices of tobacco products. In contrast to prices of finished goods,\nprice inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in 1994.\nFor intermediate goods other than food and energy items, prices rose\nat a faster rate in the second half of 1994, with the pickup most\nclearly evident in materials used in manufacturing. Prices of crude\nmaterials rose rapidly in the second half of 1994 and for the year as\na whole. Increases in labor costs remained moderate. Average hourly\nearnings were little changed on balance over November and December,\nand for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in\n1993. More broadly, hourly compensation of private industry workers\nincreased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the\nprevious three quarters of 1994, and the rise for the year was\nsignificantly less than in 1993.\n\nAt its meeting on December 20, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. With the need for seasonal credit diminishing over the\nperiod, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended lower but averaged\na little above anticipated levels. Near year-end, the Trading Desk\naccommodated heavy demands for reserves through System RPs. The\nfederal funds rate averaged close to 5-1/2 percent during the\nintermeeting period.\n\nMost other market interest rates declined slightly on balance\nover the period after the December 20 meeting. Very short term\ninterest rates fell after the first of the year, reflecting the\ndisappearance of year-end premiums. More broadly, favorable news on\ninflation and indications of some unexpected slowing in the growth of\nfinal demands apparently led market participants to conclude that\nfurther tightening of monetary policy, though still expected to be\nsubstantial, would be less than previously thought and would be spread\nover a longer period. Yields on tax-exempt instruments declined\nconsiderably as concerns about the implications of Orange County's\nproblems for the financial condition of other municipal governments\nabated. Strong earning reports for the fourth quarter boosted major\nindexes of equity prices.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over\nthe intermeeting period. The dollar fell substantially against the\nmark, which was buoyed by safe-haven inflows from weaker European\ncurrencies, but dropped less against the yen. One factor that weighed\nagainst the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S.\neconomy of the sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso and the related\neconomic and financial problems in Mexico and other developing\neconomies; market participants expressed some concern that the crisis\nmight constrain U.S. monetary policy in the event of further domestic\ninflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective\nreduction in the Mexican current account deficit would lie importantly\nin the already substantial U.S. deficit.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December, and data for\nthe first half of January suggested a further acceleration in that\nmonth. Much of the pickup in M2 in December was due to rapid\nexpansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight\nEurodollars, which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts\nassociated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by\nshifting funds into market instruments. The faster growth of M3\nreflected, in addition to the acceleration of its M2 component, bank\nuse of large CDs and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively\nrobust demands for credit. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at the lower end of the Committee's\nrange for 1994 and M3 in the lower half of its range. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent\nmonths, and for 1994 it was in the lower half of its monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next\nseveral quarters and for some period thereafter would average less\nthan the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. Consumer\nspending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be\nrestrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of\npent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on\nthe demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were\nexpected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing\ncosts and slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was\nanticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs\nand income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage\nrates. Recent developments in Mexico were expected to cut into\nexports in the near term, but the sustained economic growth elsewhere\nwould keep export demand on an uptrend. Although there was\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, in light of the\nCongressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast\nincorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had\nbeen built into recent forecasts. In the staff's judgment, the\neconomy currently was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary\ncapacity, and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could\nratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, the members agreed that growth in economic\nactivity could be expected to moderate considerably over the course of\n1995, although inflation was likely to be higher than in 1994. They\nacknowledged that their current projections were subject to\nsubstantial risks. The expansion continued to display appreciable\nmomentum and signs of slower growth were still quite limited and\ntentative. Even so, the members remained persuaded that the lagged\neffects of the policy tightening implemented over the course of 1994\nwould become increasingly evident in interest-sensitive sectors of the\neconomy as the year progressed. The projected moderation in the\ngrowth of final demands, which probably would be concentrated at least\ninitially in the housing and consumer durables sectors, would\nundoubtedly reinforce an expected cutback in inventory investment from\nits unsustainable pace in recent quarters. A key uncertainty in the\noutlook was whether the slowing in overall economic growth would be\nsufficient to relieve the current pressures on labor and other\nproducer resources, which many members saw as portending higher\ninflation, or, indeed, whether such pressures would intensify further.\nOpinions differed to some degree with regard to both the likely extent\nof the prospective slowing in economic growth and the outlook for\ninflation. However, most of the members concluded that some rise in\ninflation appeared probable over coming quarters, and they were\nconcerned that this upturn would not be reversed and could be extended\nin the absence of further monetary restraint.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nestablishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt\naggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank\npresidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual\nprojections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and\ninflation for the year 1995. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1994\nto the fourth quarter of 1995, their forecasts of the growth in real\nGDP had a central tendency of 2 to 3 percent, compared with a growth\nrate of 4 percent estimated for 1994. Most of the members also\nanticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would\nbe associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their\nprojections of the rate in the fourth quarter of 1995 were centered in\na narrow range around 5-1/2 percent. The high levels of resource\nutilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members\nas likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices.\nAccordingly, projections of the rate of inflation, as indexed by the\nconsumer price index, had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for\nthe period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of\n1995, compared with rates of about 2-3/4 percent in both 1993 and\n1994.\n\nIn their review of regional economic developments, members\nreferred to widespread evidence of further growth in business\nactivity, but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some\nsoftening in a few areas or industries. Several emphasized, however,\nthat the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant\nmoderation in the overall growth of the economy. With regard to\nfinancial conditions, members commented that they saw little\nindication that policy tightening actions over the past year were\nconstraining the availability of credit to any observable degree.\nDespite higher interest rates, financial conditions remained broadly\nsupportive of further economic expansion. The performance of stock\nmarket prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt\nmarkets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among\ninvestors. Members also took note of the accommodative lending\npolicies of banking institutions. Those policies had encouraged rapid\ngrowth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing\nto the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. Some members\nexpressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their\nlending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their\nloan portfolios.\n\nIn their assessment of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members referred to the sluggish behavior of non-auto retail\nsales in November and December, but they also noted that the available\ninformation on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this\nyear was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a\nslowing trend. Anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed, and\nevidence of some decline in January sales of motor vehicles needed to\nbe evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new\nreporting method. Consumer confidence was at a high level, but some\nmembers observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was\nlikely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point.\nIn this regard, however, it was pointed out that rising consumer\nincomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly\nthus far. On balance, the members believed that the growth in\nconsumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though\nsuch spending might be relatively well maintained for some period,\ngiven the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready\navailability of financing to many consumers. In any event, the\noutlook for this sector of the economy, which was critical to any\nsignificant moderation in overall economic growth, was uncertain with\nregard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing.\n\nHousing construction was cited as potentially the most\nimportant demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute\nto more moderate economic growth over the year ahead. As evidenced by\nnationwide data through the end of 1994, single-family housing starts\nhad held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home\nmortgage rates, but anecdotal reports from around the country had\npointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and\ncontinued to do so. Against the background of current mortgage rate\nlevels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness,\nthe members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing, at\nleast in the single-family sector. The mild uptrend in the much\nsmaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period,\ngiven low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas, and further\nimprovement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to\nsome extent the overall slowing in housing construction.\n\nIn the capital goods sector, real business-fixed investment\nhad strengthened further in the fourth quarter, and the members\nbelieved, on the basis of rising order backlogs and the strength of\npermits for new business construction, that considerable momentum had\ncarried into this year. While the growth in spending for business\nequipment undoubtedly would moderate from its extraordinary pace over\nan extended period, large business profits and the still relatively\nlow user cost of capital would tend to support appreciable further\ngrowth in such investment in the context of elevated levels of\ncapacity utilization and ongoing efforts, induced by strong market\ncompetition, to increase productivity. Moreover, nonresidential\nconstruction was now trending higher, with particular strength evident\nin industrial and commercial construction.\n\nThe pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was\nviewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen\nas likely over the forecast horizon, though the precise timing and\nextent were impossible to predict. While slower growth in final\ndemand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp\nadjustment in inventory investment, members cited factors that could\nmute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall GDP.\nThese included relatively low inventory/sales ratios across much of\nthe economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended\ninventory accumulation. Moreover, because an unusually large share of\nthe inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports,\na cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller-than-usual\nimpact on domestic production. There was no current evidence that\ninventory investment was slowing, and indeed recent data on business\nloans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory\naccumulation since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, as more\nmoderate growth in final demand began to emerge, concerns about the\navailability of materials used in the production process or stocks\nneeded to meet market demand should diminish, and business firms could\nbe expected to trim their demand for inventories, perhaps aggressively\nfor a time. Indeed, this sector of the economy might well account for\nmuch of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during\nthe year ahead.\n\nFiscal policy was under active debate in the Congress, and\nthe members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain. The\nemergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a\nreasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts, albeit an\nassumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error. In any\nevent, any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely\nto have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps\nalso on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.\n\nDevelopments in Mexico and their possible repercussions in\nother developing nations had negative implications for U.S. exports,\nat least over the short run. Indeed, some members cited anecdotal\nevidence that reduced trade with Mexico had already emerged since late\n1994. Moreover, the effects of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, seemed\nto be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk\ngoods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term. Looking\nbeyond the months immediately ahead, the relatively robust growth\nprojected for many industrial countries together with the lower value\nof the dollar should boost the nation's overall external trade\nbalance, though probably not to the extent of providing substantial\nstimulus to the economy. One member observed that a number of\ncountries throughout the world faced the potential for important\nchanges in political conditions that could have adverse effects on\ntheir growth and trading relationships, with possible repercussions on\nU.S. exports.\n\nMembers commented that the strong growth in economic activity\nand high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid\nincreases in the prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods\nused in the production process, but contrary to numerous forecasts\nthese developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation\nas measured by the prices of final goods and services. This favorable\ndevelopment might be explained in part by lags in the inflation\ntransmission process and perhaps to some degree by various structural\nchanges and productivity improvements in recent years that may have\nraised both the level and the rate of increase of the economy's\npotential for sustained activity. Many members observed, however,\nthat it would not be prudent from a monetary policy standpoint to\nassume that continued rapid economic growth and further pressures on\nproducer resources would not lead to rising inflation over the\nquarters ahead. While competitive pressures still generally limited\nthe extent to which business firms could pass through rising costs of\nraw materials and other producer inputs to the prices of final goods,\nthe members referred to increasingly numerous examples of successful\nefforts to raise such prices and to apparently growing business\nexpectations that it would be possible to implement such increases\nover the months ahead. On balance, the members generally were\npersuaded that the economy had attained levels of labor and capital\nutilization that implied a strong risk of rising inflation over coming\nquarters.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates in 1995 that it had established on a tentative basis\nat its meeting in July 1994. The tentative ranges included expansion\nof 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The monitoring\nrange for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set\nprovisionally at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The ranges for M2 and M3\nwere unchanged from those that the Committee had used in 1994, while\nthe range for debt was one percentage point lower.\n\nAll the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the ranges that\nthe Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1994. While some\nacceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the\npace in 1994 could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a\nstaff analysis, monetary expansion within the ranges in question\nappeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of\nnominal GDP that the members were projecting for 1995 and that they\nviewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation. Moreover, the\nranges for the broad monetary aggregates had been reduced over the\npast decade to levels that, notably in the case of M2, should now be\nconsistent over long periods with the Committee's objectives for\nstable prices and maximum sustainable economic growth. This outcome\nwould depend on the restoration over time of the historical velocity\npatterns linking the monetary aggregates to broad measures of economic\nperformance, including a level velocity trend for M2. It was noted in\nthis regard that until recent years the growth of M3 had tended to\nexceed that of M2--a pattern that seemed to be re-emerging--and\ntherefore a somewhat higher range might be set for M3 than for M2.\nHowever, the members did not believe that a persuasive argument could\nbe made at this juncture for raising the M3 range, though they did not\nwant to rule out the option of doing so later, possibly when the\nranges were reviewed at midyear. Indeed, to make the change at this\npoint might convey a misleading message regarding the Committee's\npolicy intentions or its confidence in prospective monetary growth\nrelationships.\n\nThe Committee also considered the potential advantages and\ndisadvantages of setting specific targets for bringing inflation down\nand achieving price stability over time. Such targets might provide\nan alternative or supplemental approach to the monetary growth ranges,\nwhich had been found to be unreliable guides for monetary policy over\nthe past several years. The members discussed a number of aspects of\ninflation targeting. On the one hand, such targeting would help to\nanchor the conduct of monetary policy and progress in meeting these\nobjectives could enhance the credibility of the Federal Reserve and\nperhaps reduce the overall cost of attaining price stability. On the\nother hand, close adherence to preset inflation targets could unduly\nconstrain the Federal Reserve in its efforts to counteract the effects\nof cyclical shortfalls in the performance of the economy. The members\nagreed that the discussion had been helpful in outlining the issues\nand that the subject should be revisited. It was noted in this\nconnection that the Committee might be asked to comment during the\nmonths ahead on specific Congressional proposals for inflation\ntargeting.\n\nAt the conclusion of its discussion, all the members voted to\napprove without change the tentative ranges for 1995 that the\nCommittee had established in July of last year. In keeping with its\nusual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would\nreview its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions\nwarranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the\naggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments.\nAccordingly, the following longer-run policy statement for 1995 was\napproved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price\nstability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\nmeeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth\nquarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money\ngrowth within these ranges would be consistent with its\nbroad policy objectives. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered\nto 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow,\nMses. Phillips and Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members indicated that they could support some\nfirming in reserve conditions, though a few preferred to delay such an\naction pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant\nnew information that could help the Committee to evaluate whether and\nto what extent the economic expansion might be slowing. Most of the\nmembers were convinced, however, that current monetary policy should\nbe adjusted promptly to a more clearly restrictive stance. In their\nview, prompt action was needed to counter inflationary pressures and\ninflationary expectations in an economy that already seemed to be\noperating at, and perhaps beyond, sustainable capacity levels and to\nbe continuing to expand at a pace above its long-run potential. In\nthese circumstances, a delay in tightening policy would incur an\nunacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop\nin the economy and would require more tightening over time than might\notherwise be needed to achieve the Committee's objectives. Part of\nthe risk involved a potential further decline in the dollar at a time\nwhen there already was considerable concern about rising pressures on\nprices. Some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally\nanticipated in markets, and a failure to take action now was likely in\nthe view of a number of members to raise questions about the\ncredibility of the System's anti-inflation resolve and to generate\nsome unsettlement in financial markets, notably in the foreign\nexchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to\nfurther weakness. In terms of balancing the policy risks that were\ninvolved, a prompt move would provide some insurance against what\nthese members viewed as the principal risk in current circumstances--that of rising inflation. The risks of excessive tightening, while\nnot completely absent, were believed to be limited in light of the apparent strength and momentum of the expansion, which many\nforecasters had underestimated over the past year. One member\nexpressed the view that while monetary growth had been damped,\ncontinuing restraint on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates\nwas desirable to offset a previous build-up in liquidity and help\nassure that inflationary pressures would be contained.\n\nMembers who saw an advantage in postponing a decision to\ntighten policy commented that, in light of some scattered signs of a\nmoderating expansion, it would be helpful to wait for certain key\nstatistics that would become available within the next few weeks to\njudge the extent of any moderation. Data on retail sales in January\nmight provide particular insights as to whether the softening in such\nsales in November and December was persisting. The favorable news on\ninflation in the fourth quarter had lessened concerns about an\nimmediate inflation threat, and if the incoming information confirmed\nthe need for further tightening, the short delay in implementing it\nwould have only a minimal cost. In addition, an increase in monetary\nrestraint would be likely to exacerbate the problems of Mexico and\nperhaps to some extent those of Canada and would have potentially\nadverse implications for U.S. trade with both of these key trading\npartners. Because the probability that incoming information would\ncounsel against any further policy tightening was certainly less than\n50 percent so that only a matter of timing was likely to be involved,\nthese members indicated that they would join with the other members in\nvoting to tighten policy at this meeting.\n\nConcerning the possible need to adjust policy during the\nintermeeting period, the members were unanimously in favor of adopting\na symmetric directive. Given a decision to implement some tightening\nin monetary policy at this meeting, they did not believe that there\nshould be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this\nperiod. A number of members observed that further monetary restraint\nmight not be needed if, in line with their expectations, the incoming\nevidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the\nexpansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a\ngrowth path consistent with containing inflation pressures. In any\nevent, the Committee's most difficult decision over the next several\nquarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening\nwas no longer desirable.\n\nPrior to the end of the meeting, the members were apprised of\na disposition on the part of the Board of Governors to approve an\nincrease of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate that was pending\nat several Federal Reserve Banks. In the event that such an increase\nwas approved by the Board, the members agreed that open market\noperations should be conducted so as to allow that increase to be\nreflected fully in reserve markets.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they could support a directive that called for\nincreasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions. In\nthe implementation of this policy, account would be taken of a\npossible increase of 1/2 percentage in the discount rate that was\nunder consideration by the Board of Governors. The members also\nagreed that the directive should not include any presumption about\npossible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve\nrestraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.\nAccording to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at\nthis meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3\nover coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting\nsuggests a strong further rise in economic activity\nduring the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll\nemployment was up considerably further in December\nafter a sharp increase in November, and the\ncivilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent.\nIndustrial production registered another large\nadvance in December and capacity utilization\ncontinued to move up from already high levels.\nCurrent estimates indicate little change in retail\nsales over November and December, while housing\nstarts posted sizable gains on balance over the two\nmonths. Orders for nondefense capital goods point\nto a continued strong expansion in spending on\nbusiness equipment; permits for nonresidential\nconstruction have been trending appreciably higher.\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and\nservices widened somewhat in October-November from\nits average rate in the third quarter. Prices of\nmany materials have continued to move up rapidly,\nbut broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and\nservices have increased moderately on average over\nrecent months.\n\nMost market interest rates have declined\nslightly on balance since the Committee meeting on\nDecember 20, 1994. In foreign exchange markets,\nthe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of\nthe other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat\nover the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has\ndepreciated sharply against the dollar.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December\nand January. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at a rate at\nthe bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3\nat a rate in the lower half of its range for the\nyear. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has\ncontinued to expand at a moderate rate in recent\nmonths, and for the year 1994 it grew at a rate in\nthe lower half of its monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks\nmonetary and financial conditions that will foster\nprice stability and promote sustainable growth in\noutput. In furtherance of these objectives, the\nCommittee at this meeting established ranges for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4\npercent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The\nCommittee anticipated that money growth within\nthese ranges would be consistent with its broad\npolicy objectives. The monitoring range for growth\nof total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to\n3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the\nimmediate future, the Committee seeks to increase\nsomewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions, taking account of a possible increase in\nthe discount rate. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or\nsomewhat lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action : Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow,\nMses. Phillips and Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nTemporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with the Bank of\nMexico and Increase in Agreement to \"Warehouse\" Foreign Currencies\n\nOn December 30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary\nincrease from $3 billion to $4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal\ncurrency (swap) agreement with the Bank of Mexico and it also approved\nthe activation of that agreement. The Committee approved a further\ntemporary increase of $1-1/2 billion and activation of that amount at\nthis meeting, thereby raising the swap arrangement with the Bank of\nMexico to a level of $6 billion, consisting of the regular $3 billion\nline and a special $3 billion line. The special $3 billion line may\nbe drawn on until January 31, 1996. Drawings would be for three-month\nperiods and could be renewed a maximum of three times. Once a drawing\non the special line is repaid, the size of the line will be reduced\npari passu. All drawings on the special line will have to be repaid\nno later than January 31, 1997. The terms and conditions for use of\nthe permanent $3 billion swap facility with the Bank of Mexico remain\nunchanged and drawings, once repaid, will require Committee action\nprior to subsequent use. The Treasury has undertaken to assure the\nrepayment of any swap drawing by the Bank of Mexico on the $6 billion\nin lines that is outstanding more than 12 months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,\nMs. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVotes against this action : Messrs.\nLindsey and Melzer.\n\nThe Committee also approved at this meeting an increase from\n$5 billion to $20 billion in the amount of eligible foreign currencies\nthat the System is prepared to \"warehouse\" for the Treasury and the\nExchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of the warehousing\nfacility, which has been in place for many years, is to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF for financing\npurchases of foreign currencies and related international operations.\nThe size of the warehousing facility had ranged up to $15 billion in\npast years, but it was reduced to $5 billion in February 1992. The\nexpansion of the warehousing agreement at this meeting was intended to\nfacilitate U.S. participation in the Multilateral Program to Restore\nFinancial Stability in Mexico, announced by President Clinton on\nJanuary 31, 1995, by warehousing up to $20 billion in German marks and\nJapanese yen held by the Treasury through the ESF. The Committee will\nreview each year the need to maintain this level of warehousing\nauthority in light of the progress and needs of the Program.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,\nMs. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs.\nLindsey and Melzer.\n\nMembers who voted to approve these proposals were persuaded\nthat the nature and severity of Mexico's financial problems could not\nbe contained without making available substantial financial assistance\nto the Government of Mexico. The financial support provided by the\nUnited States would be accompanied by similar assistance from the IMF\nand would be conditioned on Mexico's commitment to implement major\nchanges in its economic policies, including monetary policy. It was\nemphasized during the Committee's discussion that the United States\nhad a strong interest in encouraging the restoration of stability in\nMexico for numerous reasons, including the growth of trade between the\ntwo nations and the resulting creation of jobs in both countries.\nMoreover, Mexico's financial problems appeared to be spreading to a\nnumber of other nations and adversely affecting the dollar in the\nforeign exchange markets. The participation of the Federal Reserve in\nthis effort was strongly endorsed by the Administration and the\noverall program had the support of the bipartisan leadership in the\nCongress. Apart from temporary financial resources, the Federal\nReserve was in a position to supply expertise and experience that were\nnot readily available elsewhere. On the negative side, the members\nacknowledged that there could be no assurances that the rescue program\nwould succeed, but its scale, its multinational character, and the\napparent willingness of Mexican officials to pursue the difficult\npolicies needed to assure success were grounds for optimism.\n\nMessrs. Lindsey and Melzer dissented with respect to\nincreases in both the swap line and the warehousing arrangement with\nthe Exchange Stabilization Fund. They did not believe that the\nCommittee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether\ndevelopments in Mexico threatened U.S. financial stability, a possible\njustification for increased central bank lending on a short-term\nbasis, Furthermore, they considered it inappropriate for the Federal\nReserve to participate, directly or indirectly, in intermediate to\nlong-term financing to facilitate debt restructuring. They were\nconcerned that such participation in a fiscal policy matter might\ncompromise, or appear to compromise, the independence of the monetary\npolicy process. Mr. Lindsey added that the latter risks were\nsignificantly enhanced given the absence of Congressional\nauthorization or more general public support for these measures.\n\nDisclosure Policy.\n\nAt this meeting, the Committee decided to retain the procedures that it had followed over the past year for providing greater\ninformation to the public about its policy actions and discussions.\nIt was the judgment of the members that these procedures strike an\nappropriate balance between making the Committee's decisions and\ndeliberations accessible to the public as soon and as fully as\nfeasible, while safeguarding the Committee's flexibility in policymaking and preserving an unfettered deliberative process. The\nprocedures in question involve the prompt announcement of the\nCommittee's decisions and the release of minutes and transcripts of\nFOMC meetings.\n\nThe Committee will continue its practice of announcing each\nchange in the stance of monetary policy in a press release on the day\nthe decision is made. This practice removes any uncertainty about the\nCommittee's intentions in regard to reserve conditions and enables all\nfinancial market participants and others to receive the information at\nthe same time. When no change is made at a meeting, the Committee\nnormally will announce only the time when the meeting ended and that\nthere are no further announcements. However, in some infrequent\ncircumstances, the Committee may decide to issue a statement even when\nno change in policy is made.\n\nThe full substance of the Committee's deliberations relating\nto each policy decision will continue to be reported, as is the\ncurrent practice, in comprehensive minutes of the meeting that are\nreleased two or three days following the next regularly scheduled\nmeeting. For historians and other students of monetary policymaking,\nthose minutes will be supplemented by lightly edited transcripts of\nthe discussion at each Committee meeting. For recent and future\nmeetings, transcripts for an entire year will be released with a five-year lag; earlier transcripts dating back to March 1976 will continue\nto be released on an ongoing basis as the light editing process is\ncompleted. Continuing the practice followed since the beginning of\n1994, transcripts prepared by the Committee's Secretariat will be\ncirculated to each participant to verify his or her comments, and only\nchanges that clarify meaning, such as the correction of grammar or\ntranscription errors, will be permitted. A limited amount of material\nwill be withheld from the publicly released version of these\ndocuments, primarily to protect the confidentiality of foreign and\ndomestic sources of information that likely would be lost if the\ninformation they provide were to be made public. As required by law,\na complete, unredacted version of the transcript of each meeting will\nbe turned over to the National Archives after 30 years have elapsed.\n\nFor the purpose of preparing the minutes and transcripts, the\ndiscussions of monetary policy at Committee meetings will continue to\nbe recorded. The tape recorder may be turned off at the Chairman's\ndiscretion when the Committee deals with issues unrelated to monetary\npolicy, such as organizational and personnel matters. The transcripts\nwill indicate that the tape recorder has been turned off and the\nminutes will provide a summary description of the matters that were\ndiscussed, As permitted by the National Records Act, the recordings\nand unedited transcripts will be discarded after all the participants\nat the meeting have reviewed and corrected, as necessary, the\ntranscripts prepared by the Secretariat.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, March 28, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 3:20 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
