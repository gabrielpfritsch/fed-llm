Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on July 6-7, 1993, were approved.\n\nSecretary's Note: Advice had been received of the election\nof William J. McDonough by the Board of Directors of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York as a member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee for the period commencing July 19,\n1993, and ending December 31, 1993, and that he had executed\nhis oath of office.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee elected William J. McDonough\nas Vice Chairman of the Committee to serve until the first meeting of\nthe Committee after December 31, 1993.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments in foreign exchange markets during the period since the July meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period July 7, 1993, through August 16, 1993. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\nand financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed by the Committee suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. The limited data\navailable for the third quarter presented a mixed picture but on\nbalance pointed to continued expansion in consumption, business fixed\ninvestment, and homebuilding. Employment remained on an uptrend, and\nindustrial production recently had firmed somewhat. After rising at a\nfaster rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices had changed\nlittle and producer prices had fallen in recent months.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment, after a small gain in June,\nexpanded in July at a rate close to its average advance in earlier\nmonths of the year. The services industries, led by business\nservices, provided half of the July increase. Elsewhere, considerable\nhiring was evident in wholesale and retail trade, and construction\nemployment moved up after a small decline in June. In manufacturing,\nmore jobs were lost, although at a slower rate than earlier in the\nyear. The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 6.8 percent in July.\n\nIndustrial production recovered in July from small declines\nin May and June. Manufacturing output rose in spite of a sizable\ncutback in motor vehicle assemblies: utility production registered a\nstrong weather-related gain; and mining output declined further. Within manufacturing, the production of consumer durable goods other\nthan automobiles and trucks rebounded in July, and the output of\nbusiness equipment advanced further. Total utilization of industrial\ncapacity edged higher in July, reflecting a substantial gain at\nelectric utilities: utilization of manufacturing capacity was\nunchanged.\n\nRetail sales increased slightly further in July after a\nsizable rise in the second quarter. Spending on automobiles was down\nfor a second straight month, but sales were strong at apparel,\nfurniture and appliance, and general merchandise stores. Total\nhousing starts, depressed by wet weather and floods in some areas of\nthe country, were down somewhat in July; however, permit issuance\nmoved up, suggesting that homebuilding activity remained in a mild\nuptrend. In addition, consumer surveys indicated that attitudes\ntoward homebuying continued to be strongly positive during July, and\nbuilders' assessments of home sales improved substantially.\n\nBusiness fixed investment increased in the second quarter at\nabout the rapid pace of the first quarter. Business spending for\nequipment remained strong, with solid increases in business purchases\nof motor vehicles, computers, and a wide range of machinery and\nequipment. However, outlays for aircraft declined in the second\nquarter, retracing some of the substantial first-quarter rise. The\nlimited information available for the third quarter pointed to some\nslowing of the growth of business spending for equipment. In the\nsecond quarter, nonresidential building activity posted its largest\nadvance in three years. Expenditures were up across a broad array of\ncategories, with investment in institutional and public utilities\nstructures being particularly strong.\n\nBusiness inventories expanded moderately during the second\nquarter, and inventory accumulation was broadly in line with sales\nover the first half of the year. In manufacturing, stocks edged lower\nin June, reflecting a further decline in inventories held by aircraft\nproducers. Outside of the aircraft industry, inventory changes were\nmixed. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of inventories to\nshipments fell in June to one of the lowest levels in recent years.\nIn the wholesale trade sector, inventories expanded modestly in June,\nand with sales lower, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector\nincreased slightly. Retail inventories, after changing little in May,\nrose slightly more than sales in June, and the stocks-to-sales ratio\nfor the retail sector remained near the high end of its range for the\npast several years.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was considerably\nsmaller in May than the deficits recorded in March and April: however,\nthe deficit for April and May combined was larger than the average\nrate for the first quarter. The value of exports rose slightly in\nMay; increases in sales abroad of industrial supplies, machinery, and\nconsumer goods offset declines in agricultural products, civilian\naircraft, and motor vehicles and parts. A drop in the value of\nimports was spread across a wide range of products, particularly\nautomotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The economic performance of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the second\nquarter. Output continued to decline in western Germany, and economic\nactivity in Japan appeared to have stalled after modest growth in the\nfirst quarter. In contrast, economic recovery continued in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods declined in July for a\nsecond consecutive month. Prices of finished foods edged lower, and prices of finished energy goods, particularly gasoline and fuel oil\nfell significantly; excluding the food and energy components, producer\nprices edged up in July and to that point in the year had risen at a\nslightly lower rate than was recorded in 1992. At the consumer level,\nprices for nonfood, non-energy items were up slightly in both June and\nJuly and for the year to date had increased a little more slowly than\nlast year. Hourly compensation for private industry workers rose in\nthe second quarter at about the rate seen last year. Average hourly\nearnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged on\nbalance over June and July, but for the year through July these\nearnings had increased at the same pace as in 1992.\n\nAt its meeting on July 6-7, 1993, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that retained a tilt toward possible firming\nof reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly,\nthe directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,\nand giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nor slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with modest growth of the\nbroader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.\n\nThroughout the intermeeting period, open market operations\nwere directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on\nreserve positions. Two upward revisions were made to expected levels\nof adjustment plus seasonal borrowing in anticipation of further\nincreases in demand for seasonal credit. Borrowing averaged close to expected levels over most of the intermeeting interval, and the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent.\n\nMoney market interest rates were little changed on balance\nover the intermeeting period, while rates on intermediate-term U.S.\nTreasury obligations and on fixed-rate mortgages dropped slightly.\nYields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds were down by more,\nwith the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond falling below 6-1/2\npercent. Many market interest rates moved higher after Chairman\nGreenspan's congressional testimony on July 20, which was perceived by\nmarket participants as suggesting a greater likelihood of some\ntightening of monetary policy in the future. Subsequently, interest\nrates generally retreated in reaction to incoming economic data\nindicating subdued inflation pressures and to the passage of the\ndeficit-reduction legislation. Major indexes of stock prices\nincreased somewhat over the intermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. The dollar strengthened\nslightly against the German mark, but it rose by significantly more\nagainst most other European currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nin the aftermath of a widening of the margins within which participating currencies are allowed to fluctuate relative to each other.\nThe widening, which was in response to massive selling pressures on\nthe French franc and several other currencies, followed sharp\nincreases in short-term interest rates in the affected countries.\nWith exchange market participants continuing to focus on Japan's trade\nsurplus, the dollar fell substantially against the yen.\n\nM2 expanded only slightly in July after growing appreciably over the second quarter. The continued strength of inflows to bond and stock mutual funds suggested that households were still realigning\ntheir portfolios toward assets outside the monetary aggregates.\nThrough July, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate close to the\nlower end of the Committee's range for the year. M3 contracted\nslightly in June and July, owing in part to a substantial drop in\ninstitution-only money market mutual funds, whose returns had not kept\npace with the increase in money market rates in late spring. In\naddition, depository institutions placed greater reliance on various\nnondeposit sources of funds, including the issuance of equity and\nsubordinated debt. Through July, M3 had declined a little and was\nslightly below its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had\nexpanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through\nJune was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of\nthe Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested\nmoderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins\nof unemployed labor and capital through next year. The fiscal\nrestraint stemming from the recent legislation and uncertainty about\nother government policies would act as a drag on the economy. On the\nother hand, lower interest rates were expected to contribute to\nfurther gains in spending on consumer durables, housing, and business\nfixed investment. Continued expansion also would be supported by\nfurther improvements in the availability of credit, a small boost to\nproduction over the next several quarters associated with rebuilding\nactivity in areas of the Midwest affected by the recent floods, and a\npickup in foreign demand resulting from some strengthening in economic\nactivity abroad. The projected slack in labor and product markets,\ncoupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to\nfoster modest further reductions in wage and price inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not materially\naltered the outlook for moderate and sustained growth in economic\nactivity. Despite widespread indications of pessimistic consumer and\nbusiness attitudes, overall consumer spending and business investment\nappeared to be reasonably well maintained. Likewise, the outlook for\nincreased fiscal restraint associated with the recently enacted\ndeficit-reduction legislation needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on spending of reduced interest rates in intermediate-\nand long-term debt markets, the improved balance sheets of consumers\nand businesses, and the indications of a somewhat better availability\nof loans from financial intermediaries. In an environment of moderate\neconomic growth, the fundamentals bearing on the outlook for inflation\nwere consistent with further disinflation, and the members drew some\nencouragement from consumer and producer price developments in recent\nmonths. Several cautioned, however, that recent price measures\nprobably overstated the reduction in inflation, just as the surge in\nprices earlier in the year seemed to have overstated the underlying\ninflation trend. Members also referred to the persistence of\ninflationary expectations among business executives and consumers.\nThus, while the rise in inflation appeared to have been arrested, any\nfurther progress toward price stability was likely to be limited over\nthe quarters ahead.\n\nBusiness contacts and other sources of information suggested\nlittle change since the July meeting in the pace or composition of\neconomic activity in different parts of the country. Descriptions of\neconomic performance varied from slow to moderate growth in most\nregions, though business activity probably continued to weaken\nin some major areas such as California. Despite sustained, if not ebullient, growth in sales to consumers and the relative strength in\nbusiness investment spending in the first half of this year, business\nsentiment was widely described as cautious or negative even in some regions whose economies were outperforming the nation as a whole.\nAccording to business contacts, the recent enactment of deficit-reduction legislation had tended to mitigate concerns about the size\nof future federal deficits, but business executives were now focusing\non the implications of higher taxes and many were expressing\napprehension about further though still unannounced tax increases that\nmight be associated with health care reform. Business sentiment and\nsales also were being affected adversely in many areas by cutbacks in\ndefense contracts and closings of military installations and by the\nweakness in foreign demand for some products.\n\nWith regard to developments and prospects in key sectors of\nthe economy, members noted that despite further survey indications of\neroding consumer confidence, consumer expenditures had strengthened in\nrecent months after a pause earlier in the year. The pickup had\nfeatured rising sales of motor vehicles, and while the latter had\nslipped recently, a number of special factors such as shortages of\npopular models at the end of the model year and the effects of\nflooding in some parts of the Midwest suggested the need to withhold\njudgment on any downward shift in the underlying demand for motor\nvehicles. Tourism was reported to have strengthened considerably in\nmany areas this summer, though there were major exceptions. As had\nbeen true for an extended period, consumer attitudes continued to be\ninhibited by concerns about employment opportunities, especially given\nfurther reductions in defense spending, the ongoing restructuring and\nrelated downsizing of many business operations, and the continuing\nefforts by business firms to limit the number of their permanent employees in order to hold down the rising costs of health care and\nother nonwage worker benefits. Members noted, however, that the\ngrowth in employment thus far this year, while tending to involve many\nlow paying jobs, had greatly exceeded the rate of expansion in 1992.\nIn the view of at least some members, appreciable further growth was\nlikely as business firms found it increasingly difficult in an\nexpanding economy to meet growing demands through outsourcing,\ntemporary workers, and overtime work. Some members also noted that\nthe newly legislated taxes on higher incomes would tend to curtail\nsome consumer spending. The timing of that effect was uncertain; tax\nliabilities had already risen, but some payments on the added tax\nliabilities were not due until April of 1994 and 1995.\n\nMembers anticipated that building activity, notably housing\nconstruction, would provide some stimulus to the expansion. Although\nindicators of housing activity were somewhat mixed for the nation as a\nwhole, sales of new and existing homes were brisk in many regions\nand even sales of second homes were reported to be improving in some\nareas. Prospective homebuyers continued to exercise considerable\ncaution, but reductions in mortgage rates and generally improved\naffordability pointed to rising housing sales and construction over\nthe quarters ahead. In the nonresidential sector, there was growing\nevidence of some strengthening in the construction of commercial and\ninstitutional structures, but overcapacity was likely to depress the\nconstruction of new office buildings for an extended period in most\nparts of the country. In some areas, infrastructure and other\nrebuilding associated with the recent floods was likely to stimulate\nsome construction activity later this year.\n\nWith regard to the external sector of the economy, the\nmembers again noted a somewhat mixed picture. Exporters from some parts of the country continued to report relatively brisk sales\nabroad, but many domestic producers were expressing concerns about\nweak markets in key foreign nations. Against the background of more\nstimulative economic policies in a number of those countries, some\noverall strengthening in the major foreign economies was viewed as a\nreasonable expectation, but the overall growth in exports was likely\nto lag the anticipated expansion in imports over the projection\nhorizon. The North American Free Trade Agreement now under consideration in the Congress was a topic of active discussion among business\ncontacts, and the uncertain outcome of that treaty was a matter of\nconcern in several parts of the country.\n\nMembers observed that the more favorable performance of key\nmeasures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier\nconcerns about a possible worsening of inflation. However, because\nthe recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the\ntrend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they\npointed to renewed disinflation. In any event, a number of\nfundamental factors appeared to have favorable implications for the\ninflation outlook, notably the prospect that some slack in labor and\ncapital resources would persist in the context of projections that\npointed to a relatively moderate rate of economic expansion. Members\ncontinued to cite reports from numerous business firms regarding their\ninability to raise prices because of the highly competitive markets in\nwhich those firms had to operate. Many business contacts also\nreferred to the absence of significant increases--and indeed to\noccasional decreases--in the costs of their outside purchases. Oil\nprice developments in world markets and the ongoing competition from\nforeign producers also were noted as favorable elements in the outlook\nfor inflation. On the negative side, adverse weather conditions in recent months including severe floods in the Midwest appeared to have\nfostered some upward pressure on food prices, and higher taxes would\nraise gasoline prices in the fourth quarter. Perhaps of greater\nsignificance, business contacts and surveys of households indicated\npersisting expectations that inflation would rise at some point. In\nthis connection, however, passage of the federal deficit-reduction\nlegislation and the Committee's reaffirmation in its directive and in\ncongressional testimony of its commitment to price stability seemed to\nhave had a constructive effect on attitudes in financial markets and\non long-term interest rates, and these developments could prove to be harbingers of more favorable inflation attitudes more generally.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, the members agreed that recent developments pointed to\nthe desirability of a steady policy course. While economic growth did\nnot seem particularly robust, neither was it clear that a disinflationary trend had been reestablished. Many members observed that real\nshort-term interest rates were at very low levels, indeed slightly\nnegative by some calculations, and while real intermediate- and long-term interest rates were higher, it was apparent that monetary policy\nwas in an accommodative posture. This conclusion was seen as\nreinforcing the view that monetary policy probably would have to move\nin the direction of restraint at some point to resist any incipient\ntendency for inflationary pressures to intensify. For now, the\nrelatively slow economic expansion in the first half of the year, the\nfiscal restraint associated with the deficit-reduction legislation,\nother obstacles to economic growth, and the encouraging inflation\nstatistics for recent months argued against any near-term policy\nadjustment.\n\nMoreover, there was no compelling evidence that current\nmonetary policy was fostering credit flows usually associated with\nspeculative excesses or impending increases in price pressures.\nGrowth in the broad measures of money and in the debt of nonfinancial\nsectors remained fairly damped despite indications of greater willingness to supply credit by banks, other financial intermediaries, and\ninvestors in securities markets. With regard to the monetary aggregates, low short-term interest rates undoubtedly were contributing to\nlarge shifts of funds from depository institutions, notably from\ncomponents of M2 and M3 to stock and bond mutual funds and to other\nfinancial instruments, and thus to the sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money. In this connection, a staff analysis pointed to\ncontinuing slow growth in M2 over the near term and, on the assumption of little or no change in the degree of pressure on reserve\npositions, to growth for the year at a rate around the lower end of\nthe Committee's range. Growth in M3 was likely to fall marginally\nbelow the Committee's range for the year. On the other hand, growth\nin Ml and in various reserve measures was expected to remain\nrelatively robust.\n\nTurning to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period ahead, the members endorsed a proposal to return to an\nunbiased intermeeting instruction that did not incorporate any\npresumption with regard to the direction of possible intermeeting\npolicy changes. The members agreed that the probability of an\nintermeeting policy adjustment was relatively remote. Incoming data\non economic activity and prices had reduced concerns that inflation\nand inflationary expectations might be worsening. The Committee\nretained its fundamental objectives of fostering economic expansion at\na sustainable pace that was consistent with further progress over time toward stable prices. However, it now appeared less likely than at the time of the May and July meetings that the Committee needed to bias its consideration of responses to incoming information in the intermeeting period toward possible tightening in order to achieve those objectives. One member, while agreeing that a tightening move\nwould not be appropriate under current circumstances, nonetheless believed that monetary policy had been overly stimulative for some time and that the Committee should move toward restraint at the first favorable opportunity.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers expressed a preference for a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.\nThey also indicated their support of a directive that did not include\na presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nslightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmodest growth in M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of\nthe third quarter.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased in July at a\nrate close to its average advance in earlier months of\nthe year, and the civilian unemployment rate declined\nto 6.8 percent. Industrial production turned up in\nJuly after posting small declines in May and June.\nRetail sales edged higher in July following a sizable\nrise in the second quarter. Housing starts were down\nsomewhat in July, but permits moved up. Available\nindicators point to continued expansion in business\ncapital spending. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade\ndeficit declined in May, but for April and May combined\nit was larger than its average rate in the first\nquarter. After rising at a faster rate in the early\npart of the year, consumer prices have changed little\nand producer prices have fallen in recent months.\n\nShort-and intermediate-term interest rates have\nchanged little since the Committee meeting on July 6-7, while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds\nhave declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets,\nthe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the\nother G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nAfter expanding appreciably over the second\nquarter, M2 increased slightly further in July and M3\ndeclined. For the year through July, M2 is estimated\nto have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the\nCommittee's range for the year, and M3 at a rate\nslightly below its range. Total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months,\nand for the year through June it is estimated to have\nincreased at a rate in the lower half of the\nCommittee's monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July lowered the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the\nCommittee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary\ngrowth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and\n0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set\nthe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith modest growth in M2 and little net change in M3\nover the balance of the third quarter.\n\nVotes for this action : Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, McTeer, Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nFOMC"
