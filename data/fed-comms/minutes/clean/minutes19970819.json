Gavin, Kahn, and Ms. Perelmuter, Vice\nPresidents, Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis,\nKansas City, and New York respectively\n\nMs. Little and Mr. Sullivan, Assistant Vice\nPresidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and\nChicago respectively\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee elected Mr. Stephen G.\nCecchetti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as Associate\nEconomist to serve until the election of his successor at the first\nmeeting of the Committee after December 31, 1997. It was understood\nthat in the event of the discontinuance of his official connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he would cease to have any\nofficial connection with the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets since the meeting in early\nJuly. There were no System open market transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period July 2,\n1997, through August 18, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding moderately. Growth in consumer\nspending had picked up after having slowed sharply in early spring,\nbusiness purchases of durable equipment were still on a strong upward\ntrend, and housing demand seemed to have been well maintained. The\noverall rise in production had been held down recently by supply\ndisruptions in the motor vehicles industry, but employment had\ncontinued to expand at a strong pace and the unemployment rate was at\na low level. Increases in labor compensation had remained moderate\neven though labor markets were tight, and price inflation was still\nsubdued.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in July after\na June increase that was below the average for earlier months of the\nyear. The step-up in job growth in July reflected substantially\nlarger job gains in business services, retail trade, and the finance,\ninsurance, and real estate industries. A small decline in\nmanufacturing jobs roughly offset slightly higher employment in\nconstruction. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July,\nmatched its low for the current economic expansion.\n\nIndustrial production increased relatively slowly in July\nafter having advanced at a fairly brisk pace over the first half of\nthe year. The July slowdown reflected a temporary drop in motor\nvehicle assemblies partly associated with work stoppages at a major\nautomotive manufacturer. Outside the motor vehicles sector, the\noutput of business equipment and consumer durable goods rose strongly\nwhile the production of consumer nondurables weakened further.\nFactory capacity increased a little more than production in July, and\nthe utilization of total manufacturing capacity slipped to its lowest\nlevel since last autumn.\n\nRetail sales rose briskly in June and July after having\nchanged little over the preceding three months. Sales at automotive\ndealers rebounded in June and July following substantial weakness in\nearlier months, and expenditures at nondurable goods stores also\nstrengthened. By contrast, sales at non-automotive durable goods\noutlets were unchanged over June and July. The pickup in consumer\nspending occurred against a backdrop of further strong gains in\nincomes and household net worth. In addition, credit was readily\navailable to most consumers, although lenders continued to tighten\nterms for marginal borrowers. Total private housing starts were\nunchanged in July after having rebounded in June from a May decline.\nData on home sales in recent months continued to suggest that demand\nfor single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.\n\nReal business fixed investment increased substantially\nfurther in the second quarter, reflecting a broad-based surge in\nspending on producers' durable equipment. Real outlays for office and\ncomputing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal\ncomputers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.\nSpending for communications equipment grew at a slower pace in the\nsecond quarter, but recent orders for such equipment pointed to larger\nincreases in the current quarter. Nonresidential construction\nactivity was sluggish in the second quarter. While available\ninformation on construction contracts suggested little improvement in\nbuilding activity in coming months, prices for commercial real estate\nhad risen slightly and vacancy rates had declined.\n\nNonfarm business inventories increased rapidly in the second\nquarter, but there were few signs of inventory imbalances. In June,\nthe pace of inventory investment in manufacturing slowed from the\nrapid average rate for April and May, and the inventory-shipments\nratio for the sector was at a very low level. In wholesale trade,\nstocks rose sharply in June after little net change over the two\nprevious months. Despite the June increase, the stock-sales ratio was\nat the middle of its relatively narrow range of the past year. At the\nretail level, the rise in inventories in June retraced only part of\nthe May decline; the inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was\nnear the middle of its range for the last year.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was\nslightly smaller on balance over April and May than the downward-revised\naverage rate in the first quarter. Measured against their\nfirst-quarter levels, the value of exported goods and services grew\nmore than the value of imports over the April-May period. The largest\nincreases in exports were in machinery and aircraft and parts, while\nthe biggest gains in imports were in consumer goods, computers, and\ncapital goods other than computers. The available information\nsuggested that in recent months economic activity had expanded further\nin all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan. Growth\ncontinued to be robust in Canada and the United Kingdom and apparently\nremained moderate in France and Germany. Economic activity in Japan\nhad slowed after a rise in that country's consumption tax in April.\n\nConsumer price inflation picked up slightly in July from the\nslow pace in each of the previous four months; a small decline in\nenergy prices offset a further increase in food prices. The index for\nitems other than food and energy rose in July at the same low rate\nrecorded for both the first six months of 1997 and the twelve months\nended in July. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged\ndown for a seventh consecutive month, reflecting a further drop in\nfood prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy were\nunchanged over the twelve months ended in July. At earlier stages of\nproduction, producer prices for core intermediate materials rose\nslightly over the year ended in July and prices of core crude\nmaterials increased by a larger amount over the same period. Growth\nin hourly compensation of private industry workers picked up somewhat\nin the second quarter, but the rise in compensation over the year\nended in June matched the advance over the comparable year-earlier\nperiod. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers were unchanged in July, and the rise in such earnings over the\ntwelve months ended in July also was the same as in the year-earlier\nperiod.\n\nAt its meeting on July 1-2, 1997, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions. Because the Committee continued to see a\npotential need for some tightening of monetary policy to counter\nrising inflationary pressures, the directive included a bias toward a\npossible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.\nThe reserve market conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting\nperiod toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on\nreserve positions, and the average federal funds rate for the period\nwas at the Committee's intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other\nmarket interest rates declined further on balance over the period in\nan atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets. The net\ndecline in market rates seemed to have reflected a judgment by market\nparticipants that the outlook for inflation had improved slightly on\nbalance and that the likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy\nin coming months had receded a little further. Share prices in equity\nmarkets increased on balance over the period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose significantly on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. The appreciation of the dollar\nwas uneven against the currencies of the major foreign industrial\ncountries. The dollar's substantial increase against the German mark\nand other continental European countries reflected both the continuing\nfavorable developments in the U.S. economy and persisting market\nconcerns that difficulties faced by the major European countries would\nlead to policies that might detract from strength in the euro. The\ndollar rose only slightly against the yen. That currency came under\ndownward pressure in reaction to incoming data suggesting a somewhat-\ngreater-than-expected falloff in demand following the recent increase\nin the consumption tax, but the release of the June current account\nsurplus late in the intermeeting period rekindled market concerns\nabout Japanese external balances and led to some appreciation of the\nyen.\n\nM2 expanded at a moderate pace over June and July after\nhaving fluctuated sharply in April and May as a result of tax-related\nflows. Data for early August suggested a somewhat faster rate of M2\ngrowth in association with heavier inflows to retail money funds; the\nlatter might have been related to heightened demand for liquidity as a\nresult of recently higher volatility in bond and equity markets. For\nthe year through July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of\nits range. M3 also fluctuated sharply over April and May and grew at\na relatively moderate rate in June. M3 surged in July, however, as\nheavy volumes of large time deposits were issued by U.S. branches of\nforeign banks to pay down borrowings from their overseas offices and\nby domestic banks to counter the runoff of government deposit\naccounts; the latter two sources of funds are not included in M3. For\nthe year through July, M3 expanded at a rate appreciably above the\nupper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had\ncontinued to expand in recent months at a rate near the middle of its\nrange.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion of the economy would be damped in the second half of the\nyear by a slowing of inventory accumulation from the unsustainably\nbrisk pace in the first half of the year. In 1998, the economy would\nexpand at a pace in line with the growth of its estimated potential.\nGrowth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household\nwealth and projected further gains in employment and income, was\nexpected to be relatively brisk over the forecast horizon. Business\nspending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to\noutpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential\nwould tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual\ndiminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in\nconjunction with moderating economic growth. Housing construction was\nprojected to drift lower over the forecast horizon. The staff\nanticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint\non the expansion of economic activity. With labor compensation\ngradually accelerating in the context of higher resource utilization,\ncore consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher.\n\nThe Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments highlighted statistical and anecdotal evidence\nof a solid economic performance, including indications of a rebound in\nfinal demand after a lull during the spring and the persistence of\nrelatively subdued, and by some measures declining, inflation. Growth\nin consumer spending had slowed sharply and a surge in inventory\naccumulation had accounted for much of the expansion of economic\nactivity in the second quarter. Looking ahead, the members did not\nbelieve that recent developments had altered the prospect that the\neconomy would settle into a pattern of moderate growth approximating\nits potential. Such a forecast was subject to considerable\nuncertainty, and several members observed that the risks appeared to\nbe mostly in the direction of stronger growth in demand. With regard\nto the outlook for inflation, widespread evidence of very tight labor\nmarkets was associated with scattered indications that the rise in\nlabor compensation might be accelerating, but overall labor costs had\nremained relatively damped and price inflation restrained. Gains in\nproductivity and muted increases in nonlabor costs probably also were\ncontributing to holding producer costs under good control.\nNonetheless, the members remained concerned about the risks of rising\ninflation, especially if somewhat-faster-than-projected growth in\neconomic activity were to occur and add to pressures on resources in\nan economy that already seemed to be operating close to, or perhaps\neven above, its sustainable potential.\n\nThe uncertain prospects for inventory investment were a\ndominant factor in the outlook for economic activity over the nearer\nterm. The accumulation of inventories had been unusually high in the\nsecond quarter according to the available evidence. There was no\nbroad sense of an undesired buildup, but the rate of inventory\ninvestment would have to be reined in if an overhang were to be\naverted. A concern in this regard was that the apparent upturn in\nfinal demand, particularly if it proved to be somewhat stronger than\ncurrently expected, and related business optimism about sales\nprospects might well result in a further buildup of inventories at a\nrelatively rapid rate. While such a development was not viewed as the\nmost likely outcome and, indeed, less-than-projected strength in the\ninventory sector could not be ruled out, relatively rapid inventory\naccumulation in the context of persisting above-trend growth in final\ndemand would generate additional pressure on resources and heighten\nthe risks of accelerating inflation.\n\nWith regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors\nof the economy, members noted that the appreciable rebound in consumer\nspending followed a weak second quarter, and some moderation in the\ngrowth of such spending was likely later this year and in 1998. Even\nso, favorable prospects for employment and incomes and the large gains\nthat had occurred in financial wealth suggested that consumer\nexpenditures were likely to be well maintained over the projection\nhorizon. The high level of consumer confidence reported by consumer\nsurveys was another supporting factor in this favorable outlook.\n\nIn the area of business fixed investment, a strong upward\ntrend in outlays for new equipment was thought likely to persist,\nnotably in the computer-related and the telecommunications industries.\nAnecdotal reports also pointed to appreciable strength in commercial\nconstruction activity, including office structures, hotels, and\nwarehouses in various parts of the country. Indeed, in some areas\nconstruction activity was said to be limited only by shortages of\nqualified labor. Positive factors in the outlook for business\ninvestment included the persistence of a high level of profits, an\naccommodative financial climate, and the rapid obsolescence of high-tech\nequipment. There were, nonetheless, indications of some\nmoderation in commercial construction activity in a number of areas,\nincluding reports of developing overcapacity of retail space in\nshopping centers. Spending for basic industrial equipment also was\nlikely to soften, given moderating growth in overall final demand in\nline with current forecasts.\n\nHousing activity continued to display considerable vigor in\nmany parts of the nation as evidenced by available statistics and\nanecdotal reports. The affordability of housing and the very large\nincreases that had occurred in stock market wealth clearly were\nsupportive factors. Concurrently, however, there were indications of\nslowing in residential building activity in several areas. On\nbalance, some moderation in housing construction appeared likely over\nthe projection horizon in keeping with longer-term population and\nother trends affecting such construction.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation,\nmembers commented that a number of factors could be cited to explain\nthe persistence of relatively subdued inflation this year despite high\nlevels of resource use. Among those factors were the appreciation of\nthe dollar and its effects on prices of imports and competing domestic\nproducts, a significant decline in world oil prices, the relatively\nsluggish performance of many foreign economies that had tended to\nmoderate prices of products traded in world markets, and relatively\nlarge grain harvests in the United States that had curbed pressures on\nfood prices. However, the underlying reasons for the favorable price\ntrends were not entirely clear. Labor costs were still rising\nappreciably less than would have been expected on the basis of past\nexperience under similarly tight labor market conditions. Explanations\ntended to focus on the concerns about job security felt by many\nworkers, the muted rise in the costs of worker benefits, notably for\nhealth care, and the increased use of innovative and highly targeted\nmethods of compensation. With regard to the market pricing of goods,\nbusinesses tended to cite highly competitive conditions across the\nnation that made it very difficult to raise prices and gave impetus to\nefforts to improve productivity. Indeed, the available evidence\nsuggested that the profits of business concerns generally had\ncontinued to increase in the second quarter, implying that\nproductivity had been rising at a pace that exceeded published\nestimates by a significant margin.\n\nEven though inflation had not accelerated, some signs were\nbeginning to emerge that wages and other labor costs might be\nexperiencing increasing pressure. These included some limited\nevidence that job security concerns might be diminishing and\nmultiplying anecdotal reports of a less benign outlook for health care\ncosts. Some members commented that the outcome of the recent labor\nnegotiations involving a very large package delivery firm might well\nbe a harbinger of more militant labor negotiating attitudes. Against\nthis background, members expressed concern that a further increase in\nlabor utilization rates could put substantial upward pressures on\nwages that eventually would work their way through to prices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged policy stance. Underlying economic conditions and the\noutlook for economic activity and inflation had changed little in\nrecent months. The most likely outcome of the current policy stance\nwas growth near potential and some pickup in inflation as the effects\nof special factors holding it down abated. For the present, monetary\npolicy appeared to be appropriately positioned to foster the\nCommittee's objectives of resisting an intensification of inflationary\npressures while supporting a fully employed economy. The level of\nreal short-term interest rates was relatively high by historical\nstandards and provided some assurance that the current stance of\npolicy would not accommodate a significant increase in underlying\ninflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the members remained concerned\nabout the outlook for inflation. Although some decline in inflation\ncould not be ruled out, persistence of the current degree of tightness\nin labor markets, consistent with the economy growing at a pace near\nits potential, could at some point begin to put more pressure on costs\nand prices, and growth somewhat above potential, which some members\nsaw as a distinct possibility, would be even more likely to produce\nthat result. While there were no current indications that inflation\nmight be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time,\nthe members saw a need for continuing vigilance. As at earlier\nmeetings, a number of them expressed the view that an anticipatory\npolicy move to counter intensifying inflationary pressures likely\nwould be needed at some point.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to\npolicy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the\nretention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent\nwith their view that the risks remained biased toward a rise in\ninflation. Accordingly, while they did not attach a high probability\nto the prospect that the incoming information would warrant a\ntightening move during the intermeeting period, they continued to view\nthe next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some\nfirming than toward easing.\n\nThe members reviewed proposals for rewording the operational\nparagraph of the directive for the purpose of updating and clarifying\nthe description of the Committee's instructions to the Manager of the\nSystem Open Market Account and to conform the directive wording with\ncurrent public announcement practices regarding the Committee's policy\ndecisions. In particular, the directive would in the future include\nspecific reference to the federal funds rate that the Committee judged\nto be consistent with the stance of monetary policy. The Committee\nalso modified the present sentence relating to the intermeeting bias\nin the directive to recognize that changes in the stance of policy are\nnow expressed in terms of the federal funds rate. These changes were\nnot intended to alter the substance of the directive or the\nCommittee's operating procedures.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers expressed their support of a directive that called for\nmaintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an\nunchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. All the members\nalso agreed on the desirability of retaining a bias in the directive\ntoward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal\nfunds rate during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a\nslightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with moderate expansion in M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMarket interest rates generally have declined\nsomewhat further since the start of the Committee meeting\non July 1-2, 1997. Share prices in equity markets have\nincreased on balance. In foreign exchange markets, the\ntrade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies rose significantly on balance over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nAfter fluctuating sharply from April to May, growth\nof M2 was at a moderate pace over June and July and that\nof M3 picked up to a relatively rapid rate. For the year\nthrough July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound\nof its range for the year and M3 at a rate appreciably\nabove the upper bound of its range. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent\nmonths at a rate near the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on\na tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for\ngrowth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\nto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\n: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow,\nParry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nVotes against this action : None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, September 30, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:40 p.m."
