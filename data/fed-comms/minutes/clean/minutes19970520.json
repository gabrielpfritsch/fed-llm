Cox, Rosengren, and Weber, Vice Presidents,\nFederal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Boston, and\nMinneapolis respectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets. The Desk did not\nconduct any transactions in foreign currencies for System Account\nduring the period since the latest meeting on March 25, 1997, and thus\nno vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period March 25,\n1997 through May 19, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion of economic activity had slowed after having surged in late\n1996 and earlier this year. Consumer spending appeared to be\nincreasing at a considerably slower pace after the spurt in the first\nquarter, while business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend,\nand the demand for housing seemed to be well maintained. Growth of\nlabor demand had moderated somewhat from the rapid pace at the\nbeginning of the year, but labor markets remained tight and worker\ncompensation appeared to be accelerating gradually. Despite the\nupward drift in labor costs, underlying price inflation was still\nsubdued.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment rose at a considerably\nreduced pace over March and April, and the average workweek dropped\nfrom an unusually high rate in February and March to a more normal\nlevel in April. The services industries recorded further large gains\nin employment in March and April, but the number of jobs in\nmanufacturing contracted in April and construction employment declined\nin both March and April. The civilian unemployment rate fell\nappreciably in April to 4.9 percent, and the labor force participation\nrate edged down from the record high reached in March.\n\nIndustrial production was unchanged in April after having\nrecorded sizable increases in March and other recent months; declines\nin mining and manufacturing were offset by a large rise in utility\noutput. The drop in manufacturing production reflected a sharp\ndecline in the output of motor vehicles and parts that was largely\nrelated to the lagged effects of strike activity in recent months.\nThe output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts\nrose moderately in April: the production of business equipment posted\nanother solid gain while the output of consumer goods and construction\nsupplies was unchanged. The rate of utilization of manufacturing\ncapacity fell in April, reflecting the decline in motor vehicle\noutput, but it remained relatively high.\n\nNominal retail sales were unchanged in March and declined in\nApril after having increased rapidly in earlier months. Weaker sales\nof motor vehicles contributed to the overall sluggishness of retail\nactivity in March and April, but spending on many other categories of\ngoods, both durable and nondurable, also was down over the two-month\nperiod after having previously grown strongly. Expenditures on\nservices advanced further through March (latest available data) even\nthough unseasonably mild weather held down outlays for heating. While\nretail sales had slowed recently, the latest surveys indicated that\nconsumer sentiment had risen further from an already markedly high\nlevel.\n\nHousing activity in March and April was in line with that in\nother recent months. Single-family housing starts were unchanged in\nApril after declining in March. Starts for the two-month period were\nonly a little below the average for 1996, and sales of new homes\nremained at a very high level in March (latest data). Multifamily\nstarts rose considerably in April and on average over March and April\nwere a little above the elevated level in the fourth quarter.\n\nBusiness fixed investment expanded briskly in the first\nquarter. Outlays for producers' durable equipment rebounded after\nfourth-quarter weakness, and spending for nonresidential structures\nposted another substantial advance. Available indicators pointed to\nfurther sizable gains in spending on both equipment and structures.\nBusiness inventory investment was up considerably in the first quarter\nafter increasing by a relatively small amount in the fourth quarter;\nhowever, inventory-sales ratios for most industry and trade groupings\nremained at very low levels.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially on balance over January and February from the\ntemporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter of last year and was\nabout the same as the rate in the third quarter. A surge in imports\nreflected a rebound in the importation of automotive products from the\nstrike-reduced level of the fourth quarter, further expansion in\npurchases of imported computers, and an upturn in imports of\nsemiconductors after four quarters of declines. By contrast, exports\nof goods and services rose only slightly in the January-February\nperiod; exports of automotive products were up sharply, but sizable\nincreases in exports of chemicals, computers, and semiconductors were\nlargely offset by declines in other non-automotive trade categories.\nRecent economic information on the foreign G-7 countries, including\nsome preliminary indicators for the second quarter, suggested that the\ngrowth of output had strengthened somewhat on average in these\ncountries. Activity in continental Europe, though still weak, was\nimproving, while the economies of Canada, Japan, and the United\nKingdom remained strong. Economic activity continued to expand\nrapidly on average in the major developing countries in the first\nquarter.\n\nRecent data indicated that price inflation remained moderate\ndespite a gradual acceleration of labor costs. Increases in consumer\nprices were held down in March and April by sizable declines in energy\nprices and a small net reduction in food prices. Consumer prices for\nitems other than food and energy advanced at a moderate rate over the\ntwo months, and over the twelve months ended in April they increased\nby the same amount as in the previous twelve months. Producer prices\nfell in both March and April, reflecting large declines in energy\nprices. Excluding food and energy, producer prices edged lower in\nApril after rising a sizable amount in March. Core producer prices\nincreased considerably less over the twelve months ended in April than\nover the previous twelve months. At earlier stages of production,\nproducer prices registered declines both in recent months and for the\ntwelve months ended in April. An upward creep in the growth of labor\ncosts was apparent in data on the hourly compensation of private\nindustry workers; although the rise in the first three months of 1997\nwas smaller than the increase in the fourth quarter, the advance over\nthe twelve months ended in March was larger than that over the\nprevious twelve months. A similar but more pronounced pattern was\nevident in data on average hourly earnings for production or\nnonsupervisory workers.\n\nAt its meeting on March 25, 1997, the Committee issued a\ndirective that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure\non reserve positions; the firming of policy was taken in light of\ncontinued rapid growth of aggregate demand in the first quarter and\nthe attendant greater risk of heightened pressures on resources and an\nupturn in inflation. Although further policy tightening might be\nneeded at some point, the Committee did not believe that developments\nduring the intermeeting period were likely to require an adjustment,\nand thus the directive did not include a presumption about adjustments\nto policy during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nsome moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations immediately after the meeting on\nMarch 25 were directed toward implementing the slightly firmer reserve\nconditions desired by the Committee and then maintaining those\nconditions over the remainder of the intermeeting period. The federal\nfunds rate averaged close to the higher intended level of 5-1/2\npercent. Open market operations were complicated during the period by\nextraordinarily large federal tax payments in April, which\nsubstantially increased the volume of open market purchases needed to\noffset the reserve drains associated with those tax payments.\n\nMarket interest rates generally posted small mixed changes\nover the intermeeting period. Most private short-term rates increased\nonly a little in response to the March policy action, which had been\nlargely anticipated by market participants. Intermediate- and long-term\nyields rose over the early part of the intermeeting period,\nresponding mostly to incoming data suggesting that growth in aggregate\ndemand and output remained strong; these increases were subsequently\nmore than reversed, however, as later information indicated that\neconomic growth was moderating and price inflation remained subdued\nand on news of an agreement to balance the federal budget. Major\nindexes of stock market prices fluctuated substantially over the\nperiod but they rose considerably on balance.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over\nthe intermeeting period. The movements of the dollar during the\nperiod roughly corresponded to the fluctuations in intermediate- and\nlong-term U.S. interest rates; the dollar advanced strongly in April\non growing expectations of a further firming of U.S. monetary policy\nbut more than retraced that gain in May as the likelihood of further\ntightening waned. The dollar's weakness in May also seemed to reflect\ngrowing attention to the prospects for official intervention to\nrestrain the dollar's rise, notably against the Japanese yen and the\nGerman mark.\n\nThe growth of M2 and M3 remained brisk over March and April.\nMuch of M2's strength during this period resulted from a temporary\nbuildup by households of balances in savings accounts and money market\nmutual funds to cover unusually large tax payments. The rapid growth\nof M3 was associated not only with the bulge in M2 but also with\nstepped-up issuance of large time deposits to fund the expansion of\nbank credit. For the year through April, both aggregates expanded at\nrates appreciably above the upper bounds of their respective ranges\nfor the year. The growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had\nmoderated over recent months as a result of reductions in federal\ngovernment borrowing.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy would expand in the second half of the year at a rate a\nlittle above that of its estimated potential and then would increase\nat a slower and more sustainable rate in 1998. Growth of consumer\nspending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further\nprojected gains in employment and income, was expected to remain\nfairly brisk over the forecast horizon. Business spending on\nequipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the\noverall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend\nto narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of\nincreases in sales and profits that was expected to be associated with\nmoderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to\ndrift lower over coming quarters, partly in conjunction with the rise\nin mortgage interest rates that already had occurred but also in\nresponse to the smaller increases expected in household income. The\nstaff continued to anticipate that fiscal policy and the external\nsector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic\nactivity. With resource utilization high and labor compensation\ngradually accelerating, core consumer price inflation was forecast to\ndrift slightly higher.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, the members agreed that the\ninformation for recent months pointed on balance to a marked slowing\nin the expansion of economic activity from a very rapid pace in late\n1996 and earlier this year. The extent of the reduced growth in the\ncurrent quarter and the prospects for subsequent quarters were subject\nto substantial uncertainty, but the members generally felt that the\neconomy retained considerable underlying strength. In the circumstances\nand assuming no changes from current financial conditions, the\nindividual members saw likely prospects for expansion over the\nforecast horizon at a pace close to, or a little above, the estimated\ngrowth of the economy's long-run potential. Many noted, however,\nthat high levels of consumer and business confidence and supportive\nfinancial conditions among other factors suggested the possibility\nthat growth could turn out to be even faster. With the utilization of\nproductive resources, notably labor, already at particularly high\nlevels in relation to the economy's potential, an outcome no stronger\nthan current forecasts could well have adverse implications for\ninflation. Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in\ncompensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be\nfew indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and\nanecdotal information available at this time; such developments\nunderlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets\nand the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.\n\nIn their review of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members referred to favorable underlying factors in the\noutlook for consumer spending, These included solid growth in\nconsumer incomes, large increases in financial wealth, and currently\nhigh levels of consumer confidence. While more moderate growth in\nconsumer spending for durable goods seemed likely after an extended\nperiod of robust expansion, these favorable factors suggested that the\nrisks of a different outcome were tilted in the direction of faster-than-projected\nexpansion. On the negative side, large consumer debts\nwere still viewed as likely to constitute an inhibiting influence on\nconsumer expenditures, and many banking institutions had tightened\nlending terms and conditions at least for their more marginal consumer\nborrowers. On balance, growth in consumer expenditures at a somewhat\nreduced pace approximating that of the expected expansion of\ndisposable incomes appeared to be a reasonable prospect, though one\nthat was subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nSpending for business fixed investment seemed to have\nretained a good deal of momentum even after the large increases in\nsuch expenditures in recent years. Clearly, businesses regarded such\ninvestments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to\ngains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising\ncompensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive\nmarkets. In the circumstances, it appeared unlikely that growth in\ncapital outlays would moderate appreciably for some time. A number of\nmembers also referred to the increasing strength in nonresidential\nconstruction, notably that of commercial structures, in several parts\nof the nation. Some referred in particular to planned or actual\nconstruction of new office buildings in various locales; such\nactivity was being stimulated by declining vacancy rates, rising\nrents, and a ready availability of financing. Likewise, a surge in\ntourism in a number of areas had resulted in a scarcity of hotel rooms\nand was spurring hotel construction in some major cities. Anecdotal\nreports of nonresidential building activity undertaken on a\nspeculative basis had increased, but a building boom reminiscent of\nthe 1980s did not appear to be under way.\n\nConcerning the outlook for housing, members referred to\nforecasts of a mild downtrend in residential construction associated\nwith the increases that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. To\ndate, however, there were few indications of any weakening. Indeed,\nhousing construction had been relatively robust in the early months of\nthe year, though the strength probably was largely accounted for by\nunusually favorable weather conditions and may have borrowed from\nbuilding activity later in the year. On balance, as evidenced by\nanecdotal reports from some areas, various factors including ongoing\ngrowth in employment and incomes, the availability of financing on\nstill generally favorable terms, and the associated affordability of\nhousing for many homeowners seemed likely to provide continued support\nfor this sector of the economy for some period of time.\n\nA surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted\nfor a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first\nquarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of\ninventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced\neconomic growth in the current quarter. In keeping with business\npractices aimed at achieving or maintaining lean inventory-sales\nratios, inventory investment was projected to continue at a relatively\nsubdued pace in coming quarters. A number of members expressed the\nview, however, that stockbuilding represented an upside risk in the\neconomic outlook, at least in the nearer term. While there were some\nindications of efforts to pare inventories in recent months, generally\noptimistic business sentiment and currently trim inventories in most\nindustries might well foster efforts to accumulate stocks at a\nrelatively rapid pace, especially if more-buoyant-than-anticipated\nsales were to stimulate a precautionary demand for inventories as had\noccurred in 1994.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, members observed\nthat increases in prices had remained subdued despite the rapid\nexpansion in economic activity in recent quarters and the associated\nincrease in pressures on already highly utilized resources. The\nappreciation of the dollar undoubtedly had helped to damp domestic\ninflation this year, and reported increases in consumer prices also\nhad been held down to a marginal extent by an ongoing series of technical\nadjustments to the CPI. These were only partial explanations,\nhowever, and the members found it very difficult to account for the\nsurprisingly benign behavior of inflation in an economy that had been\noperating at a level approximating full employment--indeed, possibly\nsomewhat above sustainable full employment in labor markets in the\nview of a number of members, especially taking into consideration the\nrecent further decline in the unemployment rate. On the basis of\nhistorical patterns, any overshooting of full employment would be\nexpected to generate rising inflation over time. Although increases\nin labor compensation had been trending higher, these pressures were\nmuted and had not shown through to prices.\n\nMembers focused on the possible role of faster-than-reported\nincreases in productivity as a key explanation for the benign behavior\nof inflation in current circumstances. Business firms had continued\nto report robust profit margins in a period when competitive pressures\ngenerally prevented them from raising their prices, or raising them\nsufficiently, to pass on the increases that they were experiencing in\nworker compensation. Standard statistical measures that pointed to\nrelatively limited increases in productivity seemed inconsistent with\nstrong profits as well as with anecdotal reports of sizable gains\nassociated with widespread business restructuring activities and large\nadditions of high-technology equipment to an increasingly efficient\ncapital stock. The ongoing development and spreading adoption of\nautomated equipment along with the increasing skills and other\ninfrastructure needed to use it effectively appeared to be creating\ngrowing efficiencies or synergies that were markedly enhancing\nproductivity and enabling firms to hold the line on prices and\nmaintain high profit margins.\n\nWhile these were welcome developments, members continued to\nexpress concern that, perhaps sooner rather than later, growing\npressures on productive resources would be reflected in some upturn in\noverall inflation. Although most measures of labor compensation had\nbeen relatively favorable recently, such measures had been displaying\na clear uptrend over a somewhat longer period, and it seemed likely\nthat, if this trend continued, labor cost developments would at some\npoint be reflected more fully in core measures of prices. Members\ncommented that the timing and extent of any upturn in price inflation\nwould depend on growth of overall demand in the economy, but they also\nbelieved that expansion of demand in line with their current\nexpectations could induce a somewhat less favorable inflation\nexperience during coming quarters. However, recent developments had\nunderscored the fact that historical experience was not a fully\nreliable guide to the prospective behavior of prices; accordingly, the\ninflation outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one of the members indicated that they could\nsupport a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, although\nsome also expressed a preference for some tightening at this meeting.\nThose who endorsed a steady policy at this time agreed that some\ntightening might well be needed later to contain potentially rising\ninflation. For now, however, economic growth seemed to be slowing to\na more sustainable pace, and the uncertainties surrounding the extent\nof the slowing and the outlook for inflation pointed to the\ndesirability of a cautious approach to any policy tightening,\nespecially given the persisting absence of a rising inflation trend in\ncurrent measures of prices. A number of members also observed that\nreal interest rates were not unusually low. Thus, the present stance\nof monetary policy probably was not very far out of alignment with\nwhat likely would prove to be a desirable degree of restraint, thereby\nlessening any risk of large and persisting imbalances that a delay in\nimplementing further restraint might incur.\n\nMembers who preferred some tightening, at least in the near\nterm if not necessarily at this meeting, noted that the Committee\nneeded to weigh the risks of having to implement a small degree of\nrestraint now versus considerably more later if inflation were allowed\nto build momentum. Monetary policy exerts its effects with a\nconsiderable lag, and a small but relatively prompt tightening action\nwould provide some further insurance against an intensification of\ninflation. Such an outcome could be seen as more likely now, given\nthe increased tightness in labor markets and the possibility that\nrelatively strong growth would put added pressures on resources. Some\nof these members commented that the risk of a retarding effect on the\neconomy from a small move at this time was quite limited in light of\nthe apparently solid momentum of the economic expansion. Indeed, the\nstrength of investment demand, the ready availability of financing,\nand possible favorable productivity gains argued that real rates of\ninterest would need to be higher than historical norms to balance\naggregate demand and supply. The risk of slightly lower economic\ngrowth needed to be compared with what they viewed as the greater risk\nof losing ground to inflation and thereby inhibiting the Committee's\nability to reach its ultimate goal of price stability, a goal that all\nthe members viewed as necessary to achieve maximum sustainable\neconomic growth over time. Given the quiescence of inflation and the\nuncertainties surrounding its outlook, however, all but one of these\nmembers could accept a wait-and-see policy stance for now.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, all the members supported a shift from the\nsymmetric directive that had been adopted in conjunction with the\npolicy tightening action at the March meeting to an asymmetric\ndirective tilted toward tightening. While such a bias did not\nnecessarily imply an intention to tighten policy during the weeks\nimmediately ahead, it was consistent with the members' view that the\nrisks were in the direction of a potential need for some tightening in\nmonetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, and that\nthey might be required to make such a decision in the not-too-distant\nfuture.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMarket interest rates generally have posted small\nmixed changes since the Committee meeting on March 25,\n1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies declined on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 was brisk over March and April,\nboosted by a buildup in household balances to cover\nunusually large tax payments. For the year through\nApril, both aggregates expanded at rates appreciably\nabove the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the\nyear. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has\nmoderated over recent months, reflecting reductions in\nfederal government borrowing.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in\nFebruary established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured\nfrom the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of\n1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nsome moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow, Parry,\nMses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the\nstrength of investment demand, due possibly to an increase in the\ntrend growth rate of productivity, required somewhat higher real\ninterest rates to prevent inflationary pressures from developing. He\nwas concerned that, with the economy already operating at a high\nlevel and labor markets apparently very tight, any increase in such\npressures might be costly to reverse and might reduce the credibility\nof the Committee's longer-run strategy of promoting maximum\nsustainable growth by fostering price level stability. He also\nbelieved that the risk to the economy of a moderate further tightening\nwas small given the apparent momentum of aggregate economic activity.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 1-2, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m."
