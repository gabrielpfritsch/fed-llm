There were no open market transactions in\nforeign currencies for System account during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial\nmarkets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period January\n31, 1996, through March 25, 1996. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nMuch of the information reviewed at this meeting had been\ninfluenced to an uncertain degree by unusually severe winter weather,\nindustrial strikes, and U.S. government shutdowns. On balance,\nhowever, growth of economic activity appeared to have picked up after\nhaving slowed appreciably in late 1995. Growth in consumer spending\nseemed to have resumed at a moderate rate in the wake of January's\nstorms; business spending on durable equipment was recording further\nhealthy gains; and housing demand was showing some signs of\nstrengthening. With businesses making considerable progress in\ngetting their inventories under control, industrial production and\nemployment had rebounded briskly. The recent data on prices gave\nlittle indication of any change in underlying inflation trends.\n\nA surge in nonfarm payroll employment in February\nconsiderably more than offset a large weather-related drop in January.\nVery large job gains were recorded in February in the construction,\nretail trade, and services industries; however, some of these\nincreases reflected the reversal of the depressing effects of\nJanuary's severe winter storms and the efforts of some firms to make\nup for associated production losses. A small rise in manufacturing\nemployment in February only partially offset a further loss of factory\njobs in January. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent\nin February.\n\nIndustrial production rose sharply in February, more than\noffsetting a sizable decline in January. Part of the net increase in\noutput over the January-February period reflected an upturn in\naircraft production after the settlement of a strike at a major\naircraft manufacturer. In addition, output of office and computing\nmachines continued to rise at a rapid pace, and the production of\nother types of business equipment picked up. Output of consumer goods\nchanged little on balance over the two-month period. Manufacturing\nproduction expanded about in line with capacity over the first two\nmonths of the year, leaving the overall rate of utilization of\nmanufacturing capacity little changed.\n\nNominal retail sales increased briskly in February after\nhaving registered little change in January. The February spurt was\npaced by strong motor vehicle purchases, but spending at general\nmerchandise stores and apparel outlets also was up considerably after\na weak performance in previous months. Sales at durable goods stores\nwere less robust, rising only slightly in February. Recent indicators\nof housing demand and activity were generally favorable. Starts of\nboth single-family and multifamily units moved higher on balance over\nJanuary and February, and sales of new homes increased appreciably in\nJanuary (latest data available). By contrast, sales of existing homes\ndeclined in January for a fourth consecutive month.\n\nBusiness demand for durable equipment apparently remained\nfairly robust in early 1996. Incoming orders for computing equipment\nwere particularly strong in January, and shipments of such equipment\nposted further healthy gains. With airline profits high and new\nmodels of airplanes being introduced, orders for aircraft had climbed\nrapidly over recent months. Orders for other types of equipment also\nhad picked up on balance over the last several months, although\nshipments of such equipment dropped in January after a sizable rise in\nthe fourth quarter. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to\nbe growing more slowly: non-office commercial construction continued\nits upward trend but office, institutional, and industrial building\nactivity had slowed noticeably in recent months, and contracts for\nthose categories also had softened.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in\nDecember (latest data available) was little changed from its November\nlevel. On a quarterly-average basis, however, the deficit in the\nfourth quarter was substantially smaller than it had been in the third\nquarter. The value of exports of goods and services rose appreciably\nin the fourth quarter, with the largest increases occurring in\nmachinery exports and foreign tourist services. The value of imports\ndeclined slightly, largely as a result of decreases in imports of\nautomotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The data available on\neconomic conditions in the major foreign industrial countries in early\n1996 suggested that a moderate recovery was under way in Japan, and\nthere were some signs of a pickup in activity in much of Western\nEurope, although the German economy remained weak.\n\nInflation trends had remained stable in recent months. At\nthe consumer level, food prices continued to edge up in February and\nenergy prices again were under appreciable upward pressure. Excluding\nthe often-volatile food and energy items, consumer prices advanced in\nFebruary at a slightly slower rate than in January; and for the twelve\nmonths ended in February, consumer prices rose a little less than in\nthe comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of\nfinished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance\nover January and February; the rise in this measure of prices over the\ntwelve months ended in February was somewhat larger than in the\ncomparable year-earlier interval. Average hourly earnings of\nproduction and nonsupervisory workers edged down in February after a\nconsiderable increase in January. However, for the twelve-month\nperiod ended in February, average hourly earnings rose more than in\nthe year-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on January 30-31, 1996, the Committee adopted\na directive that called for a slight reduction in the degree of\npressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible reduction\nof 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive approved\nby the Committee did not include a presumption about the likely\ndirection of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period,\nshould unanticipated developments warrant a policy change.\nAccordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable\nduring the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOn January 31, the Board of Governors approved a reduction of\n1/4 percentage point in the discount rate, to a level of 5 percent.\nThe decrease was made effective immediately and was passed through to\ninterest rates in reserve markets. Open market operations during the\nintermeeting period were directed toward maintaining this new policy\nstance, and the federal funds rate averaged around 5-1/4 percent, the\nlevel expected to be associated with that stance.\n\nBecause the easing move had been largely anticipated in\nfinancial markets, the initial response was a small decline in short-\nterm rates and little change in long-term rates. Over the remainder\nof the period, however, most interest rates moved higher in response\nto incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting improved\nprospects for economic growth and, accordingly, a reduced likelihood\nof further easings in monetary policy. In addition, the absence of\nmuch progress in federal budget negotiations was viewed by the markets\nas indicating that the chances a major multiyear deficit-reduction\nplan would be adopted this year were becoming more remote. Despite\nthe increase in bond yields, major indexes of equity prices recorded\nsizable gains.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over\nthe intermeeting period. The dollar fell appreciably during the\ninitial portion of the period -- before evidence of a more robust U.S.\neconomy emerged -- while data on German money supply and the Japanese\neconomy were suggesting upward revisions to expected interest rates\nabroad. In late February, emerging signs that the U.S. economy was\ngenerally stronger than expected and that economic conditions abroad\nwere comparatively weaker than they had seemed earlier fostered a\nrebound in the value of the dollar.\n\nGrowth of the broader monetary aggregates strengthened\nconsiderably in February and early March following the decline in\nshort-term interest rates in late 1995 and early 1996. The\nacceleration of M2 reflected a surge in demand deposits as well as\nlarger inflows to retail money market mutual funds, whose yields tend\nto adjust with a lag to changes in short-term market interest rates.\nLarger inflows to institution-only money market funds contributed to\nM3's stronger performance. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt\nslowed somewhat in December and January, reflecting reduced federal\ngovernment borrowing, but remained moderate on balance.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe pace of economic expansion would pick up over coming months after\na sluggish fourth quarter. Other than a better performance over the\nfirst half of 1996 associated with somewhat faster increase in final\nsales, this forecast differed little from that prepared for the\nprevious meeting and indicated that the economy was expected to expand\ngenerally along its estimated potential. Consumer spending was\nprojected to grow slightly more than disposable income; the favorable\neffect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample\navailability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer\nconcerns about job security and the effects of already high household\ndebt burdens. Homebuilding activity was projected to decline a little\nin response to the recent backup in residential mortgage rates but to\nremain at a relatively high level. A less rapid pace of business\ninvestment in equipment and structures was expected in light of the\ndecline over the past year in the rate of utilization of production\ncapacity and the moderate growth projected for sales and profits. The\nexternal sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on\neconomic activity over the projection period. The persisting impasse\nin the federal budget negotiations suggested little further fiscal\ncontraction in coming quarters. Given the outlook for economic\nactivity, rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected\nto change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on the resiliency of the\neconomy, which appeared to have strengthened appreciably after a\nperiod of subpar growth. The latter had been induced to a large\nextent by inventory adjustments whose effects were exacerbated\ntemporarily by government shutdowns, unusually severe winter weather,\nand industrial strikes. The adjustment in inventory investment seemed\nto be nearing its completion, and some members observed that the\nsettlement of the recent strike in the motor vehicle industry might\nwell impart added impetus to the expansion over the nearer term.\nConsiderable volatility could be expected in the short-run performance\nof the economy, but the members continued to view trend growth at a\npace near the economy's potential as the most probable outcome. Many\nalso commented that the risks to such a forecast appeared to have\nshifted from being predominantly on the downside earlier in the year\nto better balanced currently. Still, substantial uncertainties\nattended the economic outlook, and a number of members observed that\nan economic performance that differed considerably in either direction\nfrom their current forecasts might well materialize over the\nprojection period. Regarding the outlook for inflation, members'\nassessments tended to center on expectations of little change in\naverage consumer price inflation over the projection horizon.\n\nThe economy had displayed considerable resilience in the face\nof adjustments to production associated with efforts by many business\nfirms to reduce inventories and a number of additional, albeit\ntemporary, developments that had tended to retard the expansion in the\nlatter part of 1995 and at the start of this year. Apparently,\nrelatively low long-term interest rates and the related substantial\nappreciation in the value of stock and bond market holdings had been\nimportant factors helping to sustain spending in this period. In the\ncontext of continued underlying momentum in final demand and some\ndecline in excess stocks of unsold motor vehicles stemming from the\nrecently ended strike at a major domestic producer, inventories now\nseemed to be in better balance with sales and the economy to be better\npositioned to accommodate sustained expansion. Some members observed,\nhowever, that the recent increase in intermediate- and long-term\ninterest rates would tend to blunt demand in interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy. Moreover, stock market prices had risen to\ncomparatively high levels in relation to earnings and interest rates\nand might be vulnerable to further weakness in the debt markets or to\nany tendency for business profit margins to erode.\n\nIn the course of their comments about developments in key\nsectors of the economy, members referred to recent indications,\nincluding anecdotal reports, of appreciable strengthening in retail\nsales that tended to support forecasts of sustained growth in consumer\nspending in coming quarters. In addition, surveys of consumer\nsentiment, which had been more favorable recently, and sharply\nincreased household net worth were seen as positive factors in the\noutlook for consumer expenditures. On the negative side, some members\nobserved that the rise in consumer indebtedness and the recent\nincrease in interest rates would tend to damp consumer spending.\nGiven these financial crosscurrents, it was suggested that growth in\nconsumer spending might approximate that of disposable income over the\nforecast horizon.\n\nThe prospects for business capital spending remained a sup-\nportive element in the outlook for further economic expansion, but\ngrowth in such spending was expected to slow considerably from its\nrapid pace over the past few years. The ready availability and fairly\nlow cost of business finance in equity and debt markets and the\ncontinuing commitment of business firms to modernizing their\nfacilities to hold down costs in highly competitive markets would tend\nto support growth in business fixed investment. Profits and cash\nflows were expected to remain reasonably strong, though there were\ntentative signs of some softening in profit margins. On the other\nhand, the longevity of the current expansion had resulted in the\naddition of a good deal of production capacity in recent years. This\ndevelopment in conjunction with some decline in capacity utilization\nover the past several quarters pointed to less need for expansion in\nplant and equipment. The rise in outlays for computers and related\nproducts was likely to remain fairly robust in light of the continuing\nadvances in technology and the marked downtrend in computer prices,\nbut the growth of computer expenditures was projected to be well below\nthe extraordinary pace of the past few years. The slowdown would\nreflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall\nbusiness investment spending and a greater saturation of potential\ncomputer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement\ndemand rather than the further expansion of capacity.\n\nHousing activity generally was expected to be well maintained\nin coming quarters, though likely to moderate to some extent from\ncurrent levels in lagged response to the rise that had occurred in\nmortgage interest rates. The response of housing expenditures to rate\nincreases was uncertain, and a few members commented that the\nprospective slowing in housing construction could be fairly\npronounced. For the nearer term, however, recent data were indicative\nof considerable underlying strength in housing markets, especially in\nlight of the adverse effects of notably unfavorable weather conditions\nin many parts of the country this winter. Those data tended to be\nsupported by anecdotal reports of significant improvement in housing\nmarkets in several regions over the course of recent months.\nContributing to that performance, however, might be a temporary\nacceleration of purchases by home buyers who anticipated further\nincreases in mortgage interest rates. The latter were viewed,\nnonetheless, as still low in comparison with their average level over\nthe past several years.\n\nThe outlook for fiscal policy remained uncertain, especially\nfor future years. It was suggested that the stalemate between the\nCongress and the Administration on major spending and tax issues might\nnot be resolved in coming months or indeed during the current session\nof Congress. However, already legislated appropriations and current\ncontinuing resolutions still pointed to considerable restraint in\nfederal spending this year. With regard to the external sector of the\neconomy, projections of appreciable growth in exports tended to be\nsupported by anecdotal comments of strong export demand for goods\nproduced in various parts of the country, including some improvement\nin exports to Mexico. At the same time, imports might well expand\nsomewhat more rapidly than exports if the domestic economy\nstrengthened as projected this year from its reduced rate of growth in\n1995.\n\nThe members did not differ greatly in their assessments of\nthe most probable course of inflation. Their expectations ranged from\nessentially unchanged to slightly higher inflation in comparison with\n1995. At the same time, members expressed somewhat differing views\nabout possible deviations of inflation from their expectations. Those\nwho emphasized the risks of higher-than-projected inflation tended to\ncite the potential for increasing wage and price pressures in an\neconomy that already was operating at or close to its estimated\ncapacity. Increases in labor costs had been unusually subdued in\nlight of the relatively low unemployment nationwide and widespread\nanecdotal reports of labor shortages. In this view the rise in labor\ncosts could well accelerate at some point, though not necessarily in\nthe near term, with some feedthrough to prices. Other developments\nthat generated some concern about the outlook for inflation included\nthe rise in the costs of medical benefits in the fourth quarter, price\npressures in the energy and food sectors of the economy, and the\npossibility that the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term\ninterest rates might to some extent reflect worsening inflationary\nexpectations. Other members saw only a limited risk of higher\ninflation, and a few indicated that they did not rule out some\nreduction in consumer price inflation from that experienced in 1995.\nIn this view there was sufficient capacity in the economy to allow\nroom for moderate growth of economic activity in line with their\nforecasts without fostering added inflation. Moreover, there was only\nscattered evidence of accelerating increases in worker compensation\nassociated with labor shortages and little indication that possibly\ndiminishing worries about job security would induce rising labor\nmilitancy. Some members also stressed the persistence of strong\ncompetition in numerous markets that tended to preclude or restrain\nraising prices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. This policy\npreference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at\na pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a\nperception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were\nmore balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these\ncircumstances inflation would remain constrained. The economy seemed\nto have adequate forward momentum and did not appear to require any\nfurther stimulus, whose implementation might contribute to\ninflationary pressures in the economy. Several members observed that\nrobust growth in broad money for some months suggested that monetary\npolicy had been supportive of sustained economic expansion. At the\nsame time, information on the economy and prices did not seem to\nindicate developing inflation pressures that needed to be contained by\ntightening policy at this juncture. Indeed, some members commented\nthat, judged from one perspective, financial conditions had tightened\nsomewhat as a consequence of the recent rise in intermediate- and\nlong-term interest rates, though it was difficult to disentangle the\nreal and the inflation components of the rate increases. Nonetheless,\na number of members noted that inflation was not expected to moderate\nfurther over the projection horizon and that it could move higher and\nthe Committee would need to be particularly vigilant in guarding\nagainst such an outcome. Against this background, the members favored\nan unbiased instruction in the directive that did not prejudice\npossible intermeeting adjustments to policy in either direction.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated a preference for a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nChanges in short-term market interest rates have\nbeen mixed while long-term rates have risen appreciably\nsince the Committee meeting on January 30-31. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has\ndeclined slightly over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 has strengthened considerably\nin recent months, while expansion in total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has remained moderate on balance.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stabil-\nity and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in January established ranges for growth of M2\nand M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995\nto the fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMcTeer, Ms. Phillips, Mr. Stern, and Ms. Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, May 21, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary"
