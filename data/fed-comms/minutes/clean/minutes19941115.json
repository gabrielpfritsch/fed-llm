By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these\ntransactions.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod September 27, 1994, through November 14, 1994. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\ngrowth of the economy remained substantial. Consumer spending was\nrobust, business fixed investment continued on a strong upward trend,\nand housing activity had been well sustained despite the increase in\nmortgage interest rates over the past year. Business inventory\ninvestment had been brisk since the spring, apparently in response to\nthe strong growth in final sales. Further sizable gains had been\nrecorded in industrial production and employment. Increases in labor\ncompensation were still moderate, although there were some tentative\nsigns of wage acceleration associated with the further tightening of\nlabor markets. Prices of many materials continued to move up rapidly,\nbut broad indexes did not indicate a pickup in consumer inflation.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in\nOctober, with job gains widespread by industry. In the service-producing sector, retail trade posted a particularly large advance\nwhile health and business services continued to record moderate\nincreases. Manufacturing employment was up in October after having\nbeen unchanged in September; the rise was related partly to continued\njob growth in automobile-and construction-related industries, but\npayrolls also expanded in a number of other industries, including\ntextiles, paper, rubber, and plastics. Construction hiring slowed\nafter a large rise in September. Employment, as measured by the\nhousehold survey, increased by more than the labor force in October,\nand the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent.\n\nIndustrial production increased substantially in October\nafter having posted appreciable advances on balance in previous\nmonths. Manufacturing output accounted for all of the October rise as\nproduction declined again in the mining and utilities components. In\nmanufacturing, the pace of motor vehicle assemblies was unchanged, but\nproduction in automotive-related industries was stepped up noticeably\nand output of business equipment continued to expand vigorously.\nTotal utilization of industrial capacity climbed further in October\nfrom already elevated rates.\n\nConsumer confidence remained at a high level, and retail\nsales continued to rise rapidly in October. Automotive dealers\nreported a large increase in sales, but strength also was evident\nelsewhere: Furniture and appliance stores posted another appreciable\ngain; apparel outlets registered a brisk rise; and spending at food\nand general merchandise stores grew moderately. Housing starts rose\nappreciably in September, reaching their highest level of the year.\nSales of new and existing homes were stronger in September, despite\nthe higher interest rates on both fixed-and adjustable-rate\nmortgages that had prevailed since earlier in the year.\n\nBusiness capital spending remained on a solid uptrend.\nShipments of nondefense capital goods were brisk during the third\nquarter, and with orders continuing to exceed shipments, already large\nbacklogs increased further for most types of business equipment.\nSpending for transportation equipment grew at a healthy rate in the\nthird quarter; purchases of heavy trucks persisted at a very high\nlevel, and spending for motor vehicles picked up after a second-quarter lull. Nonresidential construction activity advanced at a\nreduced pace in the third quarter; however, permits for new\nconstruction continued to trend higher.\n\nBusiness inventory investment apparently continued at a brisk\npace in the third quarter, with much of the accumulation occurring in\ntypes of goods where sales were strong. Manufacturing stocks fell in\nSeptember, but for the third quarter as a whole they increased at the\nsame moderate rate as in the second quarter; the inventory-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing in September remained near the\nhistorical low reached the previous month. At the wholesale level,\ninventory accumulation slowed slightly in the third quarter, and the\ninventory-to-sales ratio was in the lower end of its range over recent\nyears. Retail inventories surged in August (latest data available)\nafter having declined slightly in July. Nonetheless, the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range\nin recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was\nsubstantially larger than its second-quarter average. The value of\nexports of goods and services rebounded in August, with increases\nspread widely among automotive products, aircraft, agricultural\nproducts, machinery, and consumer goods. The value of imports also\nincreased in August, but by a lesser amount than that of exports; much\nof the rise reflected greater imports of automotive vehicles from\nCanada. Economic activity continued to expand in the major foreign\nindustrial countries in the third quarter, but growth apparently was\nat a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year.\n\nConsumer price inflation remained moderate in September. For\nitems other than the food and energy components, the increase in\nconsumer prices over the twelve months ending in September was\nslightly smaller than the rise over the previous twelve months. At\nthe producer level, prices of finished goods declined, largely\nreflecting a sharp fall in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding\nfood and energy items, producer prices edged up in September and had\nrisen slowly over the twelve months ending in September. At\nintermediate stages of processing, prices of many materials, notably\nindustrial materials, had continued to move up rapidly. Total\ncompensation of private industry workers rose significantly less over\nthe four quarters ending in September than over the previous four\nquarters, primarily reflecting a sharply smaller increase in benefit\ncosts. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory\nworkers recorded a large gain in September after having expanded\nmoderately over previous months.\n\nAt its meeting on September 27, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but included a bias toward possible firming\nduring the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater\nreserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the\nyear.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. As the need for seasonal credit waned over the period,\nadjustment plus seasonal borrowing declined substantially, with actual\nborrowing remaining close to anticipated levels. Apart from some\ntightness in reserves markets around the end of the third quarter, the\nfederal funds rate averaged close to 4-3/4 percent.\n\nMost market interest rates rose appreciably over the period\nsince the September 27 meeting in response to incoming economic data\nthat generally indicated sustained momentum in final sales and\ninventory investment and high levels of aggregate output relative to\nthe economy's potential. The strong economic data and persisting\nupward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production appeared to\nheighten concerns among market participants about inflationary\npressures and prospects for even more monetary tightening than had\npreviously been anticipated. Most major indexes of equity prices were\nlittle changed on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies changed little on net over the intermeeting period.\nThe dollar trended lower over much of the period, apparently\nreflecting market perceptions that inflation risks in the United\nStates were on the rise. In early November, after reaching a new\npost-World War II low against the yen and a two-year low against the\nmark, the dollar began to recover. The rebound in the value of the\ndollar apparently was in part a response to U.S. intervention in\nsupport of the dollar and heightened expectations of further monetary\ntightening in the United States.\n\nM2 continued to edge lower in October; the weakness was\nconcentrated in its more-liquid deposit components, for which\nopportunity costs had risen very substantially this year. M3 expanded\nat a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits issued to finance rapid loan growth and to\ncounter runoffs of nondeposit sources of funds. For the year through\nOctober, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for\n1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate\nrate in recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth in economic activity would slow markedly over the next several\nquarters and for a period would average less than the rate of increase\nin the economy's potential output. In the staff's judgment, the\neconomy currently was operating at or beyond its long-run capacity,\nand the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate\nany continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that\ncould foster sustained higher inflation. The expansion of consumer\nspending was projected to slow considerably in response to diminishing\npent-up demands, higher borrowing costs, and reduced income growth.\nBusiness fixed investment also was anticipated to decelerate\nappreciably in the context of smaller increases in sales and less\nfavorable financial conditions. Homebuilding was expected to be\ndamped by higher financing costs, although housing activity likely\nwould remain well above the depressed levels of recent years when\ncash-flow affordability had been less favorable. The lower value of\nthe dollar and the favorable prospects for faster economic recovery\nabroad were projected to bolster the demand for U.S. exports. With\nthe economy having reached or exceeded its long-run potential in the\nstaff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up\nfor a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources\neased.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on widespread statistical and\nanecdotal indications of considerably greater strength in the business\nexpansion than they had anticipated earlier, with numerous industries\nnow operating at or beyond historic, long-run capacity levels. They\nsaw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating\ntoward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view\nsome slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy\ntightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on\ninterest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases\nin prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not\nappear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that\ninflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand,\nrising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were\nfelt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other\nproducer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full\nemployment levels.\n\nThe evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a\npace appreciably above that of the economy's long-run potential and of\ndeveloping pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal\nreports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and\ngrowing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor.\nOngoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to\nhold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of\nthe country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic\ngrowth, including California where economic activity now seemed to\nhave turned up after an extended period of weakness. Sentiment among\nretailers and other business contacts was widely reported to be quite\nfavorable. In addition, some members commented that despite higher\ninterest rates financial conditions generally remained conducive to\nfurther business expansion. The lending constraints that had tended\nto retard the expansion earlier seemed to have given way to\nincreasingly accommodative loan policies by depository institutions\nand ready access to market sources of financing for many business\nfirms.\n\nIn their assessment of the contribution of key sectors of the\neconomy to the expansion, members commented on the current strength of\nconsumer spending and also noted that business contacts were\nexpressing considerable optimism about the prospects for retail sales\nover the holiday season. Consumer sentiment, as evidenced by survey\nresults and retailer comments, appeared to be at a high level. Some\nmoderation in the growth of consumer spending could be expected to\nemerge next year for a variety of reasons, including reduced pent-up\ndemands and some anticipated slowing in the growth of employment and\nconsumer incomes. Members also noted that rising interest rates were\nlikely to damp consumer spending, notably for durable goods, though\nthere was little evidence of such a development thus far. A projected\nsoftening in housing markets would contribute to slower growth in\ndemand for housing-related consumer durables.\n\nExpanding sales and favorable profit margins were fostering\nstrong growth in business fixed investment, and much of the momentum\nin this sector probably would carry over into 1995. Some business\ncontacts reported that they were developing plans for major capital\noutlays over coming months. As the year progressed, however, the\nincreases that had occurred in interest rates, and the possibility of\nless receptive financial conditions more generally, should begin to\nexert some inhibiting effects on business fixed investment, especially\nif profit margins also were to fall in the context of rising labor and\nother costs.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for housing, members reported that\nconditions were somewhat uneven across the country but that for the\nnation as a whole rising mortgage rates had had surprisingly little\neffect thus far on this typically interest-sensitive sector of the\neconomy. One reason, it was suggested, was the apparent willingness\nof some homebuyers to accept higher mortgage rates at this point\nbecause they expected rates to rise further later. Even so, the\nmembers continued to anticipate some slowdown in housing construction\nover coming quarters. Overall construction activity was likely to be\nsupported to some extent, however, by further gradual gains in\nnonresidential construction, notably commercial and industrial\nstructures, and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily\nhousing.\n\nAfter a surge in the second quarter, inventory investment\nremained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be\ncontinuing at a robust pace in the current quarter. For a variety of\nreasons, inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for\nsome period of time, given the favorable sales experience of numerous\nbusiness firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative\nto sales. Moreover, with capacity pressures in many industries\nleading to some lengthening in delivery times, businesses would tend\nto build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to\nproduction schedules. Tending to confirm such an assessment were\nanecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were\nlargely intended and not the result of disappointing sales. An\ninventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and\nthird quarters would not be sustainable, but inventory investment was\nlikely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if\naggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations.\n\nThe members generally anticipated that the external sector of\nthe economy would provide some impetus to the expansion. The recent\ndepreciation of the dollar and strength in foreign economic activity\ncould be expected to boost real exports at a time when growth in real\nimports was likely to moderate. The resulting improvement in the\nnation's net trade position would, however, tend to exacerbate any\ntendency for domestic demand to outrun the economy's output potential.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the outlook for prices,\nthe members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth\nin demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace, placing added\npressures on labor and other producer resources. They noted\nindications of greater inflation pressures, especially in the rising\nprices of many materials used in the production process and the\nincreasing number of reports of labor shortages. To date, prices of\nfinished goods and services did not reflect those pressures and\noverall wage inflation did not appear to be trending higher. Even so,\nat least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over\nthe quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong\ncompetition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most\nmarkets. This view seemed to be reinforced by increasing reports of\nsuccessful efforts by some business firms to establish and sustain\nhigher prices and by numerous indications of business plans to raise\nprices around year-end or the early part of next year. Other factors\nthat appeared to have adverse implications for the inflation outlook\nincluded faster increases in import prices, and in the view of at\nleast some members the prospect of diminishing gains in productivity.\nMoreover, as evidenced by the comments of some business contacts and\nthe behavior of financial markets, inflationary expectations might be\nin the process of worsening, though such a development could not be\nseen in broad survey results. To what extent such expectations would\nbecome more pervasive and foster greater inflation momentum was very\ndifficult to gauge at this point. One member suggested that some\nfurther rise in inflation might reflect a typical development in a\nmaturing cyclical expansion but that such a rise would not necessarily\naugur a permanent uptick in inflation or even that progress toward\nprice stability would not continue to be made over time, provided\nappropriate monetary policies were pursued.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members agreed that the current stance of\nmonetary policy presented unacceptable risks of embedding higher\ninflation in the economy. The expansion retained appreciably more\nforward momentum and greater inflationary potential than the members\nhad anticipated, given the policy restraint implemented earlier this\nyear. The reasons for that outcome remained unclear. Among the\nsuggested explanations were that the earlier restraint appeared to\nhave had a less-than-expected effect on current economic conditions\nand, in particular, on the more interest-sensitive sectors of the\neconomy. Some members also suggested that the underlying expansion\nwas stronger than they had anticipated, and a couple referred to the\npossibility that the lingering effects from the accommodative policy\nstance maintained through last year were larger than had been\nexpected. Moreover, additional monetary restraint seemed to be needed\nto counteract the stimulative effects on domestic economic activity of\na number of atypical financial developments in a period of rising\ninterest rates; these included the easing of non-price credit terms by\ndepository institutions, the ample availability of funds in debt and\nequity markets, and the depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange\nmarkets. The members recognized that monetary policy actions exerted\nmuch of their effects after relatively long lags and that a\nsubstantial portion of the restraint stemming from the earlier policy\nactions undoubtedly had not yet been felt in the economy. They\nagreed, nonetheless, that monetary policy was still insufficiently\nrestrictive in light of emerging inflationary signals in the economy.\nViews differed to some extent, however, regarding the degree of\nadditional restraint that might be needed to foster the Committee's\nobjectives for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.\n\nA majority of the members believed that an unusually sizable\nfirming of monetary policy was desirable at this time, and they\nendorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions in line with a 3/4\npercentage point increase in the discount rate that a number of\nFederal Reserve Banks had proposed for approval by the Board of\nGovernors. In this view, the data becoming available in recent months\nhad suggested considerable resilience and underlying strength in\neconomic activity and rising risks of greater inflation pressures. A\nsomewhat aggressive tightening action would improve the prospects for\ncurbing intensifying inflationary pressures before they gathered\nfurther momentum and would help position the economy on a sustainable\ngrowth path consistent with the economy's long-run potential. The\nmembers acknowledged the difficulty of judging the precise degree of\nmonetary restraint that would be needed to attain the Committee's\nobjectives and in particular the risk that further efforts to control\ninflation at this juncture might foster greater-than-intended\nweakening of the expansion. The Committee could not prejudge how\nmuch, if any, additional monetary restraint might be needed in the\nfuture. That would depend on further developments, but for most\nmembers a sizable move at this point represented the most appropriate\nbalance among the competing risks. During this discussion, it was\nnoted that recent developments were having an unsettling effect on\nfinancial markets, and a tightening move of this magnitude might\ncontribute to market stability by reducing expectations of higher\ninflation and a further near-term policy action. Some members also\ncommented that the action would tend to reinforce the recent\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets.\n\nOther members indicated that they preferred a less forceful\npolicy move at this point, one that would be consistent with the 1/2\npercentage point increase in the discount rate that had been proposed\nby several Federal Reserve Banks. In their view, substantial further\nrestraint could be expected from the combined effects of the policy\ntightening actions implemented earlier this year and the inevitable\nwaning of the stimulative effects of policy actions taken in previous\nyears. While the need for further monetary restraint could not be\nruled out, a more limited policy move at this point could reasonably\nbe expected in this view to accomplish the greater part or all of the\nCommittee's anti-inflationary objectives over time and would minimize\nthe risk of setting policy on an overly restrictive course with\nundesired consequences for the business expansion later. Moreover, a\ncautious approach could lessen the risk that the Committee's policy\nintentions would be misinterpreted, with some resulting damage to\nconsumer and business confidence and dislocation in financial markets.\nDespite their reservations, these members indicated that they could\naccept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of\nthe quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on\nthe economy over time.\n\nWith regard to possible changes in policy during the period\nuntil the next meeting, a majority of the members favored associating\nthe more substantial policy adjustment with a symmetric intermeeting\ninstruction. This preference was based on expectations that a further\npolicy action was not likely to be called for over the near term,\nalthough a symmetric directive would not prevent an intermeeting\nadjustment if near-term developments differed substantially from\nexpectations. One member expressed the view that the unusually large\nmove made it especially important to follow a steady policy course for\nsome period of time and to undertake any further firming only if new\ninformation of a surprisingly strong nature were to be received.\nAnother member indicated a preference for an asymmetric directive\ntoward restraint because such a directive would be more consistent\nwith the likely need in his view for further monetary restraint to\ncontain inflationary forces in the economy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all\nthe members indicated they could support a directive that called for a\nsignificant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase of 3/4 percentage point in the\ndiscount rate, and that did not include a presumption about the likely\ndirection of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve\nrestraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.\nAccording to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at\nthis meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably\nfurther in October, and the civilian unemployment rate\nedged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production\nregistered a large increase in October after posting\nsizable gains on average over other recent months, and\ncapacity utilization moved up further from already high\nlevels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly.\nHousing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders\nfor nondefense capital goods point to a continued\nstrong expansion in spending on business equipment;\npermits for nonresidential construction have been\ntrending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to\nhave continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter.\nFor July and August combined, the nominal deficit on\nU.S. trade in goods and services widened from its\nsecond-quarter average. Prices of many materials have\ncontinued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of\nprices for consumer goods and services have increased\nmoderately on average over recent months.\n\nMost market interest rates have risen appreciably\nsince the September meeting. The trade-weighted value\nof the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was\nessentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod, though it was weaker through much of the\nperiod.\n\nM2 contracted further in October while M3 expanded\nat a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in\nlarge-denomination time deposits. For the year through\nOctober, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the\nCommittee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the\nlower half of its range for the year. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate\nrate in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of\n1994. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases could\npersist during the year and that money growth within\nthese ranges would be consistent with its broad policy\nobjectives. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed\non tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of\n1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for\nM3. The Committee provisionally set the associated\nmonitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial\ndebt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase significantly\nthe existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase in the discount\nrate. In the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater\nreserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint\nwould be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,\nKelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry and Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nSecretary's note: The meeting was recessed briefly at this\npoint and the members of the Board of Governors convened to consider\npending Reserve Bank proposals for increases in the discount rate.\nAfter the conclusion of that meeting, the Presidents of the Federal\nReserve Banks were informed that the Board of Governors had approved an\nincrease of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate, effective\nimmediately, and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee then\nresumed.\n\nSystem Foreign Currency Arrangements\n\nThe Committee considered the renewal of the System's currency\n(\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks. These arrangements\nnormally have one-year maturities and, except for those with the Bank\nof Canada and the Bank of Mexico, were due to mature on various dates\nin December 1994.\n\nIn the course of their review, the members discussed sterilized intervention by the Federal Reserve in the foreign exchange\nmarkets. They generally agreed that in certain circumstances such\nintervention serves a useful purpose, such as helping to counter\ndisorderly market conditions, but it normally would not be expected to\nhave lasting effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar in\nthe absence of other policy adjustments. In the overwhelming number\nof instances for more than a decade, the Federal Reserve has participated jointly with the U.S. Treasury in foreign exchange operations.\nIn the view of most members it seemed advisable to continue that\nprocedure, especially given the System's responsibilities for the\noverall financial health of the economy and ongoing cooperation with\nthe Treasury regarding the nation's broad financial objectives.\nNonetheless, the apparently limited and temporary effectiveness of\nsterilized intervention counseled caution in reliance on such\ntransactions. Against this background, nearly all the members\nbelieved that the System's reciprocal currency arrangements, which\nwere a potential source of foreign currencies that might be used for\nintervention purposes as well as an ongoing symbol of cooperation with\nother participating central banks, should be renewed for another year.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee\nauthorized the renewal for further periods of one year of the System's\nreciprocal currency arrangements with twelve foreign central banks and\nthe Bank for International Settlements.

Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal\nReserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention\ncompromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.\nBecause sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the\nabsence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve\nparticipation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two\nundesirable outcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is\njeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively,\nthe credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not\nfollow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions\nconsequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is\nassociated in the mind of the public with the failed operations. In\nthese circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap\nlines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate\nmarket intervention.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, December 20, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
