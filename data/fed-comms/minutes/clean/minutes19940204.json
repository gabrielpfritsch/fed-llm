System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be\ndirected at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that\nmarket exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior\nconsistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.\n\n2.

All operations\nundertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to\nthe Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on\nany day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the\nCommittee.\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the\nSystem's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150\nmillion, or $300 million when the operation is associated with\nrepayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of\ntrading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change\nin the System's net position in that currency might be less than the\nlimits specified in l.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the\nSubcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the\nfull Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion\nsince the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\narrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the\nChairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any\noperations that are not of a routine character.\n\nAgreement to \"Warehouse\" Foreign Currencies\n\nAt its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee had\nreaffirmed the $5 billion limit on the amount of eligible foreign\ncurrencies that the System was prepared to \"warehouse\" for the\nTreasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of\nthe warehousing facility is to supplement, at the discretion of the\nFederal Reserve, the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF\nfor financing their purchases of foreign currencies and related\ninternational operations. There had been no use of this facility\nsince a ESF repayment of $2 billion on April 2, 1992. The Committee\ndecided at this meeting to reaffirm the $5 billion ceiling which it\nviewed as providing adequate operational flexibility to respond on\nshort notice to unanticipated developments.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Jordan.\n\nAbsent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and\nMullins.\n\nMr. Jordan dissented because he felt that providing funds to\nthe Treasury using a warehousing arrangement was, in effect, a loan to\nthe Treasury. In his opinion, direct financing of government\noperations by the central bank is inappropriate and could compromise\nthe effective conduct of monetary policy. He did not rule out the\npossible efficacy of some warehousing transactions in very exceptional\ncircumstances in the future, but he believed that the latter should be\napproved only after full Committee discussion. Accordingly, he did\nnot want to retain the standing $5 billion authorization.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 21,\n1993, were approved.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets during the period since the December\nmeeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod December 21, 1993, through February 3, 1994. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in\n1994, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that\neconomic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months\nof 1993, and the limited data available on production and employment\nsuggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year.\nHousing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of\nlast year, and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise.\nIncreases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding\ntheir food and energy components, had been somewhat larger in recent\nmonths than earlier in 1993, and prices of a number of commodities had\nturned up.\n\nAssessment of the January labor market data was complicated\nby statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a\nvariety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening\nin the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted\na small gain in January after a sizable December increase.\nManufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with\ngains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls\nedged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter\nweather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was\nunchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down\nemployment in some segments of this sector as well. The average\nworkweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to\nits highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average\nworkweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third\nconsecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a\nnew basis, was 6.7 percent in January.\n\nIndustrial production increased appreciably further in\nDecember, and the available information suggested a considerable rise\nin January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the\nmotor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases\nin materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the\nother hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was\nsluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space\nequipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing\ncapacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level,\njudged against historical experience.\n\nConsumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption\nexpenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and\nstrong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy\nin consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor\nvehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably\nfurniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered\nfurther large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods\nand services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December,\nwith both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance.\nFor 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total\nin four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and\nsales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in\nthe twenty-five year history of the series.\n\nReal business fixed investment recorded a very large increase\nin the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for\ninformation processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh\nstraight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for\nnondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of\nthese goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in\nthe fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years;\nthe increases were spread across a broad array of categories other\nthan office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the\nfourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in\nnonresidential structures in the near term.\n\nBusiness inventories remained generally well aligned with\nsales through November, the most recent month for which complete data\nwere available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December\nafter edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both\nmonths, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that\nalready were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level,\ninventories rose moderately in November after little change in the\npreceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector\nhad changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded\nsubstantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of\nstocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but\nfor some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores,\nthe increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a\nwhole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November.\n\nThe average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the\nOctober-November period was about the same as its average rate in the\nthird quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period,\nwith the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products,\nand aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period\nreflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of\nconsumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in\neconomic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared\nto have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth\nappeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but\neconomic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned\ndown in Japan, western Germany, and France.\n\nProducer prices of finished goods were down slightly in\nDecember after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and\nenergy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were\nup slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer\nprices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price\ndeclines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items\nother than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a\nslightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year;\nfor 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992.\nHourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the\nfourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993,\nthe rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous\nyear. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers\nrose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January,\nthe increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve\nmonths.\n\nAt its meeting on December 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and\nM3 over the following months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. Additional reserves were supplied to the banking\nsystem on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements\nin currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for\nexcess reserves. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal\nfunds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal\nborrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated.\n\nMost market interest rates declined slightly during the\nintermeeting period, and major indexes of stock prices posted new\nhighs. Market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as\nencouraging; still, they viewed the economy as relatively robust, and\non balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a\npotential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few\nmonths, but probably not in the very near term.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on balance\nover the intermeeting period. The dollar fell against the yen in the\ncontext of somewhat higher Japanese interest rates and renewed\nexpressions of U.S. concern about bilateral trade issues. The dollar\nappreciated slightly relative to the German mark and other European\ncurrencies against the background of relatively strong U.S. economic\ndata and generally sluggish economic activity in continental Europe.\n\nGrowth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little\nfaster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December\nand January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding\ndeposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although\nrecent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate\nthan that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both\nM2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of\nthe Committee's ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent\nmonths, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat\nfaster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the\nyear, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half\nof the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth\nquarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate\nsomewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter\nweather over much of the country and the California earthquake would\ntend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year:\nhowever, taken together, these developments were not expected to have\na material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or\nprices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace\nthe growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate\nmore in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to\ndecelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the\ndiminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower\ngrowth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of\ncapital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved\naffordability of housing and increased confidence in employment\nprospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace\nthrough much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen\nsomewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and\nfiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In\nlight of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets\nthat were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the\nongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight\nfurther reduction in the core rate of inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the economy had entered\nthe new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion\nwas likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat\nabove the economy's long-run potential. The very rapid rate of\neconomic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly\ncould not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion\nstemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment,\nand consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in\nrelation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional\nincreases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994.\nStill, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum,\nlargely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and\ngenerally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly\naccommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members\nexpressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate\ngrowth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the\neconomy, little further progress would be made toward price stability\nin 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some\npoint if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of\ninflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation\ntrends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had\nturned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but\nincreasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying\nslightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the\nproduction process.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nestablishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt\naggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank\npresidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections\nof economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for\n1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat\nfaster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for\n1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to\nfoster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the\nfourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources\nexpected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost\npressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price\nincreases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been\nheld down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the\nforecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4\npercent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of\nthe civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were\nall in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of\nthe new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFor the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered\non increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent,\nand for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2\nto 6 percent for the year.\n\nIn the Committee's review of factors underlying recent\ndevelopments, members observed that generally favorable financial\nconditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion\nin business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic\ngrowth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low\ninterest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier\navailability of financing from lending institutions, and the\nstrengthened financial condition of businesses and households also\nwere cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance\nsheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly,\nand while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made,\nthe latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the\nwillingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to\nincur new debt to finance growing expenditures.\n\nIn their reports on developments across the nation, members\ncommented on widespread indications of improving economic activity,\nincluding some strengthening in regions that earlier were\ncharacterized by stagnant business conditions. Some areas continued\nto be affected adversely by special factors, especially by spending\ncutbacks in defense and aerospace industries. California was a\nnotable example, but a range of indicators suggested that the\nCalifornia economy might be stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level.\nafter an extended period of declining activity. Mirroring these\ndevelopments, business sentiment was characterized as generally\noptimistic around the nation. While business executives remained\ncautious in their hiring practices, the expansion in business activity\nwas fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where\nsome major business concerns were reducing their workforces. A few\nlarge firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were\nnow reported to be hiring additional workers.\n\nTurning to prospective developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer\nexpenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth\nin such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with\ngains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since\nthe holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed\nto continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms\nhad hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail\ncontacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any\nevent, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and\nother consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high\nconsumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was\nnoted in this connection that consumer debt had become more\nconcentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups\nthat were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with\nthe result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional\nindebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some\nhouseholds also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the\nconsumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for\nconsumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked\nimprovement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions\nwould provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in\nconsumer expenditures.\n\nThe improvement in consumer sentiment together with the\navailability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong\ngrowth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and,\nadjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many\nareas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the\neconomy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing\nactivity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other\nbuilding materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were\nreported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new\nhomes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward\npressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high\nlevels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be\nsubstantially below those recorded in recent quarters.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was likely to be sustained by\ncontinuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to\nachieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and\nworld markets. The gains in such investment had been concentrated in\nexpenditures for equipment, and while new orders pointed to further\nbrisk growth in the months ahead, increases in such expenditures were\nlikely to moderate over time. At the same time, growing economic\nactivity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy\nrates, at least in some parts of the country, suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post\nsizable increases over the year. Rebuilding activity following the\nearthquake in California would stimulate engineering and construction\nin the Los Angeles area over the quarters ahead.\n\nFiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects\non the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal\nrestraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were\nexpected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance\nof the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal\npolicy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate\nand to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal\ngovernment expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted\nthat the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal\ngovernment deficits could be expected to continue to contain new\nfederal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S.\nexports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were\nexpected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth\nin major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the\ndemand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member\nalso commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable\neffect on some exports to Mexico.\n\nOne sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of\nparticular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business\nfirms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and\nin general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales.\nIndeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls\nhad resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory\nlevels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product\nmarkets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity\npressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete\nexisting inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to\nincrease them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as\nsignificant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods\npurchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial\ninventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the\nhistory of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large\ninventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting\ninflationary pressures in the economy.\n\nThe members generally expressed concern about a buildup in\ninflationary pressures during the year ahead, especially if what they\ncurrently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were\nmaintained. A number of members emphasized that even with the\nsubstantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic\nexpansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall\nmargins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to\nfairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with\nthe clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation\nwould emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions.\nContinuing upward impetus to food prices, resulting from the adverse\nweather conditions during 1993, and the likelihood that energy prices\nwould not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment\nof somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to\noverall price pressures.\n\nThe members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and\nwages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the\nwhole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends.\nHowever, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was\nthe growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of\nshortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or\noccupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports\nof rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for\nuse in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by\nbusinesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs\nor to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity\nprices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive\nside, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets,\naugmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign\nproducers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between\neconomic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to\nthe extent that the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary\npolicy was maintained.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and\ndebt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis\nat its meeting on July 6-7, 1993. The tentative ranges included\nexpansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of\n1994. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. All of\nthese ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for\n1993: the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing\nincreases in velocity.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the ranges for 1994, which\ntended to focus on M2, all the members expressed a preference for\naffirming the M2 and M3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in July and all but one favored adopting the provisional\nmonitoring range for nonfinancial debt, that member preferred a lower\nrange. Many of the members commented on the uncertainties that\nsurrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the\nCommittee's goals for the economy. They noted that a variety of\ndevelopments had altered the historical relationships between the\nmonetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over\nthe past several years. The resulting uncertainty implied that the\nCommittee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates in relation to their ranges, including the need to\nassess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of\nmonetary growth developments. Nonetheless, the members concluded that\nas best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this\npoint, monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to\npromote the Committee's objectives of sustained economic expansion and\nsubdued inflation.\n\nIn 1993, both M2 and M3 had grown at rates about 1/2 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the Committee now\ncontemplated retaining for 1994. According to a staff analysis\nprepared for this meeting, somewhat faster growth in both of these\naggregates could be expected in 1994. But with nominal GDP also\nexpected to be stronger, as indicated by the central tendency of the\nmembers' forecasts, the velocity of M2 would continue to rise at an\nappreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have\nsuggested. This assessment assumed that households would continue to\nredirect savings from M2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments,\nespecially bond and stock mutual funds. However, such redeployments\nof funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors\nalready had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired\nportfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes\nin the prices of stocks and bonds, including the drop in bond prices\nin recent months, would underline the risks of holding such\ninstruments. Moreover, depository institutions had strengthened their\ncapital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively\nfor M2 and especially for M3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or\nincrease their role in the financing of expanding economic activity.\nWhile these developments and their implications for monetary growth\ncould not be forecast with confidence, the members believed that the\nranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to\naccommodate M2 and M3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity\nscenarios. For example, if the factors that had tended to depress the\ngrowth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as\nexpected this year, M2 and M3 growth would again be near the lower\nbounds of the Committee's ranges. Alternatively, if the behavior of\nthese aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns, growth in\nthe upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance\nin line with the members' forecasts.\n\nFrom the perspective of a longer time horizon, many of the\nmembers noted that the provisional range for M2 was essentially at a\nlevel that could well prove to be consistent with sustained and\nnoninflationary economic expansion. This conclusion assumed that\nhistorical relationships between money growth and the expansion of\nbroad measures of economic performance would be restored at some\npoint. In the absence of such a development or the emergence of new,\nreasonably stable relationships, the Committee would have to continue\nto place diminished reliance on the monetary aggregates in the\nformulation of monetary policy.\n\nWith regard to the range for nonfinancial debt, the members\nanticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range. A staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing\ncomponent would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit\nreduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts\nstemming from economic growth. At the same time, borrowing by the\nnonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of\nmore comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in GDP\nexpansion. In one view, however, a somewhat lower range was desirable\nfor nonfinancial debt. In light of the shift in business preferences\naway from debt and toward equity, debt velocity could increase and\nslower growth in debt would be consistent with the Committee's\nobjectives. However, this member could accept the higher range\nfavored by the other members for 1994.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they favored or could accept the ranges for\n1994 that the Committee had established on a tentative basis at its\nmeeting in July 1993. In keeping with the Committee's usual\nprocedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be\nreviewed at midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the\nbehavior of the aggregates and interim economic and financial\ndevelopments. The Committee approved the following paragraph for\ninclusion in the domestic policy directive:\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\nmeeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth\nquarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that\ndevelopments contributing to unusual velocity increases\ncould persist during the year and that money growth\nwithin these ranges would be consistent with its broad\npolicy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,\nLaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nAbsent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and\nMullins.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less\naccommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with\nregard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture,\nwhich had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly\nstimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly\nnegative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least\nsome members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in\nnarrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been\nappropriate in a period when various developments had tended to\ninhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained\nbalance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that\nhad tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the\nconsiderable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing\ntheir debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions\nof lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context\nof low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity\nthat could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the\nmembers agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more\nneutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without\na buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that\ntimely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous\nand disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were\nallowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had\ndemonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on\neconomic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of\nmembers endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight\nadjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure.\nThese members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well\njustify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however,\nthat even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly\nstrong impact on financial markets because it would be the first\npolicy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening\naction in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a\ncontemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy\naction (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt\nthat a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable\nrisk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively\nsmall move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the\nCommittee's anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further\naction should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation\nexpectations and speculative developments in financial markets.\n\nOther members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater\nfirming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable\nneutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had\ndemonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that\nslow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to\nbuild. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact\nreduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required\nand they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing\ninflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on\nlonger-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy\nstance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and\nprogress toward price stability.\n\nIn further discussion, all the members indicated that they\ncould accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but\nmany observed that additional firming probably would be desirable\nlater. The members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further\npolicy action would be needed during the intermeeting period, and the\nCommittee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting\ninstruction in the directive. In this connection, it was understood\nthat the Committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and\ntake further action, if warranted by intermeeting developments, at a\ntelephone conference during the period ahead.\n\nAt this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a\nproposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee's short-term\npolicy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which\nwould be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any\nmisinterpretation of the Committee's action and its purpose. Because\nthis would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it\nwas likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not\nintend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any\ncommitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future.\nThat matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the\ndisclosure of Committee information at a later meeting.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they could support a directive that called for\na slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the\nCommittee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\nslightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicates\na strong advance in economic activity during the\nclosing months of 1993, and the limited data available\nfor the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable\nfurther gains. The January labor market data were\ncomplicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of\nindicators pointed convincingly to a continuing\nexpansion of employment. Industrial production\nincreased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to\nhave risen considerably further in January. Consumer\nspending and housing activity posted solid gains in\nlate 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in\nJanuary suggested continued buoyancy in consumer\ndemand. Trends in contracts and orders point to\nfurther sizable gains in business fixed investment.\nThe average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in\nOctober-November was about the same as its average rate\nin the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993,\nincreases in broad indexes of consumer and producer\nprices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and\nprices of a number of commodities also turned up\nrecently.\n\nMost market interest rates have declined slightly\nsince the Committee meeting on December 21. 1993. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is\nabout unchanged over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over\nDecember and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992\nto the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated\nto have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of\nthe Committee's ranges for the year. Private borrowing\nhas picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the\nfourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is\nestimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half\nof the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions. In\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the\nfirst half of 1994.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan. Kelley,\nLaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nAbsent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and\nMullins.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, March 22, 1994.\nThe meeting adjourned at 11:45 a.m.\n\nSecretary\n\nFOMC"
