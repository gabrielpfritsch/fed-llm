The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most\nrecent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:\n\n(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities\nof the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations\nof, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of\nthe United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and\nforeign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System\nOpen Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange\nmaturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury\nor the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;\nprovided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal agency\nsecurities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the\nclose of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action\nis taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased\nor decreased by more than $12.0 billion during the period commencing with\nthe opening of business on the day following such a meeting and ending\nwith the close of business on the day of the next such meeting;\n\n(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations\nof, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of\nthe United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or\nobligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise\nexpressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive\nbidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements\nwith individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities\nor agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by\nthe dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall\nbe sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.\n\n(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct\nobligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any\nagency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account\nunder agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations\nin 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly\nauthorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding,\nafter applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with\nindividual dealers.\n\n2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held\nin the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined\nby competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set\na minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and\napply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that\nmay be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may\nborrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could\nfacilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined\nsolely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\n3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations,\nwhile assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign\nand international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as\nfiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal\nReserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account,\nto sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth\nin paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts\nof those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to\nthose available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York\nBank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to\nthe conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph\nl(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities,\nand to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its\nown account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency accounts\nmaintained at the Bank.

In the execution of the Committee’s decision regarding policy\nduring any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman\nof the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal\nfunds rate. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee’s\ndiscussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,\nand shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during\nthe intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman,\nif feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.\n\nThe amendment to the authorization for domestic open market operations\ninvolved the addition of a reference in paragraph 3 to accounts held at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York pursuant to fiscal agency instructions\nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury. Accounts listed in paragraph 3, which\ninclude those maintained by the Bank on behalf of official foreign and\ninternational accounts, are eligible for participation in the Bank’s\nshort-term investment facility, the so-called “repo pool.” By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was\nreaffirmed in the form shown below.\n\nAUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS\n\n1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent\nnecessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and\nexpress authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity\nwith such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time\nto time:\n\nA. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form\nof cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market\nat home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with\nthe U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the\nGold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the\nBank for International Settlements, and with other international financial\ninstitutions:\n\nCanadian dollars Danish kroner Euro Pounds sterling Japanese yen Mexican pesos Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs\n\nB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to\nreceive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.\n\nC. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars\nunder the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below,\nprovided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be\nfully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that\ntime was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances,\nspecifically authorizes a delay.\n\nD. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not\nexceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in\nall foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net\npositions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign\ncurrency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding\ncontracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery\nof that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to\nsign.\n\n2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"\narrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum\nof 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated\nby the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section\n214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with\nthe approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:\n\nForeign bank\n\nAmount of arrangement (millions of dollars equivalent)\n\nBank of Canada\n\n2,000\n\nBank of Mexico\n\n3,000\n\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed\nterms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred\nfor review and approval to the Committee.\n\n3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph\n1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee,\nbe at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment\nreturn on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of\nadjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings,\ntransactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market\nexchange rates.\n\n4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks\nfor the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating\narrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign\ncurrencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself\nto maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration\nof the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with\nthe foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5\nof Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.\n\n5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate\nliquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency\nportfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18\nmonths (calculated as Macaulay duration). When appropriate in connection\nwith arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency\nholdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central\nbanks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar\ndays.\n\n6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall\nbe reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.\nThe Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman\nof the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such\nother member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence\nof members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members\ndesignated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice\nChairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee\nshall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the\nManager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes\nof reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with\nthe Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the\nrequest of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such\nreviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\n7. The Chairman is authorized:\n\nA. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement\nor understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division\nof responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and\nthe Treasury;\n\nB. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System\nforeign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy\nmatters relating to foreign currency operations;\n\nC. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information\nto the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial\nPolicies.\n\n8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent\ninformation on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials\nof the Treasury Department.\n\n9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency\noperations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the\nBoard of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships\nof Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in\nthe form shown below.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE\n\n1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed\nat countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar\nreflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.\n\n2.

For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.\n\n4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:\n\nA. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United\nStates Treasury;\n\nB. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities;\nand\n\nC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States\nin the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under\nIMF Article IV.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign\nCurrency\n\nOperations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.\n\nPROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS\n\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction\nof the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization\nfor Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market\nAccount (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural\nunderstandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee,\nthe Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.\nAll operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported\npromptly to the Committee.\n\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman,\nif the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the\ntime available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall\nopen position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the\nmost recent regular meeting of the Committee.\n\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's\nnet position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the\noperation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.\n\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading\nin a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that\ncurrency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.\n\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger\nof (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee,\nif the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in\nthe time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee\nis not feasible in the time available):\n\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall\nopen position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting\nof the Committee.\n\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger\nof (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.\n\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman\nabout proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine\ncharacter.\n\nOn January 9, 2004, the continuing rules, regulations, and other instructions\nof the Committee had been distributed with the advice that, in accordance\nwith procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the\nCommittee's attention before the January 27-28 organization meeting to\ngive members an opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning\nthem. Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the\ninstruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this\nmeeting, and no requests for consideration were received. Accordingly,\nall of these instruments remained in effect in their existing form.\n\nThe Committee considered a report from the Manager of the System Open\nMarket Account that discussed the feasibility and costs of purchasing\nmortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (GNMA), a federal government agency. A potential advantage\nof transactions in such GNMA obligations was their use to supplement purchases\nof direct Treasury securities in periods when large federal surpluses\nreduced market supplies of Treasury debt. However, the resumption of large\nfederal deficits had led to sizable increases in market supplies of Treasury\nobligations, which members saw as the preferred vehicle to supply the\nneed for permanent additions to the System Open Market Account. The report\nconcluded that outright transactions in mortgage-backed GNMA securities\nwere feasible but would involve sizeable start-up costs and would tend\nto complicate the conduct of System open market operations. Against this\nbackground the Committee decided not to initiate outright transactions\nin mortgage-backed GNMA obligations. It was understood, however, that\nsuch GNMA obligations would continue to be eligible as collateral for\nSystem repurchase agreements.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee held on December 9, 2003, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments\nin foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign\ncurrencies for the System's Account in the period since the previous meeting.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets\nand on System open market transactions in government securities and federal\nagency obligations during the period December 9, 2003 to January 27, 2004.\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nAt this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion\nof its communication practices.\n\nA portion of this discussion focused on the report of a working group\nthat had been directed to study how the Committee’s announcements\nmight be improved. In the course of the discussion, members stressed the\nimportance that they attached to conveying clearly to the public information\nregarding the reasons for policy decisions and how those decisions related\nto the Committee’s longer-term objectives. However, only limited\nsupport emerged for the use of particular standard wording to express\nthe Committee’s appraisals of the economic outlook and views about\nthe balance of risks. Indeed, several members were in favor of discontinuing\nthe use of statements regarding the balance of risks to the outlook and\ninstead focusing mostly on the reasons for their policy decisions in the\nannouncement. At the same time, all the members indicated that they could\nsupport a flexible approach in which the wording of the Committee’s\nannouncements, including the assessment of the balance of risks going\nforward, would be adjusted gradually over time in keeping with evolving\neconomic conditions.\n\nIn further discussion the members reviewed the potential value and drawbacks\nof accelerating the publication of Committee minutes. Possible benefits\nwould include the provision of more complete information sooner after\nmeetings on the considerations that led the Committee to adopt the current\nstance of policy. Some members expressed concern, however, that accelerated\nrelease of the minutes might have the potential to feed back adversely\non the deliberations of the Committee and on the minutes themselves. The\nmembers also emphasized the importance of allowing sufficient time for\nthem to review and comment on the minutes and for reconciling differences\nof opinion among the members of a large and geographically dispersed committee.\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, staff was asked to study the issue\nfurther.\n\nThe members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes\nin the content, time horizon, and frequency of the individual forecasts\nthat are summarized in the semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports to the\nCongress. In general, the members saw little to be gained by altering\nthe Committee’s current practices in any significant way, although\nsome proposed relatively minor changes. It was agreed that there was no\nneed to reach a decision on such changes at this time, but staff was instructed\nto ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making\npossible minor adjustments to current procedures.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and\nthe conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.\n\nThe economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth\nquarter, though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third\nquarter. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over\nthe final three months of the year, and activity in the residential sector\nremained at a very high level. On the business side, outlays for equipment\nand software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter, and firms\napparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters.\nDespite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving\nonly slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the\nfourth quarter. Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation\nexpectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003.\n\nThe December employment report suggested that the labor market had not\ngained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way. Private\nnonfarm payrolls increased only slightly in that month, and their level\nin November was revised down appreciably. The average monthly increase\nin employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery\nin the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average\nmonthly loss during the first half of the year. Manufacturing payrolls\ncontinued to shrink in December at about the same pace as in the previous\nfew months, and holiday-related hiring in retail trade was below average.\nIn other sectors, job gains were recorded in construction, education and\nhealth services, and professional and business services. Average weekly\nhours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined somewhat in December,\nreversing the gains of the previous two months. Aggregate hours worked\nby nonfarm employees fell in December but in the fourth quarter as a whole\nposted their first quarterly increase since 2000. Despite the weak payroll\ndata, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey,\nfell to 5.7 percent in December, in part because of a further decline\nin the labor force participation rate. Initial claims for unemployment\ninsurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference\nweek for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth\nin January.\n\nThe pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth\nquarter. Total industrial production rose at the fastest rate since the\nsecond quarter of 2002, and manufacturing production posted solid and\nwidespread gains. High-tech industries, including those producing semiconductors,\ncomputers, and communications equipment, accounted for nearly one-third\nof the increase in total industrial production in the fourth quarter.\nAfter having surged in the third quarter, the production of motor vehicles\nand parts moved up in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as overall\nmanufacturing. Outside the manufacturing sector, output at mines increased\nmodestly in the quarter, while output at utilities rose appreciably, led\nby a solid advance in electricity generation that mirrored the strengthening\nin the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilization was unchanged in December\nand remained well below its long-term average.\n\nSales of light vehicles jumped in December, and the fourth-quarter average,\nalthough below the torrid third-quarter pace, was well above that recorded\nfor the first half of the year. These data, along with those on retail\nsales excluding autos, were consistent with a solid increase in real personal\nconsumption expenditures in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal\nincome advanced smartly in November. Spending was also supported by the\nrecent stock market gains, and by greater consumer confidence as reflected\nin the Michigan Survey Research Center’s index of consumer sentiment\nand the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence, both of\nwhich stood significantly above their average readings for 2003.\n\nActivity in the housing market remained very robust. In December, single-family\nstarts edged down only a bit from the exceptional rate they had reached\nin November, and multifamily starts moved up to the highest level in almost\nfour years. New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive\nmonth, but they were still not far below the record highs registered earlier\nin the year. Existing home sales had fallen back from September’s\nhigh, though the level in November was still noticeably higher than average\nmonthly sales in the first half of 2003.\n\nThe available data suggested that business purchases of transportation\nequipment strengthened in the fourth quarter and that spending on other\ncapital goods advanced at a moderate pace. Business expenditures on aircraft\nrebounded noticeably in the fourth quarter, albeit to a level that was\nstill far below the levels that prevailed before the downturn following\nthe terrorist attacks in 2001. Both fleet sales of light vehicles and\ntruck sales also rose significantly. In the high-tech sector, real outlays\nfor computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted\nsizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications\nequipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth.\nOutside transportation and high tech, nominal shipments were about unchanged\nin the fourth quarter, but the upward trend in orders established since\nthe beginning of last year was consistent with further gains in spending.\nAfter holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real\nspending on private nonresidential construction appeared to have slipped\nfurther in the third and fourth quarters. In the commercial and health-care\nsector and in the manufacturing sector, average nominal outlays in October\nand November were about unchanged from the previous quarter. However,\nspending on other types of construction moved down.\n\nThe book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor\nvehicles posted the third consecutive significant monthly increase in\nNovember. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little on average in October\nand November, but non-auto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories\nat a brisk pace. Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-sales\nratios at or near their recent lows. Motor vehicle and parts inventories\nended the year noticeably above the level at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe international trade deficit in November shrank to its lowest level\nin about a year. Exports of goods and services increased to a level not\nrecorded since early 2001, while imports fell moderately. Recent data\nindicated that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign industrial\ncountries continued in the fourth quarter. Japanese exports, machinery\norders, and industrial production rose strongly in October and November.\nEuro-area manufacturing data exhibited increasing strength, particularly\nin Germany. In the United Kingdom, indicators of business and retail sales\nin December pointed to a maintained expansion. And Canadian employment\nand sales data were strong in the fourth quarter, with the housing sector\ncontinuing to make a significant contribution to growth.\n\nPrices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued\nto decelerate through the end of 2003. Overall consumer prices were flat,\non balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices\nand a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy\nprices. Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase\nthat was noticeably below that in the previous year. Core consumer prices\ndecelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year. Producer\nprices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance\nwas substantially above that over the previous year. The rise last year\nwas due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices\nas core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over\n2002. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production\nor nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in\nthe twelve months ending in December, an increase somewhat below that\nover 2002.\n\nAt its meeting on December 9, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve\nmarkets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.\nIn reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the\nupside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for\nthe next few quarters to be roughly equal. They also judged that the probability\nof an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and\nnow appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Nevertheless,\nwith inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed\nthat policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.\n\nThe Committee’s decision at the December meeting to keep its target\nfor the federal funds rate at 1 percent appeared to have been fully anticipated\nin financial markets, and interest rate futures for the first half of\n2004 were essentially unchanged after the announcement. But futures rates\nfor the second half of the year rose a few basis points, presumably in\nresponse to the Committee’s assessment that the probability of an\nunwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level\nalmost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Subsequently, however, the\nrelease of the minutes for the October FOMC meeting, which indicated that\nat that time the Committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent\nslack arising from rapid productivity growth, and the publication of surprisingly\nmodest growth in employment in December led most market participants to\npush back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months\nto some time in the fall. Reflecting the change in policy expectations,\nintermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially\nover the intermeeting period. Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell by\nnearly as much, suggesting that the drop in nominal yields owed more to\nlower real interest rates than to reduced inflation compensation. Yields\non investment-grade and most speculative-grade securities moved down by\nabout the same amount as Treasury yields. Major equity indexes rose strongly\nin response to the declines in yields and positive news about the outlook\nfor profits.\n\nThe exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies\nindex, declined moderately on net over the intermeeting period. Ongoing\ninvestor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its\ncurrent account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting\npressure on the dollar.\n\nM2 fell in December, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The decline\nin M2 over the fourth quarter was the largest on record since the start\nof consistent data collection in 1959. The weakness was concentrated in\nliquid deposits and, to a lesser extent, in retail money market mutual\nfunds and appeared to be due in large part to the unwinding of a previous\nbuildup in deposits associated with heavy mortgage refinancing activity\nand to portfolio shifts by households into equities.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum\nin economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would\ncarry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing\ngains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement\nin labor market conditions. The considerable stimulus being provided by\nfiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on\na solid uptrend. In addition, improving labor market conditions and the\neffects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected\nto support household spending, while business investment spending was\nseen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output,\nswelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions. Some slight\ndownward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in\nthe forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets.\n\nIn the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic\ndevelopments, the members commented that the information that had become\navailable since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier\nassessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic\ngrowth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the\nyear progressed. Many emphasized that business expenditures now appeared\nto be on a solid upward trajectory amid widespread reports of much improved\nbusiness sentiment. Indeed, business expenditures had broadened the sources\nof significant strength in the expansion, which earlier had been sustained\nmainly by household and government spending. Factors underlying a favorable\noutlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal\nand monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets,\nand the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business\ninvestment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes. The members\nnonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic\nactivity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in\nemployment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor\nmarkets. Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth,\nthey saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward.\nRegarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins\nof slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and\nprices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity. Core\nconsumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number\nof members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such\ninflation from its current subdued level. Over the year ahead, however,\nthe members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price\ninflation.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserve’s\nsemi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy,\nthe members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal\nReserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP,\nthe rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004.\nThe forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth\nin economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite\nlow rate of inflation. Specifically, the forecasts of the expansion in\nreal GDP between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of\n2004 had a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent and a full range of\n4 to 5-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate\nin the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.\nForecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the\nPCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent,\nwith a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent.\n\nIn their discussion of developments across the nation, members emphasized\ngrowing indications of rising business confidence and, despite persisting\nsoftness in a number of industries, more widespread signs of increasing\nbusiness spending for equipment and software and for inventories. The\nmembers cited a variety of factors that pointed to a further pickup in\nbusiness capital expenditures over the coming year, including the strength\nin new orders and shipments, increasing profits and cash flow, the improved\nfinancial condition of many business firms, the general availability of\nfinancing on favorable terms, and the temporary tax incentive on expenditures\nfor new equipment. Anecdotal reports from business contacts about capital\nspending plans were indicative of appreciable further acceleration in\nbusiness expenditures on a widening range of capital goods. While many\ncontacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities\nprovided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors\nin guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment\nspending to expand capacity.\n\nThe members also viewed business inventory investment as likely to provide\nsome support to the economic expansion over the year ahead. Business inventories\nwere at exceptionally low levels in relation to sales, and if further\nbrisk growth in demand broadly in line with current forecasts materialized\nthis year, business firms could be expected to make commensurate additions\nto their inventories. Indeed, inventories appeared to have turned up in\nthe fourth quarter after declining on balance earlier in 2003 as businesses\nevidently became more confident that increases in their sales would be\nsustained.\n\nWhile business expenditures had turned up, employers had continued to\ndisplay a high degree of caution in hiring new workers. Employment had\ntrended up since mid-2003 after a protracted period of job losses, but\nthe gains were significantly weaker than was typical at similar stages\nof earlier business cycles. A key factor that had tended to hold down\nhiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing\ndemand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than\nhiring new workers. Against this background, labor markets continued to\nbe described as soft in most areas, albeit with more signs of at least\nmodest improvement. In this regard, members referred to positive developments\nsuch as the decline in initial claims and the rise in aggregate hours\nworked in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the members saw considerably\nfaster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further\nstrengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in\nthe growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters.\nSeveral emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement\nin employment were subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nThe household sector was continuing to supply major impetus to the expansion.\nHousehold spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary\npolicies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices,\nand increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook. Members\nnoted that retailers in many parts of the country reported solid sales\nduring the holiday period. With respect to the outlook for overall consumer\nspending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could\nbe expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption\neven as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded. Residential construction\nactivity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent\ndeclines in mortgage interest rates. Contacts in the housing industry\nindicated that they expected a high level of construction activity in\n2004, though perhaps not as robust as in 2003.\n\nFiscal policy was providing considerable stimulus to the economy and\nwould continue to do so in the first part of this year, reflecting the\nlarge tax refunds anticipated as a result of overwithholdings in 2003.\nBeyond the nearer term, however, the fiscal stimulus was projected to\ndiminish under existing legislation. In this regard, one member questioned\nwhether a robust expansion would be sustained once the fiscal impulse\nwas removed. Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects\nfor large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance\nof the economy.\n\nIn their comments about the international economy, members noted that\nthe strengthening in economic activity abroad and the decline in the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar had boosted exports. Even so, the ongoing\nstrength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and\nnet exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic\nactivity over the year ahead. Some members indicated that they were concerned\nabout the implications of the nation’s rapidly growing external\ndebt for domestic financial markets and the economy over time.\n\nIn the Committee’s discussion of the outlook for inflation, the\nmembers agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain\nmuted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually\nreducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity\nexerting downward pressure on costs and prices. Some members commented,\nhowever, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was\nquite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.\nAccordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price\ninflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion\nabout the most probable direction. In the view of many, some modest further\ndisinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect. A few members noted\nthat such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity,\ncould be viewed as non-threatening. Moreover, the expected strength in\naggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time. A few\nmembers expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well\nedge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus\nstemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility\nthat the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially\nif it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated\nwith slower growth in productivity. The evidence pointing to the possibility\nof an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted\nthat in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities\nincluding oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms\nhad been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher\nlevels in an effort to pass on increases in costs. Overall, however, the\npricing power of business firms remained quite limited.\n\nIn the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period\nahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance that was directed\ntoward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with a target federal\nfunds rate of 1 percent. While the members were persuaded that a relatively\nvigorous economic expansion was now firmly established and was likely\nat some point to call for a move toward a more neutral policy stance,\nthey concluded that such an adjustment was not warranted under current\ncircumstances. In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other\nresources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level,\nand that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction\nover the year ahead. Members acknowledged that there were risks in maintaining\nwhat might eventually prove to be an overly accommodative policy stance,\nbut for now they judged that it was desirable to take risks on the side\nof assuring the rapid elimination of economic slack.\n\nWith regard to the wording of the Committee’s press statement\nto be released shortly after the meeting, members discussed at some length\nthe desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the\nprospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained “for a\nconsiderable period.” The existing language had been explicitly\nqualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack\nin resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from\nthe current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions\nrather than simply on the passage of time. All the members agreed that\na change in wording was desirable, not to signal a policy tightening move\nin the near term, but rather to increase the Committee’s flexibility\nto take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline\nthat any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic\nconditions. However, some differences of opinion arose with regard to\nthe specific proposal under consideration, namely to remove the reference\nto “considerable period” and to substitute one referring to\n“patience.” Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed\nthat the new wording conveyed important information about the Committee’s\nstrategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under\nthose circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial\nmarkets. A number of members commented that expectations of sustained\npolicy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial\nmarkets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording\nmight prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic\ncircumstances in the future. A few members, while expressing agreement\nwith respect to the merits of a language change, nonetheless preferred\nto drop the reference to a “considerable period’’ entirely\nwithout substituting a reference to the Committee’s ability to be\npatient. In this view, even the replacement language would tend to shape\nexpectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy, and\nwith the economy in a strong uptrend, the Committee no longer needed to\nutilize such special language.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee voted to authorize and\ndirect the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,\nto execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions\nthat will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.\nTo further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future\nseeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the\nfederal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.\n\nThe vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in\nthe press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\n\nThe Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the\nattainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly\nequal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished\nin recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.\nWith inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes\nthat it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,\nBernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kohn, Ms. Minehan,\nMr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole.\n\nVote against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nTuesday, March 16, 2004.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:45 p.m. on January 28, 2004.\n\nAttended Wednesday's\nsession only.\nAttended portion of meeting\nrelating to the Committee's review of the economic outlook.\nSecretary’s note: Advice subsequently was received that the selection\nof Mr. Kos as Manager was satisfactory to the board of directors of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York."
