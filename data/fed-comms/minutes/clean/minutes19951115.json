Did not attend portion of meeting covering the monetary policy discussion.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on September 26, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign\ncurrency transactions during the period September 26, 1995, through\nNovember 14, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these\ntransactions.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period September\n26, 1995, through November 14, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal for\nan additional one-year period of the System's reciprocal currency\n(\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks and the Bank for\nInternational Settlements that were due to mature on various dates in\nDecember 1995. The renewal encompassed all the System's swap\narrangements except that with the Bank of Mexico, which is scheduled\nto mature on January 31, 1996, and will be considered at a later\nmeeting. The amounts and maturity dates of the arrangements approved\nfor renewal are shown in the table that follows:\n\nForeign bank\n\nAmount of arrangement (millions of $ equivalent)\n\nTerm (months)\n\nMaturity date\n\nAustrian National Bank\n\n$ 250.0\n\n12 mos.\n\n12/04/95\n\nBank of England\n\n3,000.0\n\nBank of Japan\n\n5,000.0\n\nBank of Norway\n\n250.0\n\nBank of Sweden\n\n300.0\n\nSwiss National Bank\n\n4,000.0\n\nBank for International Settlements --\n\nSwiss francs\n\n600.0\n\nOther authorized European currencies\n\n1,250.0\n\nNational Bank of Belgium\n\n1,000.0\n\n12/18/95\n\nBank of Canada\n\n2,000.0\n\n12/28/95\n\nNational Bank of Denmark\n\nBank of France\n\nGerman Federal Bank\n\n6,000.0\n\nBank of Italy\n\nNetherlands Bank\n\n500.0\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information available at the time of the meeting was\nmixed, but on balance it suggested a more moderate rate of expansion\nof economic activity after a strong gain during the summer. Consumer\nspending had turned sluggish recently; but with order backlogs still\nlarge, business spending for durable equipment was continuing at a\nrobust if somewhat less rapid rate, and the sizable rise in housing\nstarts in the third quarter presaged higher residential construction\noutlays. Appreciable increases in employment and hours worked tended\nto confirm that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace,\nalthough manufacturing activity had weakened a little. Consumer and\nproducer prices had risen more slowly on average in recent months\nafter having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the\nyear, and growth in labor costs had slowed further.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment, though held down somewhat by the\nonset of a labor strike in the aircraft industry, increased in October\nat the average monthly pace of the third quarter; in addition,\naggregate hours worked by private production workers rose appreciably\nfurther. Construction payrolls recorded another sizable advance. The\nrate of job growth in the services industry slowed a little further,\nreflecting a decline in employment in personnel supply services after\ntwo months of strong advances. Manufacturing employment declined\nagain. The civilian unemployment rate edged down in October to 5.5\npercent.\n\nIndustrial production fell somewhat in October after having\nrisen appreciably in the third quarter; most of the loss reflected the\nstrike in the aircraft industry, but motor vehicle production and\nmining output also recorded substantial declines. In contrast,\nproduction of information processing equipment continued to rise at a\nrapid pace. Total utilization of industrial capacity contracted in\nOctober, with declines widespread across industries.\n\nTotal nominal retail sales, which had expanded relatively\nbriskly over the second and third quarters, fell in October. As part\nof a pattern of widespread weakness in October, purchases at furniture\nand appliance stores were down appreciably after large gains in\nearlier months, and sales at general merchandise and apparel outlets\nreversed most of their sizable September increases. Housing demand\nand construction activity firmed in the third quarter: Sales of both\nnew and existing homes posted solid advances, and single-family\nhousing starts rose considerably, though multifamily starts remained\nsluggish.\n\nBusiness investment in both equipment and structures expanded\nless rapidly in the third quarter. Stepped-up shipments of nondefense\ncapital goods in August and September more than offset a sharp drop in\nshipments in July, but the quarterly average gain was significantly\nsmaller than the increases recorded in the previous two quarters.\nAlthough orders for nondefense capital goods also rose more slowly in\nthe third quarter, the still-sizable order backlogs pointed to\nsubstantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near\nterm. Nonresidential construction increased appreciably further in\nthe third quarter, reflecting a surge in office and institutional\nbuilding activity.\n\nAvailable data suggested a reduction in business inventory\naccumulation in August and September. In manufacturing, the pace of\nstockbuilding slowed in the third quarter from the brisk rate of the\nfirst half of the year, leaving the factory stock-shipments ratio\nunchanged in the third quarter and a little above historic lows. In\nthe wholesale sector, inventories were drawn down in August and\nSeptember after sizable buildups in earlier months; with sales weak,\nthe aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in the\nthird quarter and was at the upper end of its range for recent years.\nRetail inventories expanded significantly in August (latest data\navailable), but the stockbuilding was generally in line with sales and\nthe ratio of inventories to sales remained near the middle of its\nrange in recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed markedly in August; for July and August-combined, the deficit\nwas significantly smaller than its average rate in the second quarter.\nThe value of exports declined over the two-month period, with\nincreases in exports of computers and agricultural products more than\noffset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and service\nreceipts. Imports fell more than exports; with the notable exception\nof computers and semiconductors, declines were recorded in most major\nimport categories. Available data indicated that economic expansion\nremained subdued in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth\ncontinued to slow in the European economies other than Italy, and the\nJapanese economy showed little evidence of a sustained recovery.\n\nConsumer prices rose at a slightly faster rate in October;\nwith a smaller increase in food prices offsetting higher energy\nprices, the index for items other than food and energy also picked up\na little. For the four months ending in October, prices for nonfood,\nnon-energy items advanced at a rate well below that of earlier in the\nyear. Producer prices of finished goods edged down in October,\nreflecting a further decline in the prices of finished energy goods.\nExcluding food and energy, producer prices were unchanged in October\nand increased at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the first\nhalf of the year. Growth in total nominal hourly compensation of\nprivate industry workers slowed in the third quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, continued to trend down: the decrease in compensation\ngrowth over the past year spanned most major occupations and\nindustries.\n\nAt its meeting on September 26, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of\nthe year at a pace near that experienced in recent months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-3/4\npercent, apart from a temporary rise around the end of the third\nquarter. Other short-term market rates also changed little on\nbalance; market participants continued to anticipate an easing of\nmonetary policy at some point but apparently viewed the chances of\nnear-term easing as small. Longer-term interest rates declined\nfurther over the intermeeting period, perhaps in response to a growing\nconviction that inflation pressures would remain subdued and that\nsubstantial reductions in fiscal deficits would be achieved over a\nperiod of years. The lower longer-term interest rates, coupled with\ncontinuing reports of strong corporate earnings, helped lift major\nindexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in\nterms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nExpansion of the broad monetary aggregates weakened in\nOctober. M2 was unchanged in October after having grown relatively\nrapidly in the third quarter and despite the persistence of low\nopportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets. For the year\nthrough October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of the\nCommittee's range for this aggregate in 1995. Growth of M3 apparently\nwas held down somewhat by the reduced need for additional bank funding\nduring a time of sluggish loan demand; for the year to date, M3 grew\nat a rate a little above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt\nhad risen more slowly in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion\nof both private and federal borrowing. Nonetheless, for the year to\ndate, this measure of debt remained around the midpoint of its\nmonitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe growth of economic activity would slow from the strong third-quarter pace to a rate more in line with the increase in the economy's\npotential. The forecast assumed that the favorable interest-rate and\nwealth effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets\nwould provide support for a moderate advance in final sales. Consumer\nspending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the\ngrowth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial\nassets held by households would be offset to some extent by the\ndifficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their\ngrowing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the\nearlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain\nhomebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In anticipation of\nreduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new\nequipment and structures was projected to slow appreciably from the\nvery rapid pace of the past few years. Strong export expansion would\nbe associated with the improving outlook for the economies of major\ntrading partners. Although substantial uncertainty still surrounded\nthe fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate a\nconsiderable degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment,\nwage and price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from\nrecent levels.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, members commented that recent\nstatistical and anecdotal information pointed on balance to an\nappreciable slowing in the economic expansion, which had displayed\nunexpected strength during the summer months. There was some mix of\nviews among the members concerning how far the slowing might proceed,\nthough they generally viewed moderate growth as the most likely course\nfor the economy. A number of members believed that growth around\npotential was a probable outcome, with business activity sustained in\npart by the favorable developments this year in the bond and stock\nmarkets. Other members expressed concern about some signs of further\nebbing in the strength of final demands, and they envisaged the\npossible need for a policy adjustment at some point to sustain\ncontinued moderate growth. With regard to inflation, members noted\nthat despite generally high levels of resource use, including tight\nlabor markets in many parts of the country, inflation had been more\nsubdued than many had expected over the past several months. A number\nof members commented that they saw a basis in this development for\nmild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed\nconcern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic\nactivity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward\nlower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed\nthere was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported\non uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and\namong industries. On balance, modest to moderate growth appeared to\ncharacterize most regions, with overall levels of activity ranging\nfrom relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in\nothers. The mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing\nwhere numerous producers faced lagging demands while others,\nparticularly in high-tech industries, found it difficult to satisfy\nstrong demands for their products. More generally, the industrial\nsector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time, including\na slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for October, but\nrecent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not\ndecisive omen in the outlook for industrial production. In other\nsectors of the economy, members observed that tourism displayed\nconsiderable strength in many areas, while cattle operations and\nenergy production were adversely affected by high production costs or\nlow prices.\n\nIn their review of developments in key demand sectors of the\neconomy, members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a\nfirm growth trend, though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles\nin recent months and a decline in total retail sales in October had\nintroduced a cautionary note. It was suggested that the performance\nof retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone\nfor the longer-term trend in such sales, and in this respect available\ndata and anecdotal reports covering the first part of November were\nsomewhat promising. More generally, further growth in consumer\nspending, though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past\nyear, appeared likely. Such growth would be supported by moderate\nexpansion in incomes and by the favorable effects on household wealth\nand confidence of the substantial improvement in the value of\nfinancial assets this year and the ready availability of financing on\nrelatively attractive terms. Consumer confidence currently seemed to\nbe at a fairly high level, albeit not uniformly so across the country,\nand at least for the quarters immediately ahead, anticipated strength\nin homebuilding should induce spending for many household durables.\nOn the negative side, some members emphasized that the growth in\nconsumer debt was likely to exert an increasingly inhibiting effect on\nconsumer spending. Moreover, the satisfaction of earlier pent-up\ndemands might well limit sales of many consumer durables, notably\nmotor vehicles, in coming quarters. In one view, the projected growth\nin personal incomes and the increases that had occurred this year in\nthe value of household holdings of financial assets would provide\nrelatively little stimulus to consumer spending because the\ndistribution of such gains was heavily tilted toward consumers in\nhigher income or older age groups.\n\nFurther sizable growth in business fixed investment, but at a\npace well below that experienced in recent years, was expected to\nprovide appreciable impetus to the expansion over the next several\nquarters. Favorable factors in the outlook for business capital\nspending included a desire to upgrade technological capabilities for\ncompetitive reasons, strong business earnings and cash flows, and an\nample availability of financing on relatively liberal terms.\nDeclining office vacancy rates in a number of areas would help to\nsupport office construction, and several members also commented on the\nstrength in commercial and other nonresidential building activity in\nvarious parts of the country.\n\nOngoing efforts by many business firms to bring inventories into better alignment with sales had resulted in declining inventory investment since earlier in the year. Some further inventory adjustments, notably in stocks of motor vehicles, were expected over coming months, though not at a pace that would have a marked retarding effect on economic activity. Over much of 1996, inventory investment was projected to be a more neutral factor in the economy, with accumulation proceeding at a pace in line with growth in final sales, but the risks of unexpected developments in this sector of the economy were always substantial.\n\nThe outlook for fiscal policy remained obscured by the\nuncertain outcome of the current debate between the Congress and the\nAdministration. While substantial fiscal restraint aimed at\neventually balancing the budget appeared to be the likely result, the\ntiming of the implementation of various tax and expenditure\ninitiatives and the resulting extent of the fiscal restraint over the\nforecast period could not be anticipated with any degree of precision.\nFor the nearer term, the ongoing shutdown of much of the federal\ngovernment presented a downside risk to the expansion whose effects\nwould depend on the presently uncertain duration of the shutdown and\nthe potential unsettlement in financial markets that might develop at\nsome point. The members generally believed, however, that in light of\nthe underlying strength of the economy, the retarding effects of\nlikely federal budget developments would not be sufficient in\nthemselves to arrest the expansion over the forecast period, at least\nif the federal government shutdown were of relatively short duration\nand a federal debt default were averted.\n\nThe nation's foreign trade deficit had worsened substantially\nduring the past several years, but current forecasts did not point to\nfurther deterioration over the projection period. An anticipated\nfirming in the economies of major U.S. trading partners was expected\nto bolster exports. Several members questioned, however, the extent\nto which forecasts of strengthening economic activity were likely to\nmaterialize in a number of these countries, and they suggested that\nthe foreign sector might well remain a somewhat constraining factor in\nthe performance of the domestic economy.\n\nMembers welcomed the generally favorable price and cost\ndevelopments of recent months and the related indications that\ncurrently high levels of resource use did not appear to be associated\nwith rising inflationary pressures. Many emphasized the persistence\nof subdued increases in labor costs, and a number provided supporting\nanecdotal indications of relatively small advances in labor compensation in many parts of the country despite tight labor markets. The\nanecdotal reports also continued to suggest that strong competition\nwas holding down price inflation and that producers were benefiting\nfrom soft prices of industrial materials. While a number of members\nbelieved that these developments might augur a modest decline in\ninflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate\neconomic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little\nor no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some\nexpressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate\nof inflation. An underlying factor in the relatively favorable\nclimate for inflation was the continued limited rise in the costs of\nworker benefits. In the view of some members, however, benefit costs\nwere likely to be less well contained as time went on and further\nmajor gains in curbing such costs became more difficult to achieve.\nMoreover, worker willingness to accept relatively limited increases in\nwages and other compensation might well begin to erode as concerns\nabout job security tended to diminish after an extended period of\nrelatively low unemployment. On balance, recent experience had raised\nquestions about the relationship between levels of resource use and\ninflation that warranted careful monitoring.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one member favored or could accept an unchanged\npolicy stance. This policy position took account of current indications of a generally acceptable rate of economic growth and the\nabsence of any clear signs regarding the future strength of the\nexpansion in relation to the economy's potential or the future course\nof inflation. Several commented that current monetary policy might be\nviewed as somewhat restrictive, though the degree of restraint was\ndifficult to calibrate and it did not appear as yet to be inhibiting\ndeclines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, increases in\nstock prices, or the availability of financing from lending\ninstitutions.\n\nMembers expressed somewhat differing views regarding the\nstance of monetary policy that was likely to prove consistent with the\nCommittee's objectives over time. In the view of some, private\nspending was not likely to have sufficient momentum to overcome the\neffects of increased fiscal restraint if the current stance of\nmonetary policy were maintained. In the circumstances, an easing at\nsome point would be needed to foster sustained economic growth at an\nacceptable pace and would be consistent with progress toward the\nSystem's price stability objective. For most of these members,\nhowever, the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy in the\nthird quarter had reduced the urgency of such a policy move and had\ncreated enough uncertainties to justify a careful appraisal of\nunfolding developments before a decision was made to ease policy. In\nthe view of one member, the probability of a shortfall from an\nacceptable rate of economic expansion was sufficiently high to require\nan immediate easing of policy. Other members believed that an\nunchanged policy was desirable under current conditions and that the\ndirection and timing of the next policy move was more open to\nquestion. Not only were recent data giving an uncertain picture of\nthe underlying strength of aggregate demand, but current forecasts\ngenerally did not point to progress toward the System's long-run goal\nof price stability. In this view, therefore, the current stance of\nmonetary policy, even if slightly restrictive, was likely to be\nconsistent with satisfactory economic growth over time and it would\nprovide better assurance of consolidating gains against inflation and\nfostering some further moderation in price increases over coming\nyears. With regard to potential fiscal policy developments, although\nan especially broad range of outcomes seemed possible, the members\nagreed that the Committee could not freeze its policy options while it\nawaited the outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate nor could it\ncommit itself to a specific response to a particular fiscal policy\nagreement. Fiscal policy and any associated market reactions would be\namong the many factors that would have to be taken into account in the\nformulation of monetary policy.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting\nadjustments to monetary policy, a majority of the members expressed a\npreference for retaining a symmetric directive. In their view, the\npotential need to adjust policy during the relatively short intermeeting period was remote and some of these members also believed that the\ndirection of the next adjustment to policy was uncertain. A few also\nnoted that the adoption of a biased intermeeting instruction at this\npoint might send an unintended message regarding the prevailing view\nwithin the Committee concerning the risks to the expansion. The\nremaining members said that they preferred a directive that was tilted\ntoward an easing policy action. Such an instruction in the directive\nwould be consistent with what they viewed as the most likely policy\ncourse over coming months. They agreed, however, that the current\nuncertainties surrounding the economic outlook were not likely to be\nresolved during the weeks immediately ahead and since no policy action\nwas likely to be required in this period, they could accept a\nsymmetric directive.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they could vote for a directive that\ncalled for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that did not include a presumption about the likely\ndirection of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\na moderation in the expansion of economic activity\nafter a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm\npayroll employment increased further in October and the\ncivilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent.\nIndustrial production fell somewhat in October after a\nmoderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal\nretail sales were little changed on balance over\nSeptember and October. Single-family housing starts\nwere up considerably in the third quarter. Orders for\nnondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion\nof spending on business equipment in the near term;\nnonresidential construction has risen appreciably\nfurther. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods\nand services narrowed over July and August from its\naverage rate in the second quarter. After increasing\nat elevated rates in the early part of the year,\nconsumer and producer prices have risen more slowly on\naverage in recent months.\n\nShort-term market interest rates have changed\nlittle on balance since the Committee meeting on\nSeptember 26 while long-term rates have fallen\nsomewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies has declined slightly over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nIn October, M2 was unchanged and M3 growth\nmoderated. For the year through October, M2 expanded\nat a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and\nM3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Growth in\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in\nrecent months but for the year to date remains around\nthe midpoint of its monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established\non January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5\npercent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also\nretained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear that it had set for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range\nfor M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to\ntake account of changing intermediation patterns. For\n1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis\nthe same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary\naggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of\nthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Melzer,\nMs. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action : Mr. Lindsey.\n\nMr. Lindsey dissented because he believed that monetary\npolicy should be eased. The evidence suggested to him that in the\nabsence of an easing move the underlying rate of nominal GDP growth\nwas likely to be lower than needed to maintain real GDP at or near its\npotential. The intermediate forecast was subject to a number of\nsignificant risks: household balance sheets seemed unlikely to sustain\nthe current rate of durables expenditure for any extended period;\ngovernment expenditures were certain to be cut substantially; and with\nfiscal contractions underway in Europe and Canada and severe financial\nstresses present in Japan and Mexico, he did not see much likelihood\nof a substantial expansion of exports. In keeping with his views, the\nfinancial markets were signalling the likelihood that a weaker pace of\nnominal GDP growth would materialize. The yield curve was virtually\nflat, with government securities up through relatively long maturities\ntrading at yields below the current average federal funds rate. Thus,\nmarkets would be unlikely to find some easing inappropriate and over\nthe intermediate horizon would view the current level of short-term\nrates as unsustainable.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, December 19, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:35 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
