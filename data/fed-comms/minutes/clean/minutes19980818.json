There were no open market operations in foreign\ncurrencies for the System's account during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period July 1,\n1998, through August 17, 1998. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\ndomestic final demand continued to expand at a robust pace. However,\nincreases in consumer spending and business investment seemed to be\nmoderating somewhat after very large gains earlier in the year, and\ninventory investment had slowed markedly. Net exports remained weak\nas a result of the persisting turmoil in Asian economies. The strike\nat General Motors had damped overall economic activity temporarily,\nbut total payroll employment continued to trend upward, and labor\nmarkets remained extremely tight. Despite the pressures on labor\nresources, trends in wages and prices had remained stable in recent\nmonths.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment expanded further in July even\nthough manufacturing payrolls plunged in association with the General\nMotors strike; job growth remained strong in most non-manufacturing\nsectors. Construction employment continued to increase at about the\nbrisk pace recorded over the first half of the year, and hiring in\nretail trade surged. The expansion of jobs in the services industry\nslowed considerably in July, but this partly reflected a decline in\ntemporary help jobs related to the GM strike. The civilian\nunemployment rate was unchanged in July at 4.5 percent.\n\nIndustrial production declined considerably in June and July.\nAbstracting from the effects of the GM strike, manufacturing output\nfell slightly over the June-July period after having recorded moderate\ngains on average in earlier months of the year; production of business\nequipment expanded briskly in June and July, while the output of\nconsumer goods and materials weakened. The rate of utilization of\nmanufacturing capacity was down appreciably in June and July, mostly\nreflecting the effects of the GM strike.\n\nTotal nominal retail sales fell in July after having risen at\na rapid pace in the first half of the year. A sharp contraction in\nspending for motor vehicles, reflecting the termination at midyear of\nsales incentives offered by the Big Three automakers and shrinking\ninventories at GM dealers, more than accounted for the drop in July.\nNon-auto-related outlays continued on a robust upward trend, with\ngains evident in all major categories. Sales increases were\nparticularly large at furniture and appliance stores and apparel\noutlets. In the housing sector, both demand and construction activity\nremained strong. Starts of single-family units edged down in May but\nrebounded in June. Sales of new homes were at an all-time high in\nJune, and sales of existing homes were only a little below the record\nlevel reached in March of this year. With sales robust, the inventory\nof unsold new homes remained low.\n\nGrowth of business fixed investment slowed in the second\nquarter as the pace of business spending for durable equipment\nmoderated considerably from the exceptionally strong rate of earlier\nin the year. Nonetheless, outlays for computer and communications\nequipment continued to expand rapidly in the second quarter, and\npurchases of other capital goods rose briskly. Available information\nsuggested that growth in business spending on capital goods likely\nwould slow further in the months ahead. In contrast to the strength\nin equipment spending, expenditures on nonresidential building\ndeclined further in the second quarter, and available indicators\npointed to a mixed outlook for this sector in coming months.\n\nBusiness inventory investment slowed sharply in the second\nquarter, owing in substantial measure to a runoff of motor vehicle\ninventories at the wholesale and retail levels. In manufacturing,\nstockbuilding slowed somewhat in the second quarter, and the stock-\nshipments ratio at the end of the quarter remained close to the low\nlevel that had prevailed over the past year. Wholesale inventories\nchanged little on balance in the second quarter as a sizable decline\nin motor vehicle stocks offset a buildup of non-auto durable goods; in\nJune, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector was at the\nupper end of its narrow range for the past year. At the retail level,\na drop in inventories of motor vehicles in the second quarter more\nthan offset a small increase in stocks at non-auto retailers, and the\naggregate inventory-sales ratio in June was a little below the lower\nend of its range for the past year.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially further in the second quarter; the value of\nexports of goods and services declined for a second straight quarter,\nwhile the value of imports continued to rise, though at a somewhat\nreduced pace. Much of the decline in exports in the second quarter\nwas in capital goods, but there also were noticeable decreases in most\nother major trade categories. The increase in imports was\nconcentrated in imported consumer goods, aircraft, and steel.\nEconomic activity in most of the major foreign industrial countries\ncontinued to expand, though at a slower rate, in the second quarter.\nIn Japan, however, economic activity appeared to have contracted\nsharply further in the second quarter. In most other Asian economies,\ncurrencies and equity prices were under downward pressure, and in\nRussia, asset values plummeted in often disorderly markets. Risk\nspreads on dollar-denominated debt widened substantially, not only in\nRussia but for Latin American issuers as well.\n\nPrice and wage inflation had remained relatively stable in\nrecent months. Both the overall CPI and the CPI excluding food and\nenergy items rose slightly on balance in June and July; a small rise\nin food prices offset a noticeable decline in energy prices over the\ntwo-month period. For the twelve months ended in July, the core CPI\nregistered a slightly smaller increase than it had in the year-earlier\nperiod, partly reflecting lower prices for new motor vehicles.\nProducer prices of finished goods changed little on balance in June\nand July; a sizable drop in the prices of energy products over the\nJune-July period more than offset a modest rise in core producer\nprices. For the year ended in July, core producer prices rose\nsomewhat more than in the year-earlier period, reflecting larger\nincreases in the prices of finished consumer goods. Hourly\ncompensation of private industry workers rose in the second quarter at\nabout the average rate for the previous two quarters. For the year\nended in June, however, hourly compensation picked up significantly\nfrom the year-earlier period; the acceleration in compensation was\nevident in wages and salaries and in benefits.\n\nAt its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1998, the Committee adopted\na directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to\naverage around 5-1/2 percent. With the balance of risks still\npointing to the possibility of rising inflation over time, the\nCommittee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a\npossible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds\nrate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the\nmonths ahead.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the period\nsince the meeting on June 30-July 1 toward maintaining the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate\naveraged a little above the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most\nother interest rates fell slightly on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod in response to market assessments that worsening conditions in\nAsia, Latin America, and Russia portended slower growth in U.S. output\nand inflation over an extended period ahead. Declines in Treasury\nyields also reflected a continuing flight toward safety and quality\nfrom the persisting turbulence in foreign markets. In an atmosphere\nof increasing concerns about the prospects for corporate earnings,\nshare prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile and major\nindexes declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar rose somewhat further over the intermeeting period in relation\nto other major currencies. The dollar changed little against the\ncontinental European currencies but it moved up strongly against the\nJapanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar. The\ndollar's rise in terms of the yen reflected spreading pessimism\nregarding the Japanese government's ability to redress the problems of\nits troubled banking system and provide fiscal stimulus adequate to\nturn its economy around. The dollar's advance against the Canadian\ndollar occurred in the context of continuing weakness in global\ncommodity prices that was weighing down that currency. The dollar\nalso appreciated slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of\nthe developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important\ntrading partners of the United States.\n\nAfter having expanded briskly in the second quarter, M2\ngrew at a somewhat more moderate rate in July, and M3 changed little.\nThe deceleration in M2 reflected reduced inflows to retail money\nmarket funds. The halt in the growth of M3 was associated with a\nsharp runoff of large time deposits and outflows from institution-only\nmoney market funds triggered by a temporary spike in interest rates on\nmarket instruments around quarter-end. For the year through July,\nboth aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for\nthe year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to\nhave moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup earlier in the\nyear.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that\neconomic activity would expand through 1999 at a pace somewhat below\nthe estimated growth of the economy's potential. Reduced growth of\nforeign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable\nearlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were\nanticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S.\nexports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic\nproducts. Moreover, additional moderation in business inventory\ninvestment would damp domestic production as inventory accumulation\nwas brought into better balance with the forecast of a more moderate\ntrajectory of final sales. The staff analysis suggested that the\nprospective gains in income coupled with the earlier run-up in\nhousehold wealth would support further brisk, though gradually\ndiminishing, gains in consumer spending. Housing demand was expected\nto remain relatively strong in the context of the persisting favorable\ncash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income\ngrowth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding\nsomewhat. Growth in business fixed investment would gradually\nmoderate from the vigorous pace of the first half of the year in\nresponse to smaller increases in business sales and profits.\nPressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the\nexpansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was expected to\npick up gradually as a result of an anticipated reversal of some of\nthe decline in energy prices this year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members focused on the disparate forces that\ncontinued to shape trends in economic activity, notably the persist-\nence of considerable strength in private domestic spending and the\ndamping influences stemming from foreign economic developments. The\nlatter seemed likely to be larger than previously anticipated as\nfinancial turmoil in some foreign economies had deepened and spread\nand currently showed few signs of stabilizing. Moreover, equity\nprices and risk spreads in U.S. financial markets were beginning to be\nadversely affected, potentially slowing domestic demand. The members\ngenerally anticipated somewhat more moderate growth than they had in\ntheir previous forecasts, with prospective expansion at a pace near or\nsomewhat below the growth of economy's potential. Nonetheless, they\nremained concerned about the potential for higher inflation, given the\nwidespread tightness in labor markets and an upward tilt in the rise\nof labor compensation. For the present, however, inflation remained\nsubdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in\nlight of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the\ntendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price\nincreases.\n\nAmong the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic\neconomic activity, the members viewed the external sector as a major\nsource of uncertainty. The continued rapid decline in net exports\nduring the first half of the year largely seemed to reflect the\nfurther financial unsettlement and a deeper contraction in Asian\neconomies than had been anticipated earlier, and several members\ncommented that they saw little evidence that financial and economic\nconditions in Asia were stabilizing. Indeed, such conditions appeared\nto be worsening further in some Asian nations, and other countries had\nbeen affected by the associated weakening in the demand for\ncommodities and the more risk-averse attitudes of investors.\nAnecdotal reports at this meeting suggested that the impact on the\ndomestic economy was being felt by manufacturing firms in several\nindustries, although some firms also reported that declining exports\nto Asia were being offset at least in part by rising exports to other\nareas of the world. Looking ahead, the members agreed that the\nduration and extent of disruptions in Asian and other economies could\nnot be anticipated with any degree of confidence; while net exports\nwere not expected to decline as rapidly as they had in the first half\nof the year, even more serious disruptions in Asia could not be ruled\nout and would have important implications for the U.S. economy.\n\nIn their review of developments in key expenditure sectors of\nthe domestic economy, members observed that over the first half of the\nyear the strength in domestic final demand, notably in the consumer\nand business investment sectors, had more than offset the negative\neffects of developments in the foreign sector and other factors. In\nthe consumer sector, the outlook for further sizable increases in\nspending was buttressed by unusually favorable underlying factors,\nincluding solid ongoing gains in employment and incomes and\nsubstantial further increases in household net worth this year. A\npause in the robust gains in retail sales in early summer was\naccounted for in part by limited inventories of new motor vehicles\nassociated with the now-settled GM strike. While a variety of factors\npointed to sustained growth in consumer spending, a less ebullient\nstock market, should it persist, would foster more moderate expansion\nin consumer spending, perhaps at a pace more in line with the rise in\nconsumer incomes, or at an even slower pace if consumer confidence\nwere adversely affected by developments in financial markets.\n\nBusiness fixed investment also seemed to be on a solid upward\ntrajectory, though some slowing in the growth of business investment\nspending was anticipated in response to a projected deceleration in\noverall business output and weaker business profits. Members\ncontinued to cite anecdotal evidence of very strong construction\nactivity in many parts of the country, including indications that\nbuilding projects were being delayed because of shortages of labor and\nsome construction materials. In other parts of the country, building\nactivity remained at a high level but seemed to have moderated\nsomewhat. Business spending for various types of high-tech equipment\nhad surged to an undoubtedly unsustainable pace in the first half of\nthe year. Against this background, several members referred to\nemerging signs of slightly more cautious attitudes among their\nbusiness contacts, in many cases the result of concerns about\ndevelopments in Asia. On balance, diminishing momentum in business\ninvestment appeared to be a likely prospect, but the ample\navailability of financing on favorable terms would continue to support\nthis sector.\n\nIn the housing sector, construction activity remained at a\nhigh level in most parts of the nation and, as was the case for\nconstruction activity more generally, homebuilding continued to be\nrestrained in a number of areas by limits on the availability of labor\nand other inputs. The housing market clearly was benefiting from\nstrong gains in household incomes, high levels of household wealth,\nand very attractive financing costs. There were few indications of\nany moderation in this sector of the economy. Even so, some slowing\nwas anticipated, at least after current construction backlogs were\nsatisfied, in response to the projected slowing in employment growth\nand the high level of the housing stock.\n\nCurrently available data indicated that the pace of inventory\naccumulation had moderated substantially in the second quarter.\nNonetheless, the rate of non-auto inventory investment in the spring\nstill appeared to have exceeded a pace that was consistent with\nsustainable growth in sales. Anecdotal reports at this meeting\npointed to a somewhat mixed picture with regard to desired inventory\nlevels, including examples of both overstocking and shortages.\nLooking ahead and apart from short-run fluctuations, inventories were\nnot expected to add to demand over coming quarters, at least after the\nrestocking of motor vehicles by General Motors was completed.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the outlook for wages and\nprices, members commented that the rate of inflation in consumer\nprices was difficult to characterize with precision because alterna-\ntive price indexes provided different measurement results; in\nparticular, chain price indexes for consumption expenditures showed\nsubstantially less inflation than the CPI. Even so, it was clear on\nthe basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more\ngenerally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight\nlabor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation. And whatever\nthe explanation, it seemed that the economy had been less prone to\nrising inflation than it had been historically under similarly tight\nlabor market conditions. The members acknowledged that a number of\nspecial factors were contributing to the relatively benign inflation\nclimate. Those factors included the appreciation of the dollar;\ndeclines in many commodity prices, notably that of oil; ample\nindustrial capacity; and evidently diminished inflation expectations.\nMoreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of\nrising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in\nnumerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or\nimpossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising\ncosts or enhance profit margins. Against this backdrop, members\nremained persuaded that a significant rise in price inflation was not\nlikely to occur in the nearer term.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, the members generally agreed\nthat rising price inflation remained an important threat. Significant\nadditional tightening in labor markets would, of course, exacerbate\nthat risk, but even at current levels these markets were tight and at\nsome point labor costs could increase more rapidly, pressing on\nprices. Moreover, the effects of some of the factors holding down\ninflation seemed likely to wane, and possibly to reverse, over time.\nThe latter included the effects of the dollar's appreciation on the\nprices of imports and competing domestic products, a possible upturn\nin energy prices and perhaps other commodity prices as foreign\neconomies stabilized, and faster increases in the costs of worker\nbenefits, notably those related to health care. The apparently\ngreater willingness of labor unions to press for higher wages and\nother benefits in very tight labor markets might also intensify upward\npressures on labor costs. On balance, while the risks of an overheat-\ning economy and rising price inflation might have faded to some\ndegree, many of the members continued to emphasize that the Committee\ncould not ignore those risks in its policy formulation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one of the members agreed on the desirability of\nmaintaining a steady policy stance. The overall performance of the\neconomy remained highly satisfactory. While inflation risks were\nstill a concern, given the high level of output and strong domestic\ndemand, the uncertainties bearing on the economic outlook remained\nsubstantial, and indeed the risks on the downside seemed to have\nincreased appreciably further. On balance, domestic economic and\nfinancial conditions had not changed sufficiently during the inter-\nmeeting period to warrant an adjustment to policy. With regard to the\ncurrent uncertainties in the economic outlook, members emphasized that\nthe extent and ultimate effects of the apparently spreading fragility\nin foreign financial markets and economies on U.S. financial and\neconomic conditions were unknown. In these circumstances, nearly all\nthe members believed that a cautious wait-and-see approach to policy\nseemed appropriate to allow the Committee time to assess the course of\nevents and the interplay of the divergent forces bearing on the\nperformance of the economy. In this regard it was noted that while\ndomestic financial conditions remained generally accommodative, recent\ndevelopments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets had\ntended on balance to decrease some of the stimulative effects of\nfinancial conditions on aggregate demand in the United States by\nshifting demand overseas, increasing somewhat the cost of raising\ncapital, and reducing the financial wealth of households. However, a\nfew members expressed concern about the potentially inflationary\nimplications of relatively rapid growth in key monetary aggregates\nover the past year, though such growth appeared to have moderated\nrecently. And in the view of one of these members, the trend in\nmonetary growth along with indications of rising speculative\nimbalances and excesses in various markets for financial and\nnonfinancial assets called for a prompt firming of monetary policy.\n\nWhile overall economic conditions had not changed enough in\nrecent weeks to warrant an adjustment in policy, a majority of the\nmembers agreed that the risks to the economic outlook were now more\nbalanced and called for a shift from asymmetry to symmetry in the\nCommittee's directive. Such a directive would better represent their\nview that the Committee's next policy move could be in either\ndirection depending on developments abroad and their interaction\nwith a domestic economy that had remained quite strong. Greater\ndifficulties abroad and associated downward pressures on demand and\nprices had substantially diminished the chances of a strengthening of\ninflation pressures over coming months and quarters that would require\na near-term tightening of policy. Other members continued to believe\nthat the risks were still tilted to some degree toward rising\ninflation, though to a lesser extent than earlier. Labor market\ndevelopments continued to suggest that the economy could well be\nproducing beyond its sustainable potential and concrete signs that\ninflation pressures would abate had yet to emerge. Accordingly, they\nstill preferred an asymmetrical directive but could accept symmetry in\nlight of the prevailing uncertainties in the economic outlook and the\nexpectation, shared by the other members, that policy would not need\nto be changed during the intermeeting period ahead.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members were in favor of retaining a directive that called for\nmaintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an\nunchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. Most also\nindicated that they could support a shift to a directive that did not\ninclude a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to\npolicy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost interest rates have fallen slightly on balance\nsince the meeting on June 30-July 1. Share prices in\nU.S. equity markets have remained volatile and major\nindexes have declined appreciably on balance over the\nintermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the\ntrade-weighted value of the dollar rose somewhat further\nover the intermeeting period in relation to other major\ncurrencies; in addition, it was up slightly in terms of\nan index of the currencies of the developing countries of\nLatin America and Asia that are important trading\npartners of the United States.\n\nAfter robust growth in the second quarter, M2\ndecelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.\nFor the year through July, both aggregates rose at rates\nwell above the Committee's ranges for the year.\nExpansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to\nhave moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup\nearlier in the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting\non June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2\nto 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was\nmaintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the\nCommittee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same\nranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth\nquarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-\nation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower\nfederal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter-\nmeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley,\nMeyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.\n\nMr. Jordan.\n\nMr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the underlying\nstrength of aggregate demand in the U.S. economy would remain\nfundamentally intact, despite economic problems abroad. The problems\nin Asia provide a channel for economic imbalances to develop. Exports\nfrom some U.S. manufacturing industries will decline due to softer\nforeign markets and import competition. At the same time, domestic\ndemand for imports, housing, and consumer durables will increase due\nto favorable interest rate trends. Though U.S. production of goods\nand services might slow during the period ahead, it is not yet clear\nthat total demand will diminish at a comparable pace. At the same\ntime, ample credit provision encourages speculative lending and\nexcessive consumption. Consequently, continued rapid growth in the\nmoney supply creates the risk that inflation will accelerate and\neconomic imbalances will become protracted.\n\nOn September 21 the Committee held a telephone conference to\ndiscuss recent developments in domestic and international financial\nmarkets and their implications for the U.S. economy. The consultation\nwas held as background for Chairman Greenspan's testimony on\nSeptember 23 before the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, September 29, 1998.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m."
