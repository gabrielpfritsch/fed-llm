There were no open\nmarket transactions in foreign currencies for System account during\nthe period since the meeting on August 20, 1996, and thus no vote was\nrequired of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in U.S.\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nAugust 20, 1996, through September 23, 1996. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nexpansion of economic activity had moderated appreciably from an\nelevated second-quarter pace. Growth in consumer spending had slowed\nnoticeably, and higher mortgage rates seemed to be exerting some\nmodest restraint on housing demand. While business demand for durable\nequipment remained strong, spending on nonresidential structures had\nweakened a little. Business inventory accumulation appeared to have\npicked up, although the level of inventories remained modest in\nrelation to sales. Employment and production had continued to post\nsizable gains in recent months, but the increases were somewhat below\nthose recorded earlier in the year. Consumer price inflation,\nexcluding its food and energy components, had edged lower this year\ndespite somewhat larger increases in labor compensation.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over\nJuly and August than it had in the second quarter; aggregate hours\nworked by private production workers also expanded at a slower pace\nover the two-month period. Job growth in the services industries was\nsomewhat lower over the two months compared with that of the second\nquarter. Manufacturing employment changed little on balance over the\nJuly-August period, and construction hiring was down considerably in\nAugust after a July increase that was a little above the pace of the\nsecond quarter. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.1\npercent in August.\n\nIndustrial production also advanced somewhat less rapidly on\naverage in July and August after having recorded strong gains in the\nprevious few months; slower growth was evident in mining and utilities\nas well as in manufacturing. Smaller increases in the output of motor\nvehicles and parts accounted for part of the slowdown in the expansion\nof the manufacturing sector in August; in addition, the output of\nconsumer goods other than motor vehicles remained sluggish, and the\nproduction of construction supplies declined significantly after\nhaving surged in the second quarter. Elsewhere in manufacturing,\nbusiness equipment, notably its office and computing component,\ncontinued its robust expansion over July and August, and defense and\nspace equipment extended the upturn that began in the second quarter.\nThe rate of utilization of total industrial capacity was unchanged on\nbalance from June to August and remained at a relatively high level.\n\nTotal retail sales rose slightly over July and August after\nhaving declined substantially in June. Decreased outlays at food\nstores, gas stations, and furniture and appliance stores in August\nwere a little more than offset by a sharp pickup in sales at general\nmerchandisers, apparel stores, and outlets for durable goods other\nthan furniture and appliances. Housing starts rebounded in August\nfrom a July drop and for the two months were about unchanged on\naverage from their second-quarter level; however, permits for single-\nfamily housing were unchanged in August and had fallen from their\nsecond-quarter level. Sales of existing homes weakened in June and\nJuly.\n\nDemand for business equipment had remained strong in recent\nmonths. Shipments of nondefense capital goods declined in July,\nretracing part of a substantial second-quarter advance, but recent\ndata on new orders pointed to further increases in business spending\nfor durable equipment, notably office and computing equipment, in\ncoming months. Nonresidential construction activity fell somewhat in\nJuly after having decreased a little in the second quarter.\n\nBusiness inventory investment picked up sharply in July; most\nof the increase occurred at retail establishments. Manufacturing\ninventories rose somewhat, with the gain concentrated at manufacturers\nof producers' durable equipment. The stock-sales ratio for the sector\nwas around its historical low. In the wholesale sector, inventories\nedged higher in July despite a substantial drop in stocks of farm\nproducts, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector fell to the low\nend of its range over recent years. Retail stocks expanded\nconsiderably at both automotive dealers and non-auto establishments in\nJuly. Inventory-sales ratios edged higher in most retail categories\nbut they remained at relatively low levels.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in July from its June level and also from its\naverage rate for the second quarter. Despite one-time service\npayments related to the Olympics and larger inflows of imported oil,\nimports edged down in July from the sharply increased rate recorded\nfor the second quarter; the latter largely reflected the strength of\nthe U.S. economy during the first half of the year. Exports fell\nconsiderably more in July than did imports; in addition to decreased\nexports in such categories as consumer goods, aircraft and parts,\nautomotive products, and other industrial supplies, part of the\nmeasured decline may have reflected residual seasonality in the data.\nAvailable information suggested that, on balance, the economies of the\nmajor foreign industrial countries had strengthened in recent months.\nIn Japan, a mild second-quarter pause after very rapid first-quarter\ngrowth had been followed by renewed expansion. Economic activity in\nGermany had rebounded sharply in the second quarter from a first-\nquarter contraction, and further expansion appeared to be in train.\nAlthough economic growth had been sluggish in Canada and the United\nKingdom in the second quarter, recent indicators suggested a pickup in\nactivity in those countries as well. By contrast, France and Italy\nhad experienced little, if any, growth since early in the year.\n\nConsumer price inflation remained moderate on balance over\nJuly and August; declines in energy prices offset higher food prices.\nExcluding food and energy, consumer prices recorded a somewhat smaller\nadvance over the twelve months ended in August than over the previous\ntwelve months. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and\nenergy were unchanged on net over July and August, and this index rose\nat a significantly slower pace over the twelve months ended in August\nthan over the preceding twelve months. Average hourly earnings of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers rebounded in August, more than\noffsetting a small July decline. Over the year ended in August, this\nmeasure of labor costs increased considerably more than it had over\nthe previous year.\n\nAt its meeting on August 20, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nand slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nWith incoming information generally confirming that economic\ngrowth was moderating and that price inflation remained subdued, open\nmarket operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree\nof pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period.\nThe federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected\nwith an unchanged policy stance, but most other market interest rates\nexhibited considerable volatility and rose somewhat on balance over\nthe intermeeting interval. Despite the rise in many market interest\nrates, equity prices rebounded over the period, and most major market\nindexes reached record highs.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated slightly over\nthe intermeeting period. The dollar's rise reflected in part the\nincrease in U.S. long-term interest rates over the period. Declines\nin market rates abroad, both short- and long-term, also contributed to\nthe dollar's strengthening. In Japan, newly released data led market\nparticipants to lower their assessments of the strength of that\ncountry's economic expansion and of the prospects of any near-term\nincrease in official interest rates. In Germany, a reduction by the\nBundesbank in its repo rate in late August and subsequent statements\nby Bank officials regarding possible additional declines in official\nrates appeared to foster market expectations that monetary policy\nmight be eased further.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 picked up in August from sluggish rates\nin July but remained below the average increases over the first half\nof the year. A continuing, rapid runoff in the liquid deposit\ncomponents of these aggregates was offset in part by solid gains in\nretail money market funds and small time deposits, whose yields had\nnot declined in step with decreases in market interest rates in early\nAugust. For the year through August, both aggregates grew at rates in\nthe upper portions of their respective annual ranges. Expansion in\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate on balance over\nrecent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting, which differed\nlittle from that for the previous meeting, suggested that the\nexpansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the\neconomy's estimated growth potential. Expansion of consumer spending\nwas forecast to rebound from the sluggish third-quarter rate in light\nof strong income trends, the favorable effect of the rise in the stock\nmarket this year on household wealth, and the generally ample\navailability of credit. Homebuilding was anticipated to slow somewhat\nin response to this year's increase in residential mortgage rates but\nto remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained\nincome growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home\nownership. The expansion of business investment in equipment and\nstructures was projected to slow gradually in response to an easing of\npressures on capacity, a prospective slackening in the growth of\ncorporate cash flows, and the rise in long-term interest rates that\nhad occurred this year. Only modest fiscal restraint was anticipated\nover the forecast period. Inflation, which had been boosted thus far\nin 1996 by adverse developments in food and energy markets, was\nprojected to remain somewhat above that of recent years, given high\nlevels of resource utilization and a noticeable step-up in labor\ncompensation that would be reinforced by the legislated rise in the\nfederal minimum wage.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the incoming information\nhad been mixed since the August meeting but that on the whole it\ncontinued to suggest appreciable slowing in the economic expansion\nfrom a rapid and unsustainable pace in the second quarter. Data for\nmany components of final demand, notably in the consumer sector,\nindicated that economic growth had moderated considerably in recent\nmonths. At the same time, supply-side data including employment and\nindustrial production had remained relatively robust, contributing to\nuncertainty about underlying growth and suggesting that inventory\naccumulation had picked up during the summer. While the extent of the\nslowing in the overall expansion remained unclear, there were no\nindications of serious imbalances in the economy, and the members\ngenerally viewed further growth at a pace near that of the economy's\npotential as a likely prospect. They continued to be concerned,\nhowever, about the outlook for inflation, given the high level of\nproduction. In that regard, some commented that labor markets\nappeared to have tightened further in recent months and that wages\nwere rising at a somewhat faster pace. Even so, the rate of price\ninflation had not picked up and the prospects were good that inflation\nwould remain contained for some time. Whether the factors that had\ncontributed to such a price performance would persist remained a key\nuncertainty in the economic outlook, and the members generally agreed\nthat the risks continued to be tilted to some extent in the direction\nof rising price inflation over the forecast horizon.\n\nIn their discussion of the outlook for spending in key\nsectors of the economy, members commented that consumer expenditures\nwere likely to pick up after their summer lull, though probably to a\npace appreciably below that in the first half of this year. Favorable\nfactors in the outlook for consumer spending included strong gains in\nemployment and income, the wealth effect stemming from the rise that\nhad occurred in the value of financial assets, and generally buoyant\nconsumer sentiment. The improvement in the consumer sector would tend\nto be restrained, however, by the increase in consumer debt burdens\nand the probable satisfaction of much of the pent-up demands for\nconsumer durables during the current expansion. Business fixed\ninvestment likewise was expected to provide considerable further\nstimulus to the economy. Expenditures for business equipment, notably\nfor office and computing equipment, were expected to expand\nsubstantially further, and recent weakness in nonresidential\nconstruction might well prove to be temporary, judging in part from\nanecdotal reports of considerable strength in commercial real estate\nmarkets in many areas. On the whole, however, the completion of\nnumerous capital spending programs in conjunction with slower\nprojected growth in overall demand could be expected to temper the\nexpansion of business investment over coming quarters. In the housing\nsector, recent developments were somewhat mixed, but they suggested on\nbalance that housing activity had held up better than expected in the\nlight of increased mortgage interest rates. It was suggested in this\nregard that the retarding effects of higher rates on fixed-rate\nmortgage contracts were being blunted to some extent by shifts toward\nadjustable rate mortgages. Even so, and consistent with the softening\nalready observed in a number of areas, residential construction was\nthought likely to drift lower over time.\n\nThe outlook for inventory investment, as is typically the\ncase, was very difficult to assess. The moderation in the expansion\nof final demand in recent months, together with still relatively\nrobust growth in employment and production, suggested that inventory\ninvestment had picked up since the second quarter. The strength in\ninventories in July tended to confirm that assessment. However,\nassuming moderate economic growth in line with current forecasts,\nthere was no reason to anticipate substantial further strengthening in\ninventory investment over coming quarters. Indeed, the recent\nrebuilding of inventories after little or no growth earlier in the\nyear made rapid expansion less likely going forward. The members\nacknowledged, nonetheless, that inventory developments needed to be\nmonitored with care, including such indirect signs as rising pressures\non the prices of intermediate goods and tightening delivery schedules\nthat might provide incentives for a rapid buildup. With capacity\nutilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in\ninventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than-\nprojected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures\non resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.\n\nIn their comments about the outlook for inflation, members\nobserved that the recent behavior of price inflation was a welcome\nthough highly unusual development, given current pressures on\nresources. The statistical and anecdotal information provided\nevidence of increasingly tight labor markets that under similar\nconditions historically had been associated with considerable upward\npressure on nominal labor compensation and, in turn, on prices. While\nwages, and probably total labor compensation, were rising more rapidly\nthis year, the acceleration in the latter still appeared to be held\ndown by worker insecurity and relatively subdued increases in the cost\nof benefits. Moreover, for a variety of reasons rising labor costs\nwere not currently being passed through to prices, which by several\nkey measures adjusted for their volatile food and energy components\nexhibited a steady or even a declining trend. Explanations tended to\nconcentrate on the intense competition in many markets, which\nprevented firms from raising prices to absorb cost increases.\n\nCompetitive pressures also were compelling firms to curb cost\nincreases through improvements in their productivity performance.\nWidespread reports suggested major gains in productivity in numerous\nindustries, induced in recent years by business restructuring and\nrelated activities and by large capital investments that had\nintroduced increasingly productive equipment. Although currently\navailable measures of productivity for the economy as a whole showed\nonly weak gains, sectoral disaggregation of the data gave reasons to\nquestion the productivity measurements. Productivity had increased\nfairly sharply in manufacturing, and the slowdown in overall\nproductivity since 1973 had been concentrated in the service areas of\nthe economy. Indeed, measured productivity in noncorporate\nbusinesses--largely services--had displayed a negative trend for many\nyears. This result was implausible and suggested considerable error\nin estimating output and prices for many services. Consequently, it\nwas likely that actual productivity growth was higher than the current\nmeasures indicated. By the same token, the rate of price inflation\nwas lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a\nnumber of studies of distortions in published price data.\n\nThe implications for the inflation outlook were not clear-\ncut. The key question was how long the favorable price behavior would\npersist. Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and\nhigh margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of\nany cost increases for a time. However, many business contacts\nindicated that they would resist squeezes in profit margins, and\ncontinued acceleration in costs would eventually feed through to\ngreater price inflation whatever the rate of productivity growth. The\nbehavior of costs and the ability of businesses to pass along any\ngreater increases over time would depend on the extent to which the\nexpansion would slow and how much associated pressure there would be\nin labor and product markets. In this connection, some members\nobserved that even if the expansion were to slow to a sustained pace\naround the rate of increase of the economy's potential, price\ninflation could well trend at least modestly higher at current levels\nof resource utilization. Others did not disagree that the odds might\nbe tilted marginally in that direction, but they continued to believe\nthat a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for resource\nuse and, in turn, the relationship between a given degree of pressure\non resources and overall price changes. In sum, assuming economic\ngrowth generally in line with their forecasts, the critical question\nfor some was when and how much inflation would rise; many others were\nnot persuaded of the inevitability of such an outcome.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could support\nan unchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward\nrestraint in the directive. The members generally agreed that while\nthe risks were greater that price inflation would rise than that it\nwould fall, higher inflation was not a foregone conclusion and most\nbelieved that the uncertainties in the outlook made it prudent to hold\nmonetary policy on a steady course and await further developments.\nThe expansion appeared to be slowing substantially and broad measures\nof prices, adjusted for fluctuations in their food and energy\ncomponents, still indicated a steady or even slightly declining\ninflation trend. In these circumstances, the Committee could wait for\nmore information on the momentum of the expansion and the degree of\npressure on resources and its implications for inflation. A delay in\nadjusting monetary policy was facilitated by its current positioning,\nwhich did not appear to be far from a desirable longer-term stance\nbecause any pickup in inflation was likely to be relatively small and\ngradual, and was further supported by the possibility of an excessive\nreaction in financial markets to a change in the direction of policy.\nA few members indicated that they could vote for some slight\ntightening in policy, although they did not feel any urgency about\nsuch a move. They observed that the decision was a close one for\nthem, and in light of the uncertainties that were involved, they were\nwilling to join the majority and wait for further evidence bearing on\nthe outlook for inflation. With regard to possible intermeeting\nadjustments to policy, the members agreed that retaining an asymmetric\ndirective that was biased toward restraint would be consistent with\ntheir assessments of the inflation risks in the economy. Accordingly,\ninformation suggesting that the odds on higher inflation had risen\nshould be met with a prompt policy firming.\n\nA differing view focused on the desirability of a prompt move\ntoward restraint to curb what were seen as growing inflationary\npressures in the economy. Tight labor markets were likely to exert\ncontinuing upward pressure on labor costs, barring unexpected\nweakness in the economy, and at some point those costs would begin to\nbe passed through to prices. In the circumstances, it was important\nfor policy to be forward-looking and to move promptly to head off\nintensifying inflationary pressures. Potentially, waiting could\nrequire more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk\nthe credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they could accept a directive that\ncalled for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of\nreserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have risen somewhat on\nbalance since the Committee meeting on August 20, 1996.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has\nappreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 picked up in August, but they\ncontinued to expand at rates below those in the first\nhalf of the year. For the year through August, both\naggregates are estimated to have grown at rates in the\nupper portions of their respective ranges for the year.\nExpansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been\nmoderate on balance over recent months and has remained\nin the middle portion of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee\nagreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in\n1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth\nquarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMcTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Stern.\n\nMr. Stern dissented because he believed that a modestly more\nrestrictive policy was appropriate. In his view, historical\nprecedents suggested that prolonged periods of taut labor markets were\neventually associated with rising inflation. Given prevailing\npressures on resources, especially labor, Mr. Stern was concerned\nabout the distinct risk of an acceleration of inflation. Should this\nacceleration occur, he believed it would prove disruptive to the\nfavorable performance of the economy, and he preferred to begin to\naddress this risk promptly.\n\nAmendment to Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations\n\nAt this meeting the Committee considered a proposal to\nreplace the existing 12-month maturity limit on the investment of\nforeign currency balances with an 18-month average duration limit.\nThe proposal was designed to allow the Manager a wider choice of\nmaturities and hence somewhat greater operational flexibility in the\nimplementation of the System's primary portfolio objectives of\nliquidity with respect to investments in foreign government securities\nand limits on overall interest rate and credit risks. At the\nconclusion of their review, the Committee members voted unanimously to\namend section 5 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations\nto read as follows:\n\nLiquidity Management and the Maturity Structure of the SOMA Portfolio\n\nThe Committee also reviewed, on a preliminary basis, its\ncurrent practices with regard to the maturity structure of the System\nOpen Market Account (SOMA) portfolio of Treasury obligations. In its\nlast such review, at its meeting on March 31, 1992, the Committee\ndecided that the enhanced liquidity of the SOMA portfolio that had\nbeen achieved should be maintained but that net additions to System\nholdings should continue to be spread across all maturity areas. In\nthe course of their discussion at this meeting, the members agreed\nthat the primary objective in the management of the SOMA portfolio was\nto ensure a high degree of liquidity so that prompt and effective\nadjustments could be made without unduly affecting the market for\nTreasury securities.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held\non Wednesday, November 13, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:40 p.m.\n\nAttended portion of meeting relating to proposal to amend the\nAuthorization for Foreign Currency Operations."
