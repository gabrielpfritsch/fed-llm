There were no open\nmarket operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in\nthe period since the previous meeting, and thus no vote was required\nof the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period September\n29, 1998, through November 16, 1998. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager informed the Committee that he planned to initiate\noutright purchases in the secondary market of inflation-indexed\nTreasury securities. In the past, the System had been acquiring\nholdings of such securities in Treasury auctions in exchange for\nmaturing nominal obligations. In the Manager's opinion, secondary\nmarket transactions would provide a helpful addition to the current\nrange of assets that the System normally purchased, especially in a\nperiod of little or no increase in Treasury debt. Some members\nexpressed concern that sizable purchases of indexed securities by the\ncentral bank might impair the liquidity of the market and limit the\nusefulness of these obligations as indicators of inflationary\nexpectations. It was noted, however, that relatively limited System\npurchases of such securities were contemplated so that the market was\nnot likely to be significantly affected. Moreover, the System's\nparticipation could contribute to a more active and liquid secondary\nmarket.\n\nIn further discussion of the wording of the operating\nparagraph of its directive, the Committee at this meeting focused on\nproposals by members to simplify and clarify the sentence relating to\nthe symmetry or asymmetry of the directive as it applied to possible\nfuture policy changes. Time constraints did not permit the Committee\nto complete its deliberations, and it agreed to continue its\ndiscussion at a later meeting.\n\nThe Committee then turned to the economic and financial\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. Committee decisions to amend the\nAuthorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and to renew certain\nswap line agreements also are summarized below.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested some\nmoderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace\nduring the summer months. Although growth of economic activity in the\nthird quarter apparently about matched the pace in the first half of\nthe year, a large buildup of nonfarm inventories had accounted for a\nsignificant portion of the persisting strength of the expansion during\nthe quarter. Growth in consumer spending had been well maintained\nduring the summer months, and housing activity had remained at a high\nlevel. In other major sectors of the economy, business fixed\ninvestment had softened after having surged in the first half, and net\nexports had declined further, although at a reduced pace. Growth in\nemployment had slowed appreciably on balance during the summer and\nearly fall months, but tight conditions had persisted in most labor\nmarkets. Recent wage and price developments had been mixed.\n\nGrowth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in\nSeptember and October. The slowing partly reflected sizable job\nlosses in manufacturing, which has been substantially affected since\nearlier in the year by increasing foreign competition stemming from\nthe crisis in Asia. Outside of manufacturing, increases in employment\nin the service-producing industries moderated somewhat over the two\nmonths, although gains in finance, insurance, and real estate were\nrelatively robust. The civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2\npercent during the two months.\n\nIndustrial output had declined slightly in recent months\nafter having rebounded in August when production resumed at General\nMotors following settlement of the labor strike. Outside the motor\nvehicle sector, manufacturing output edged lower in recent months\nafter having decelerated markedly earlier in the year. Weakness in\nthe manufacturing and mining sectors was associated in large measure\nwith the fallout from the turmoil in Asia, its repercussions on a\nnumber of U.S. trading partners, and the related softness in world oil\nmarkets. The downward trend in the utilization of capacity in\nmanufacturing left the factory operating rate appreciably below its\nlevel of late last year.\n\nPersonal consumption expenditures rose considerably further\nduring the third quarter, though at a much slower pace than that\nrecorded earlier in the year. Retail sales were down slightly on\nbalance during the quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in sales of motor\nvehicles associated with the work stoppage at General Motors.\nHowever, the settlement of that strike and the resumption of\nproduction led to an upturn in overall motor vehicle sales in August\nand a sizable advance in September. A large further gain in such\nsales contributed to a sharp rise in overall retail sales in October.\nConsumer confidence retreated further in October, but according to a\nmajor survey it turned up in early November, albeit to a level still\nsomewhat below its peak earlier in the year.\n\nAvailable indicators pointed to a pickup in business capital\nspending after a third quarter lull, owing to some extent to a\nrecovery from the General Motors strike. Business investment\nexpenditures during the summer were held down in part by the strike-\nrelated decline in fleet sales of new motor vehicles. In addition,\nspending for other types of business equipment grew somewhat more\nslowly in the third quarter after having expanded at an extraordinary\npace earlier in the year. Orders received by U.S. equipment makers\ncontinued to trend up through September. In contrast, nonresidential\nbuilding activity apparently fell somewhat further in the third\nquarter. While the construction of lodging facilities surged and the\nconstruction of office space persisted at a high level, there was a\ndecline in other commercial building, which includes retail stores and\nwarehouses, industrial structures, and institutional buildings. The\navailability of financing for various types of construction appeared\nto lessen substantially in late summer, and financing costs rose for\nmany borrowers.\n\nIn the residential sector, housing sales and starts remained\nquite strong, though below early summer highs. Housing activity\nshowed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part\nof the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an\nupturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing,\nincluding a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.\nMultifamily housing starts increased considerably in the third\nquarter, but since late summer the availability of financing for\nmultifamily building projects has tended to diminish and interest\ncosts to rise.\n\nBusiness inventory accumulation was sizable in the third\nquarter, and stocks-sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some\nindustries that were being adversely affected by the nation's growing\ntrade deficit. In manufacturing, however, stockbuilding slowed during\nthe summer months and the stock-shipment ratio was unchanged at a\nlevel just above its average for the past year. At the wholesale\nlevel, a rapid increase during the third quarter lifted the inventory-\nsales ratio for this sector to its highest level since 1986; nearly\nhalf the rise was the result of a buildup of farm products that was\nrelated in part to an early harvest, but wholesalers of machinery,\nchemicals, and metals and minerals also apparently experienced\nundesired buildups of stocks. Retail inventories excluding motor\nvehicles accumulated at a slow pace during the summer, and the\ninventory-sales ratio for this category remained well within the\nnarrow range of the past year.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened to some extent in July-August from its second-quarter average.\nThe value of imports in the July-August period, though rising\nappreciably in August, was somewhat below the second-quarter average,\nwith most of the decline involving automotive products and oil. The\nvalue of exports fell somewhat over the two months, largely reflecting\ndeclines in exports of automotive products and industrial supplies and\nreduced service transactions. Decreases in exports partly reflected\nweakness in foreign economies. In the third quarter, growth in\neconomic activity slowed on average in the major industrial countries,\nother than Japan, from the average pace in the first half of the year\nand contracted for a fourth consecutive quarter in Japan. There were\nwidespread indications in the industrial nations, particularly from\nsurveys of business and consumer confidence, that some slowing was\npersisting into the fourth quarter. Elsewhere, the available evidence\npointed to some improvement in economic trends in a number of Asian\nnations, but the economies of several sizable South American countries\nappeared to have weakened. Recent economic indicators for Mexico were\nmixed.\n\nThe performance of various measures of wages and prices was\nuneven in recent months. The most recently available employment cost\nindex indicated that hourly compensation of private industry workers\nposted a sizable increase in the third quarter. However, gains in\naverage hourly earnings moderated considerably in September and\nOctober. The increase in the employment cost index over the past year\nwas appreciably larger than in the previous year while the advance in\naverage hourly earnings moderated somewhat.\n\nConsumer energy prices rose appreciably in October, but they\nwere still down sharply from a year earlier and on balance limited the\nincrease of overall consumer prices over the past year. Core consumer\nprices moved up at a faster pace than overall consumer prices in\nrecent months and over the past year, reflecting sizable increases in\nthe prices of tobacco, used cars and trucks, and services. At the\nproducer level, prices of finished goods edged up in recent months but\nwere down on balance over the past year; excluding food and energy\nitems, producer prices rose somewhat over the past year.\n\nAt its meeting on September 29, 1998, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets\nthat were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in\nthe federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent. The\nCommittee also decided to adopt an asymmetric directive that was\ntilted toward ease to highlight its view that the risks to the\neconomic expansion were mainly on the downside and to underscore its\nreadiness to respond promptly to developments that threatened the\nsustainability of the expansion. The reserve conditions associated\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with some\nmoderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over subsequent months.\n\nFollowing the meeting, open market operations were directed\ninitially toward implementing a slight easing in the degree of\npressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate, responding to\nquarter-end pressures and uncertainties created by shifting funding\npatterns in volatile financial markets, tended at first to average\nsomewhat above the intended rate of 5-1/4 percent despite a relatively\nliberal provision of reserves by the System. Strains in financial\nmarkets continued to mount, with intermediaries and final investors\nmuch more cautious about risks and leverage and much more eager to\nhold very liquid assets. These developments in turn disrupted flows\nof funds in a number of financial markets. On October 15, the\nCommittee discussed these developments and their implications for the\ndomestic economy, and the members supported the Chairman's suggestion\nthat, in keeping with the directive issued at the September 29\nmeeting, he instruct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to reduce\nthe intended federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points to around\n5 percent. On the same day, the Board of Governors approved a\nreduction in the discount rate from 5 percent to 4-3/4 percent. These\nactions were taken in the light of growing indications of caution by\nlenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally\nthat were deemed likely to restrain aggregate demand in the future.\nSubsequently, trading in the federal funds market remained relatively\nvolatile but the federal funds rate averaged close to its lower\nintended level. In financial markets more generally, strains\ngradually moderated after mid-October and sizable issuance of\nsecurities resumed in a number of key markets, but uncertainty\nremained high and relatively illiquid conditions persisted. In the\nstock market, share prices dropped in the weeks following the\nSeptember meeting, but the market rallied strongly after mid-October\nand key market indexes posted sizable gains on balance over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar fell moderately over the period in relation to other major\ncurrencies. The largest decline occurred in relation to the Japanese\nyen and appeared to reflect efforts to reduce speculative exposure to\nthat currency; changes in the value of the dollar against other major\ncurrencies were mixed, likely fostered by disparate interest rate and\neconomic developments. The dollar also fell somewhat in terms of a\nbroad index of currencies of other countries that are important\ntrading partners of the United States, including the developing\nnations of Latin America and Asia.\n\nM2 and M3 posted very large increases in September and\nOctober. The gains appeared to be induced to an important extent by\nincreased demand for safe and liquid assets in a period of substantial\nturmoil in financial markets that led to shifts of funds by households\nout of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt. The\nadvance in M2 during October probably also was boosted by the decline\nin its opportunity cost resulting from the effects of the System's\neasing actions on market interest rates and the unusual softness in\nTreasury bill rates during much of the month. The even faster\nincrease in M3 in October also reflected both inflows to institution-\nonly money market mutual funds that were stimulated by declines in\nshort-term market rates and bank efforts to fund heavy demand for\nloans arising in part from the deflection of demand for funding from\nsecurities markets. For the year through October, both aggregates\nrose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year.\nExpansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt moderated slightly in\nrecent months after picking up earlier in the year.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to\npoint to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity\nto a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's\npotential, but the expansion was expected to pick up later to a rate\nmore in line with that potential. Subdued expansion of foreign\neconomic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place\nconsiderable, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S.\nexports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of\nimports for domestic products. Domestic production also would be held\nback for a time by the efforts of firms to bring inventories into\nbetter balance with the anticipated moderation in the trajectory of\nfinal sales. In addition, private final demand would be restrained a\nbit by the tighter terms and conditions that were now imposed by many\ntypes of lenders and by the anticipated waning of positive wealth\neffects stemming from earlier increases in equity prices. Pressures\non labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of\neconomic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise\nconsiderably over the year ahead in association with a partial\nreversal of the decline in energy prices this year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members observed that indications of some\nmoderation in the pace of the economic expansion were still quite\nlimited, but they generally agreed that the economy appeared to be\nheaded toward slower growth. Relatively tight profit margins and less\nebullient growth in wealth were among the factors expected to be\ndamping investment and consumption. In addition, even apart from the\npossibility of further financial contagion in Latin America, the\nweakness in foreign economies continued to be seen as a persistent\nsource of restraint on demand in a number of domestic sectors, notably\nmanufacturing, agriculture, and some extractive businesses. Although\nthe financial markets had improved substantially in recent weeks,\noverall credit conditions were still relatively unsettled and a\npossible reintensification of difficulties in credit markets\nconstituted an important downside risk to the expansion. The members\nrecognized that not all the risks were in one direction, however. The\neconomy had demonstrated remarkable resilience and strength over\nrecent years, and in the view of some members the rapid growth of\nliquidity and bank credit suggested that financial conditions were not\nexcessively tight. With regard to the outlook for inflation, members\nnoted that while statistical and anecdotal information pointed to\npersistently tight labor markets in much of the nation, price\ninflation remained subdued. Indeed, even though the recent evidence\nrelating to prices was somewhat mixed, several broad measures of\nprices suggested that inflation might be on a declining trend.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, the members gave\nconsiderable attention to recent financial developments and their\nimplications for the economic outlook. Financial markets clearly had\ncalmed markedly since the System's easing actions in mid-October,\nthough they were still atypically volatile. Risk spreads had narrowed\nsubstantially and other measures of financial market performance also\nsuggested that risk aversion and the related desire for liquidity had\ndiminished appreciably. Markets for new issues had reopened for many\nborrowers, and stock market prices had posted large gains.\nNonetheless, strains and weaknesses in financial markets had not\ndisappeared--many risk spreads were still at unusually high levels--\nand the markets remained quite sensitive to unanticipated\ndevelopments. Members also noted that the improvement in debt markets\nappeared to have come to a halt most recently and indeed that renewed\nstrains had emerged in some short-term debt markets, though the latter\nprobably were related in large measure to concerns about year-end\npressures in the money markets. Indeed, efforts by lenders and\nborrowers to position for year-end financial statements were likely to\ncontribute considerably to keeping market conditions unsettled over\ncoming weeks. Lending activity at banks had increased sharply in\nrecent months as many borrowers found other sources of funds less\nreceptive or unavailable and turned to backup lines for credit, but\nbanks also had tightened their credit terms and standards for most new\nloans and lines of credit. As a result, financing generally had\nbecome less available and more expensive for higher-risk business\nborrowers. In light of these developments, members believed that the\ncontinuing fragility of financial markets and the increased scrutiny\nof the credit quality of borrowers, though the latter was in some\nrespects a welcome development, posed a considerable downside risk to\nthe expansion. The very recent behavior of equity prices was\ndifficult to explain satisfactorily, and potential movements in those\nprices posed risks on both sides of the most likely forecast: A\nfuture substantial increase would bolster wealth and spending, but a\nsharp decline also could not be ruled out--especially if, as seemed\nquite possible, added increases in prices were not supported by robust\nincreases in profits.\n\nForeign economic and financial developments were another\nimportant source of downside risk and uncertainty. The economic and\nfinancial turmoil in Asia had spread to numerous other nations around\nthe world and to an extent to the United States. While economic\nweakness in many U.S. trading partners likely would continue to have\nadverse effects on net U.S. exports, the potential extent of such\nweakness was subject to considerable uncertainty as were the\nassociated repercussions on financial markets. As they had at\nprevious meetings, members referred to numerous anecdotal reports of\nheightened competition from foreign producers that was curbing the\nsales of many domestic manufacturers, notably in the steel industry,\nand in some other industries and agriculture. Moreover, the low level\nof world oil prices, which appeared to be importantly associated with\ndiminished demand from Asian countries, was retarding production and\nreducing revenues in the U.S. energy and related industries. On the\npositive side, members commented that economic and financial\nconditions appeared to have stabilized or improved a bit in a number\nof Asian nations, though the recession in Japan showed little evidence\nof coming to an end, and the outlook for Brazil seemed a little more\npromising. However, economic and financial conditions in Brazil and a\nnumber of other countries remained very fragile. The recent\ndepreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure\non prices, would damp the deterioration in net U.S. exports.\n\nIn their review of recent and prospective developments across\nthe nation and in key sectors of the economy, members referred to\nscattered indications of some slowing in private domestic final\ndemands. In the important consumer sector, however, evidence of\nweakening growth in expenditures was quite limited. The most recent\nanecdotal reports pointed to solid growth in most though not all\nregions of the country, and retail sales posted a strong advance in\nOctober. Moreover, consumer sentiment remained at a high level,\nalbeit below its peak earlier in the year according to a recent\nsurvey. Members commented, however, that the more moderate growth in\nemployment and incomes experienced recently likely would persist and\nshould result in reduced gains in consumer expenditures next year, but\nthey also noted that the extent of the deceleration was subject to\nconsiderable uncertainty. Some members referred to reports from\ncontacts in the retailing industry who expressed some concern about\nthe potential for weaker retail sales after the holiday season. A\nsignificant factor bearing on consumer spending would be the\nperformance of the stock market. The impetus from the wealth effects\nof rapidly rising share prices would wane if such prices were to\nstabilize near current levels.\n\nWith regard to business fixed investment, anecdotal evidence\nwas accumulating that many business firms, notably in manufacturing,\nwere scaling back their planned capital outlays for the year ahead.\nFactors contributing to the prospective deceleration in business\ncapital expenditures included a weaker trend in profits over the past\nseveral quarters, a related deterioration in business cash flows, and\na large buildup in capacity over the course of recent years. Members\nalso referred to indications of curtailed availability and more costly\nfinancing for some businesses, notably for relatively speculative\nconstruction projects. A number of members observed that the latter\nwas a healthy development in that it would tend to hold down\noverbuilding in some areas. Overall, capital expenditures would\nundoubtedly recover from their slight decline during the summer\nmonths, but the outlook was for growth next year at a pace well below\nthat experienced for an extended period before mid-1998. Housing\nconstruction was expected to remain at a high level, buttressed by\nattractive terms on new home mortgages, but housing activity appeared\nto have peaked or declined slightly in some regions.\n\nThe rapid buildup in inventories during the third quarter was\nnot likely to continue, but the timing and extent of the expected\nmoderation were largely unpredictable. It was noted in this regard\nthat while inventories appeared to have risen to uncomfortable levels\nin some industries, there was no evidence of a general inventory\noverhang. Looking ahead, the projected slowing in the growth of final\nsales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would\nreinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories\ninto better alignment with that of their sales, and such a development\nshould contribute to the projected slowing in overall economic\nactivity in coming quarters. It was unclear at this point to what\nextent year 2000 concerns might stimulate extra inventory investment\nprior to the end of 1999.\n\nIn their review of developments bearing on the outlook for\ninflation, members commented that labor markets remained exceptionally\ntight, though there was little evidence that they had tightened\nfurther in recent weeks. Employers were continuing to resist\npressures to grant unusually large wage increases, and the persistence\nof vigorous competition, including that from Asian imports, was\npreventing most business firms from passing cost increases through to\nprices. Indeed, the declining trend in profits in recent quarters\nsuggested that many firms were absorbing some of their rising labor\ncosts to the extent that the latter were not offset by improvements in\nproductivity. Looking ahead, slower growth in economic activity would\ntend to hold down pressures on wages and prices during 1999 and\nimports from Asian and other depressed economies would continue to\ngenerate intense competition in many markets; but labor markets\nremained tight, energy and commodity prices could well turn up after\nsubstantial declines, and the recent depreciation of the dollar would\nlessen pressures from foreign competition. A number of members\nexpected that, on balance, inflation might be less favorable next\nyear, though any deterioration in underlying trends should be\nrelatively limited; others anticipated little change in and possibly\nsome further ebbing of price inflation, extending the subdued behavior\nof a number of comprehensive measures of prices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could accept\na proposal to reduce the federal funds rate by a further 25 basis\npoints to an average of 4-3/4 percent. This policy decision was\nviewed as a close call by several members. While the growth of the\neconomy was expected to slow appreciably over the year ahead, the\nexpansion currently displayed only modest signs of moderating from\nwhat seemed to be an unsustainable pace. Moreover, many members saw\nsome risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong\nfurther advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on\nthe basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a\nrelatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later. The members\nwere more concerned, however, about the risks stemming from the still\nsensitive state of financial markets, and in that regard many believed\nthat a prompt policy easing would help to ensure against a resurgence\nof severe financial strains. A further easing move would complete the\npolicy adjustment to the changed economic and financial climate that\nhad emerged since midsummer and would provide some insurance against\nany unexpectedly severe weakening of the expansion. Most members saw\nlittle risk that a modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures\nin the economy, given the subdued behavior of inflation and their\noutlook for economic activity. Moreover, the easing could readily be\nreversed if unexpected circumstances should call for such an action.\nIn this view, the risks of inaction were greater in terms of the\npotential financial consequences and also could materialize much\nsooner than the risks of stimulating greater inflation through the\nslight easing that was contemplated.\n\nSome members indicated that in light of continued robust\neconomic growth, tight labor markets, and improving financial\nconditions they had a preference for awaiting further developments\nthat might provide a stronger basis for an easing action. Some of\nthese members expressed concern that easier reserve conditions would\naccommodate a step-up in monetary growth that was already quite rapid,\nwith potentially inflationary consequences later. Nonetheless, all\nbut one of these members could endorse the decision to ease, given the\nevident downside risks in the international situation, financial\nmarket uncertainty, the likelihood that inflation would still be quite\nlow, and the possibility of reversing the action reasonably promptly\nshould circumstances warrant.\n\nGiven its decision to ease policy, the Committee favored a\nchange to symmetry from the asymmetry toward ease in its recent\ndirectives. A symmetrical directive was now felt to be appropriate in\nlight of the Committee's expectation that further easing was not\nlikely to be needed over the months ahead unless ongoing developments\npointed to a more substantial decline in the growth of economic\nactivity or further ebbing of inflation than was currently\nanticipated. The members recognized that the possible emergence of\nsevere year-end pressures in the money market might require some\ntemporary easing in reserve conditions, but such a development did not\nseem to have a high probability and could in any event be readily and\nproperly accommodated regardless of the bias in the directive.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all except\none member supported a directive that called for conditions in reserve\nmarkets that would be consistent with a slight decrease in the federal\nfunds rate to an average of about 4-3/4 percent. These members also\naccepted a proposal to remove the bias toward easing that had been\nadopted at the previous meeting. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a\nslightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds\nrate would be acceptable during the the intermeeting period. A staff\nanalysis prepared for this meeting suggested that the reserve\nconditions contemplated by the Committee were likely to be consistent\nwith some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have risen on balance\nsince the meeting on September 29, though yields on the\nbonds of lower-rated firms have declined. The Board of\nGovernors approved a reduction in the discount rate from\n5 to 4-3/4 percent on October 15. Share prices in U.S.\nand global equity markets have remained volatile but have\nposted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar declined moderately over the period\nin relation to other major currencies; it also fell\nsomewhat in terms of an index of the currencies of other\ncountries that are important trading partners of the\nUnited States.\n\nM2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent\nmonths, reflecting the effects of recent System easing\nactions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by\nhouseholds out of investments in equities and lower-rated\ncorporate debt. For the year through October, both\naggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's\nranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has moderated slightly in recent months\nafter a pickup earlier in the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting\non June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2\nto 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was\nmaintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the\nCommittee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same\nranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth\nquarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with decreasing the federal funds rate to an\naverage of around 4-3/4 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-\nation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower\nfederal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter-\nmeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are\nexpected to be consistent with some moderation in the\ngrowth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley,\nMeyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and Ms. Rivlin.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Jordan.\n\nMr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the two recent\nreductions in the Federal funds rate were sufficient responses to the\nstresses in financial markets that had emerged suddenly in late August.\nAn additional rate reduction risked fueling an unsustainably strong\ngrowth rate of domestic demand. He expressed concern that the\nexcessively rapid rates of growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\nwere inconsistent with continued low inflation. Moreover, any further\nmonetary expansion in response to economic weakness abroad could\nultimately have a disrupting influence on domestic prosperity if policy\nwere forced to reverse course at a later date to defend the purchasing\npower of the dollar.\n\nThe Committee voted unanimously to re-authorize Federal Reserve\nparticipation in the North American Framework Agreement, established in\n1994, and the associated bilateral reciprocal currency (\"swap\")\narrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico. These\narrangements, which predated the North American Framework Agreement,\nwere linked into a trilateral facility in connection with the\nestablishment of the North American Financial Group in 1994 to\nfacilitate consultation and cooperation among the three countries in the\narea of macroeconomic policy as an outgrowth of the increasing\nintegration of those economies expected to result from the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement.\n\nOwing to the formation of the European Central Bank and in\nlight of 15 years of disuse, the bilateral swap arrangements of the\nFederal Reserve with the Austrian National Bank, the National Bank of\nBelgium, the Bank of France, the German Federal Bank, the Bank of Italy\nand the Netherlands Bank were jointly deemed no longer to be necessary\nin view of the well established present-day arrangements for\ninternational monetary cooperation. Accordingly, it was agreed by all\nthe bilateral parties to allow them to lapse. Similarly, it was jointly\nagreed to allow the bilateral swap arrangements between the Federal\nReserve and the National Bank of Denmark, the Bank of England, the Bank\nof Japan, the Bank of Norway, the Bank of Sweden, the Swiss National\nBank, and the Bank for International Settlements to lapse in light of\ntheir disuse and present day arrangements for international monetary\ncooperation.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Manager, the Committee voted\nunanimously to amend the authorization for domestic open market\noperations to extend the maximum maturity of System repurchase\nagreements from 15 calendar days to 60 calendar days. The purpose of\nthe expanded authority was to enhance the flexibility of the Manager in\nmeeting reserve supplying objectives during periods of pronounced\nseasonal needs, notably those associated with the year-end. Subject to\nthe Committee's approval, the Manager would initiate the System's use of\nextended-term repurchase agreements ahead of the coming year-end, and he\nanticipated that such use could prove to be especially advantageous in\nlate 1999 to the extent that year 2000 concerns generated accentuated\nseasonal demand for currency. In addition, the availability of the\nextended funding could help to allay concerns in the federal funds\nmarket about the cost of financing during periods of peak seasonal\npressures, with favorable effects on the market's functioning.\n\nAccordingly, effective November 17, 1998, paragraphs 1(b) and 3\nof the authorization for domestic open market operations were amended to\nread as follows:\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, December 22, 1998.\n\n(b) To buy U.S. Government securities,\nobligations that are direct obligations of, or fully\nguaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of\nthe United States, from dealers for the account of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for\nrepurchase of such securities or obligations in 60\ncalendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise\nexpressly authorized by the Committee, shall be\ndetermined by competitive bidding, after applying\nreasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with\nindividual dealers; provided that in the event Government\nsecurities or agency issues covered by any such agreement\nare not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the\nagreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the\nmarket or transferred to the System Open Market Account.\n\n3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open\nmarket operations, while assisting in the provision of\nshort-term investments for foreign and international\naccounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and\ndirects the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for\nSystem Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government\nsecurities to such foreign and international accounts on\nthe bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements\nproviding for the resale by such accounts of those\nsecurities within 60 calendar days on terms comparable to\nthose available on such transactions in the market; and\n(b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to\nundertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed\non purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b),\nrepurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency\nsecurities, and to arrange corresponding sale and\nrepurchase agreements between its own account and foreign\nand international accounts maintained at the Bank.\nTransactions undertaken with such accounts under the\nprovisions of this paragraph may provide for a service\nfee when appropriate.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:25 p.m."
