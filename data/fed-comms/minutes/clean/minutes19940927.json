Moskow by the boards of directors of the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Chicago as alternate\nmember of the Federal Open Market Committee for the period\nSeptember 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994, and that he had\nexecuted his oath of office.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on August 16, 1994, were approved.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee elected Frederic S. Mishkin\nas Associate Economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to\nserve until the next election at the first meeting of the Committee\nafter December 31, 1994, with the understanding that in the event of\nhis discontinuance of his official connection with the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York he would cease to have any official connection with\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets during the period since the August\nmeeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod August 16, 1994, through September 26, 1994. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\npace of economic expansion remained substantial, though it appeared to\nhave moderated slightly in recent months. Final sales, especially of\nconsumer goods, had firmed during the summer months while inventory\ninvestment apparently had slowed after a second-quarter surge.\nManufacturing activity, bolstered by a pickup in production of motor\nvehicles, had been rising briskly, and the trend of payroll hiring\nremained strong. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer\nprices had been somewhat larger in recent months, and prices of\nmaterials had remained under considerable upward pressure.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in\nAugust, though at a somewhat less rapid rate than the average pace in\nearlier months of the year. The slowdown in hiring in August was\nconcentrated in retail trade, where employment was little changed\nafter large gains in the two prior months, and in construction, where\nit fell slightly. In manufacturing, employment was up considerably\nafter essentially no change in July; while much of the strength was\nrelated to a pickup in the production of motor vehicles, hiring was up\nin a number of other industries as well. The average workweek of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers declined in August from July's\nrelatively high level, but for the two months combined the average\nhours worked was well above the second-quarter level. Both household\nemployment and the labor force surged in August, and the civilian\nunemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent.\n\nIndustrial production rose sharply in August after sizable\ngains in previous months. The August advance reflected a large increase in manufacturing output that was partly offset by declines in\nmining production and electricity generation; much of the strength in\nmanufacturing resulted from a large rise in the output of motor\nvehicles stemming from unusually rapid retooling for the new model\nyear. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production of office and computing\nequipment continued to expand briskly, and output of industrial\nequipment was up significantly. Total utilization of industrial\ncapacity rose further in August from already high levels.\n\nConsumer spending remained on a solid upward trend. Retail\nsales rose considerably in August after holding steady in July. Sales\nof goods other than motor vehicles registered sizable increases in\nboth July and August. Sales of motor vehicles, which had been\nconstrained in recent months by shortages of popular domestic models,\nrebounded in August. Housing starts in July and August averaged\nslightly less than their second-quarter rate. Single-family starts\nhad leveled off in recent months after declining earlier in the year;\nmultifamily starts, though erratic from month to month, had been\ndrifting higher.\n\nThe limited data available for the third quarter suggested\nthat growth of real business fixed investment, though still strong,\ncontinued to slow from the very rapid pace of 1993. Shipments of\nnondefense capital goods declined in July, offsetting much of a large\nJune advance. However, orders for nondefense capital goods were up\nsignificantly on balance in June and July, pointing to continued brisk\nexpansion in business spending on durable equipment. Nonresidential\nconstruction activity increased further in July, and permits for such\nconstruction remained on a mild uptrend.\n\nThe growth in business inventories slowed markedly in July\nafter surging in the second quarter. The July deceleration reflected\na sizable reduction in retail inventories, principally automotive and\ngeneral merchandise stocks. For the retail sector as a whole, the\ninventory-to-sales ratio declined sharply in July to about the middle\nof the range seen in recent years. At the wholesale level,\ninventories increased substantially, both in July and over the second\nquarter, and the overall inventory-to-sales ratio edged up in July\ntoward the middle of the range for this ratio in recent years.\nInventory investment also picked up in manufacturing, where much of\nthe July accumulation represented stocks of materials, supplies, and\nwork-in-progress. The run-up in stocks was accompanied by a drop in\nfactory shipments, and as a result, the inventory-shipments ratio\nrecorded an unusually steep rise.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially further in July after a large increase in the\nsecond quarter. The value of exports of goods and services slipped in\nJuly from a relatively high level in June, while the value of imports\nin July changed little from June. Economic activity in all of the\nforeign G-7 industrial countries except Japan expanded rapidly in the\nsecond quarter, and available indicators suggested that strong growth\ncontinued on average in the third quarter. In Japan, activity\ncontracted in the second quarter, reflecting weakness in consumption\nand business investment; the limited data available for the third\nquarter suggested that growth in that country might have resumed.\n\nConsumer prices rose a little faster in July and August than\ntheir average pace for the first half of the year. The recent pickup\nin consumer inflation reflected large increases in energy prices as\nwell as somewhat higher food prices; excluding the food and energy\ncomponents, consumer price advances had remained moderate. Prices\nrose briskly at the producer level in July and August as prices of\nfinished energy goods surged and prices of finished foods turned up\nafter declining over the first half of the year. For items other than\nfinished foods and energy, the increase over the July-August period\nwas a little faster than in the first half of the year. Recent data\nindicated little change in wage trends. Average hourly earnings of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers rose in August at about the rate\nobserved over the previous twelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on August 16, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure\non reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise in the\ndiscount rate. The Committee did not include in the directive any\npresumption about further adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nmodest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nImmediately after the conclusion of the August meeting, the\nBoard of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the\ndiscount rate to a level of 4 percent. The Committee permitted the\nfull amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in the\nmarket for reserves, and the federal funds rate rose about 1/2\npercentage point to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. As indicated\nin an announcement released on the day of the meeting, the Committee\ndid not anticipate that further policy tightening was likely to be\nneeded for a time, given the substantial nature of the policy move.\nAccordingly, open market operations over the intermeeting period were\nconducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of\npressure on reserve positions implemented just after the August\nmeeting, and the federal funds rate remained near 4-3/4 percent. In\naccordance with the usual cresting of seasonal demands for discount\ncredit at this time of the year, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing\nrose over much of the period but began to edge lower subsequently.\nBorrowing averaged near anticipated levels.\n\nMost market interest rates were up somewhat on balance since\nthe August meeting. Short-term rates, which had risen prior to the\nmeeting in anticipation of a smaller policy move, increased modestly\nfurther after the Federal Reserve tightened and then changed little\nover the next several weeks. Subsequently, however, these rates began\nto move higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as\npointing to the potential for greater inflation in the future and\nhence to further firming in reserve conditions. Long-term yields fell\nfollowing the policy tightening, but these declines were erased within\na few days, and rates later rose noticeably further in response to the\nincoming data. Most major indexes of equity prices were up on balance\nover the intermeeting period despite price declines near the end of\nthe period.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period.\nBearish sentiment toward the dollar in the foreign exchange markets\nappeared to be influenced importantly by continuing concerns about\ninflation trends in the United States compared with those in other\nmajor industrial countries.\n\nM2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in\nJuly, and data available for September pointed to little further\nchange in either aggregate. The August decline in M2 reflected\nweakness in most of its liquid components that may have been induced\nto a considerable extent by the rise, which began early this year, in\nthe opportunity costs of holding such accounts. The decline in M3 was\nassociated with a sharp drop in institution-only money funds in\nresponse to the increase in market yields, but the weakness in this\nbroader aggregate was limited by the brisk issuance of large-denomination time deposits as banks continued to rely on managed\nliabilities to fund credit growth. For the year through August, M2\nand M3 grew at rates slightly above the lower ends of their respective\nranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand\nat a moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth in economic activity would slow appreciably over the next\nseveral quarters, dropping briefly below the rate of increase in the\neconomy's potential output. According to a staff analysis, the\neconomy already was operating at its long-run capacity, and the\nforecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any\ncontinuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that\ncould foster sustained higher inflation. Growth in consumer\nexpenditures was projected to moderate next year as spending on\nconsumer durables lost some momentum in the context of diminishing\npent-up demands, the rise in borrowing costs, and smaller gains in\nincome. After an extended period of very rapid increases, growth in\nbusiness fixed investment also was expected to slow appreciably,\npartly reflecting less favorable financial conditions and partly the\nslower pace of output growth. Homebuilding would be damped by higher\nfinancing costs, though activity in this sector was expected to remain\nwell above the depressed levels reached in recent years. With the\neconomy operating close to its long-run potential, no further\nreduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated over the\nforecast horizon. Consumer price inflation was projected to be\nelevated over the near term--by some pass-through of the ongoing run-up in materials prices and by higher import prices--before settling\ndown again.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members commented on continuing indications of a\nrobust expansion in business activity, with output near maximum\nsustainable levels. They still viewed significant slowing in the pace\nof the expansion as a reasonable expectation, though they acknowledged\nthat signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular\nthat the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat\nmore strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing\nduring the late spring and early summer. The policy tightening\nactions implemented earlier in the year seemed to have elicited only a\nmild response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.\nHowever, much of the retarding effects of those actions, including the\nrecent sizable tightening in August, probably had not yet been felt in\nthe economy. In light of the strength of aggregate demand and lags in\nthe effects of policy, the risks of some rise in inflation rates\nprobably had increased. How large this rise might be or when it might\nbe reversed was very difficult to predict at this point. However,\nindications of a persisting pickup in inflation would be a matter of\nconsiderable concern, and further developments would need to be\nmonitored with special care in light of the Committee's longstanding\ncommitment to containing inflation and moving over time toward price\nstability to foster the maximum, sustainable performance of the\neconomy.\n\nIn their review of developments across the nation, members\ncommented on high levels of business activity in many regions and\nmany of them referred to increasing reports of scarcities of specific\ntypes of labor resources. After softening earlier in many areas,\nbusiness conditions appeared to have strengthened in a number of\nregions during recent weeks while displaying little change or\ncontinued moderate growth elsewhere. Robust expansion in\nmanufacturing activity, especially in the motor vehicle and related\nindustries, was a notable feature of recent business developments. On\nthe financial side, the overall expansion of credit had remained\nmoderate, but many members stressed the ready availability of\nfinancing from increasingly aggressive bank lenders. Moreover,\ndespite higher interest rates, capital markets were providing\ncontinued support to a wide variety of borrowers. The constraints on\nthe availability of credit and the reluctance of many borrowers to\nincur new debt, factors that had tended to retard the recovery during\nits earlier stages, had given way to a financial climate that might\neven be providing an extra impetus to spending.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for activity in key sectors of the\neconomy, consumer spending had been more buoyant than expected over\nrecent months and members saw such spending as likely to be reasonably\nwell maintained. Some moderation in its growth over the quarters\nahead seemed likely, however, as pent-up demands increasingly were\nsatisfied and housing-related purchases of consumer durables tended to\nmoderate. Members cited anecdotal evidence of fairly brisk retail\nsales in many areas recently and associated optimism among retail\nbusiness contacts. Recent survey results indicated that consumer\nsentiment remained favorable. Sales of motor vehicles were expected\nto continue the improvement noted in August as supply shortages were\nmet through increased production.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was viewed as likely to rise\nsubstantially further over the next several quarters, but the rate of\ngrowth had been moderating this year and probably would diminish\nfurther in conjunction with the projected slowing in overall demand.\nThe expansion in expenditures for business equipment had slowed\nconsiderably this year from an extremely rapid rate in 1993 and could\nbe expected to moderate somewhat further. At the same time,\nnonresidential construction was slowly trending higher as firms facing\ncapacity constraints sought to expand their production facilities.\n\nThe prospects for inventory investment remained a key\nuncertainty in the outlook in that developments in this sector could\nwell have an important bearing on the extent of the anticipated\nslowing in the expansion of overall economic activity over the next\nfew quarters. The surge in inventory investment in the second quarter\nclearly was unsustainable, but some members questioned whether the\nexpected cutback in inventory accumulation would be sizable over the\nnear term. Continuing strength in new orders and anecdotal reports\ndid not point to a desire to reduce inventories and suggested that\nmuch of the second-quarter buildup probably had been intended.\nIndeed, in the context of increasing backlogs and lagging deliveries\nthat pointed to growing capacity constraints, many business firms\nmight seek to build \"safety stocks\" to avoid supply disruptions that\nwould interfere with production schedules. At the same time, the\ntrend toward \"just in time\" inventory management--even if temporarily\narrested as safety stocks were increased--would help to limit a\npotentially excessive buildup in inventories that would present a\nthreat later to the sustainability of the expansion.\n\nMembers cited anecdotal evidence tending to support\nstatistical indications of some weakening in housing markets and they\ngenerally anticipated that the rise that had occurred in mortgage\ninterest rates would exert a further damping effect on housing\nactivity over the year ahead. However, against the background of the\nstill relatively favorable affordability of housing and the likelihood\nof some further pent-up demand, only a moderate drop in overall\nhomebuilding activity seemed likely.\n\nA number of members expressed the view that the external\nsector was likely to contribute to the expansion of domestic economic\nactivity in light of the depreciation in the value of the dollar and\nindications of stronger economic growth in foreign industrial nations.\nHowever, relatively rapid expansion in foreign economic activity would\nadd to pressures on world commodity prices at least for a time. One\nmember expressed concern about the potential, albeit uncertain,\neffects on the exchange value of the dollar of developments unrelated\nto the conduct of monetary policy, such as the ongoing trade\nnegotiations with Japan and forthcoming elections in Germany.\n\nIn their discussion of various factors bearing on the outlook\nfor inflation, members noted that some measures of inflation had\npicked up recently and that many private forecasters anticipated\nhigher inflation in 1995 than in 1994. The worsening of inflation\ncould perhaps be viewed as reflecting increasing capacity constraints\nin the face of recent growth in overall demand at a pace above the\neconomy's long-run potential. From this perspective, the future path\nof inflation would depend importantly on the extent to which the\nexpansion in overall activity would in fact abate from an\nunsustainable pace. Some members expressed particular concern that if\nabove-trend growth did not moderate soon, existing inflationary\npressures and inflationary expectations would quickly become more\npronounced and inflation would gather momentum. Thus far, however,\nprice pressures remained concentrated in the early stages of\nproduction. As evidenced by broad measures of prices and anecdotal\ninformation obtained from numerous business contacts, the pass-through\nof the higher costs of materials to the prices of final goods had been\nmuted in what business executives continued to describe as highly\ncompetitive markets. The ability of business firms to hold down price\nincreases in turn reflected to a marked degree their successful\nefforts to control unit costs through ongoing gains in productivity.\nMoreover, with profit margins currently at high levels, business firms\nfacing competitive market conditions had some leeway to absorb rising\ncosts. Increasingly tight labor markets in many parts of the country\nhad not resulted in higher overall wage inflation, but members\nreported some upward pressure on the wages of certain categories of\nworkers in strong demand. One member expressed the view that\ncontinued moderation in price and wage increases also might reflect in\nsome measure a shift in price and wage-setting behavior attributable\nto the credibility of the Committee's anti-inflationary stance in\nrecent years. A number of members commented that the sluggish to\nmoderate growth of a wide variety of money and credit measures\nprovided some assurance that, to date, monetary policy had not laid\nthe basis for a sustained upturn in inflation. Nonetheless, the\nmembers concluded that the potential for additional inflation remained\nsubstantial and, from a monetary policy standpoint, rendered\nespecially urgent the ongoing assessment of inflation trends.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the period ahead,\nmost of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining a steady\npolicy course, at least for the near term. In light of the\nappreciable tightening of policy approved in August, the members had\nanticipated that no further policy change was likely to be required\nfor a period, and at this juncture they generally continued to feel\nthat the recent evidence did not warrant an immediate further\ntightening. Even so, the ongoing inflow of information on the\nperformance of the economy continued to indicate a significant\npotential for higher inflation down the road, and for many members\nthis suggested that additional monetary restraint could well be needed\nat some time. A key uncertainty in this regard related to the\nrestraining effects of the policy moves implemented earlier this year;\nthese actions appeared to have exerted less restraint to date than had\nbeen anticipated, but appreciable lagged effects from those actions--indeed, perhaps a large part of those effects--could still be\nexpected. At this time, it was extremely difficult to evaluate\nwhether the earlier tightening moves were exerting a lesser effect\nthan usual or it simply was more delayed, or whether the members might\nhave misjudged the underlying strength of the expansion. In the view\nof many members, the information that would become available during\nthe intermeeting period should provide a firmer basis for judging the\ncourse of the economy and the risks of greater inflation. Should\nincoming information point to a greater likelihood that price\npressures would intensify, the Committee would need to act promptly\nand forcefully to avert an upward ratcheting of inflationary\nexpectations and actual inflation that would be difficult to reverse.\nConsequently, while views differed with regard to the likely need for\nsome policy tightening over the weeks immediately ahead, the members\ngenerally supported a shift from the symmetry in the August directive\nto asymmetry toward restraint. Some members indicated that they could\naccept an asymmetric directive, but they expressed misgivings about\nthe use of such an instruction in the directive because they felt it\nwas subject to misunderstanding in financial markets and could add to\nuncertainty about Committee intentions. One member favored an\nimmediate move to somewhat greater reserve restraint because the\navailable evidence in his view already suggested an upturn in\ninflationary expectations and the prospect of a significant rise in\ninflation.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of\nmembers commented that the behavior of the monetary and credit\naggregates should be taken into account in the evaluation of the\ncurrent stance of monetary policy. While various money and related\nmeasures had for many years proved unreliable to a greater or lesser\nextent in gauging economic prospects, the weak growth in a wide array\nof these measures could not be entirely disregarded as a possible\nindicator of the degree of monetary restraint and argued for caution\nin implementing any further policy tightening. One member noted,\nhowever, that the slow growth in the narrow measures of reserves and\nmoney followed an extended period of rapid expansion and their recent\nweakness might not be indicative of constrained liquidity at this\npoint. Moreover, the ready availability of bank credit and the\nreceptivity of financial markets more generally argued that many\nborrowers, including small and medium-size businesses, currently had\naccess to ample financing.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they could support a directive that\ncalled for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of\nreserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the\nbroader monetary aggregates over the balance of the year.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the pace of economic expansion, though perhaps\nmoderating slightly in recent months, remains substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, and the civilian unemployment\nrate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. Reflecting strength\nin motor vehicles, industrial production rose sharply in\nAugust after posting sizable gains in other recent\nmonths, and capacity utilization moved up further from\nalready high levels. Retail sales were up considerably\nin August, boosted by a rebound in sales of durable\ngoods, including motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in\nAugust but were unchanged from their second-quarter\nlevel. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a\ncontinued strong expansion in spending on business\nequipment; permits for nonresidential construction\nremain on a mild uptrend. Inventory accumulation\nappears to have moderated recently after surging in the\nsecond quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in\ngoods and services widened in July from its second-quarter average. Prices of materials have remained\nunder upward pressure, and increases in broad indexes of\nconsumer and producer prices have been somewhat larger\nin recent months.\n\nOn August 16, 1994, the Board of Governors approved\nan increase in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 4\npercent, and the Committee agreed that this increase\nwould be allowed to show through completely to interest\nrates in reserve markets. Most market interest rates\nare up somewhat on balance since the August meeting.\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the\nother G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nM2 and M3 declined in August after expanding\nmoderately in July; for the year through August, M2 and\nM3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their\nranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has\ncontinued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price\nstability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent\nand 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.\nThe Committee anticipated that developments contributing\nto unusual velocity increases could persist during the\nyear and that money growth within these ranges would be\nconsistent with its broad policy objectives. The\nmonitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for\nthe year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative\nranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5\npercent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee\nprovisionally set the associated monitoring range for\ngrowth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent\nfor 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will\ncontinue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward\nprice level stability, movements in their velocities,\nand developments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the\nbalance of the year.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,\nLaWare, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a prompt move\nto somewhat greater monetary restraint was needed at this point. In\nhis view, the current stance of monetary policy was overly\naccommodative in light of the signs of increasing price pressures and\nrising inflationary expectations that were associated with the\ncontinuing strength of the economic expansion and high levels of\ncapacity utilization. In this situation, a delay in implementing some\nmonetary policy tightening would incur a substantial risk of a further\nincrease in inflationary expectations and could make it more costly to\nachieve the Committee's longer-term anti-inflationary goals.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, November 15, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
