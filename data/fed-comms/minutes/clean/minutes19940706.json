Guentner and Sniderman, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Cleveland respectively\n\nSecretary's Note: Advice had been received that Alan S.\nBlinder had executed his oath of office as a member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on May 17, 1994, were approved.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets and on System open market transactions in\nforeign currencies during the period May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994.\n\nThe Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley,\nLaWare, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Jordan and\nLindsey.\n\nMessrs. Jordan and Lindsey dissented from this action,\nalthough they agreed that the foreign exchange transactions conducted\nduring the intermeeting period were authorized under the Committee's\nrules. Their dissents were based on their strong reservations about\nthe efficacy of sterilized intervention in most circumstances,\nincluding those prevailing during the intermeeting period. In their\nview, to the extent that repeated intervention failed to achieve\nstated or perceived objectives, questions would tend to arise about\nthe credibility of monetary policy more generally.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second\nquarter. Although consumer spending and homebuying apparently had\nincreased at a slower pace, business spending on durable equipment\nremained quite strong and investment in nonresidential structures\nrebounded from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. In\naddition, the rate of nonfarm inventory investment evidently had\npicked up in the second quarter. Levels of resource utilization had\nrisen further: factory operating rates were at relatively high levels,\nand the slack in labor markets had narrowed considerably over the\nfirst half of the year to what appeared to be very low levels.\nIncreases in consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in\nrecent months, but prices of many basic industrial materials had\nrisen.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment advanced somewhat less rapidly in\nMay after the brisk increases of recent months; however, the average\nworkweek of production and nonsupervisory workers reached its highest\nlevel since 1987. The reduction in job gains was widespread by\nsector--including business services; finance, insurance, and real\nestate; manufacturing; and construction. Employment in transportation\nrebounded, reflecting the end of a Teamsters strike. The civilian\nunemployment rate, measured on the new basis introduced in January,\ndeclined sharply in May, to 6.0 percent; the decline might have been\noverstated as a result of seasonal adjustment problems, but even after\ncorrecting for these factors, the unemployment rate had fallen sharply\nsince late 1993.\n\nThe rise in industrial production slackened in April and May\nafter strong first-quarter gains. Much of the slowing was the result\nof capacity constraints that prevented normal seasonal increases in\nthe production of motor vehicles. Growth of output of manufactured\ngoods other than motor vehicles and parts was at a slightly less\nrobust pace than in the first quarter but close to the rapid rate seen\nin 1993; business equipment and construction supplies continued to be\nareas of strength. The overall rate of utilization in manufacturing\nstayed at a high level in May, with most major industry groups\noperating at or near capacity. In addition to motor vehicles,\ncapacity constraints were evident in the petroleum products and\nnonelectrical machinery industry groups and in some individual product\nlines in other industries.\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures fell on balance in\nApril and May after a strong advance earlier in the year, but the\nlevel of expenditures for the two months combined was a little above\nthe first-quarter average. The recent slowdown in consumer spending\nin large part reflected reduced outlays for motor vehicles. Spending\nfor durable goods other than motor vehicles increased over April and\nMay at about the first-quarter pace. Outlays for nondurable goods\nwere down on balance in April and May, while spending for services in\nMay more than reversed a small April decline. Housing activity had\nrebounded from weather disruptions early in the year to a pace close\nto the elevated fourth-quarter rate. Single-family starts edged down\nin May after declining substantially in April but were still at a\nrelatively high level. While the cash-flow affordability of home\nownership had fallen since late last year, it remained at favorable\nlevels in comparison with recent years. Multifamily starts in May\nwere at their highest level in more than three years; most of the\npickup occurred in the South, where vacancy rates had declined\nrecently.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and\nparts posted a further solid gain in May, although the upward trend\nappeared to have moderated in recent months. Sales of heavy trucks\nalso were strong in April and May. Shipments of aircraft declined\nsharply in April (latest available data), retracing much of a March\nsurge. Available data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed\nto a continued strong uptrend in business spending on durable\nequipment. Nonresidential construction picked up in April and May\nfrom a weather-depressed slump in the first quarter.\n\nBusiness inventories increased in April, more than reversing\na March runoff; the overall pace of accumulation remained moderate,\nand buildups were largely concentrated in segments of the economy\nwhere market demand was robust. In manufacturing, inventories\nincreased in April and May after a small drawdown in March. The rise\nin stocks was in line with shipments, and the ratio of stocks to\nshipments stayed at a very low level. In April (latest available\ndata), wholesale inventories retraced most of the sizable March\ndrawdown. The ratio of inventories to sales in this sector remained\nbelow the range that has prevailed in recent years. At the retail\nlevel, inventory stocks again edged higher; the inventory-to-sales\nratio for this sector was well within the range observed over the past\nyear.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened in April but was little changed from the average for the first\nquarter; over the first four months of 1994, the deficit was\nsignificantly larger than that recorded in the fourth quarter of last\nyear. The value of exports of goods and services was down somewhat in\nApril, retracing part of a sharp runup in March. The uptrend in\nexports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery,\nespecially to expanding markets in Asia. The value of imports of\ngoods and services was about the same in April as in March; increases\nin consumer goods, machinery, and oil were offset by declines in other\ncategories. The economies of all the major foreign industrial\ncountries expanded in the first quarter of 1994. Growth resumed in\nJapan, western Germany, and France, while economic expansion continued\nat a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nBroad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen\nmoderately through the first five months of the year. In May, the\nrise in the overall index of consumer prices continued to be held down\nby declines in energy prices. Excluding the food and energy\ncomponents, the increase in consumer prices in the twelve months\nending in May was smaller than that for the previous twelve months.\nProducer prices of finished goods continued to edge lower in May,\nreflecting further declines in prices of finished foods and energy\ngoods. Producer prices for items other than food and energy increased\nat a faster rate in May, but the change over the twelve-month period\nending in May was very small. At an earlier stage of processing,\nproducer prices of crude materials other than food and energy\nregistered another small decline in May, although the index was\nsubstantially higher in May than a year ago. Furthermore, prices of\nmany basic industrial materials had remained under upward pressure.\nAverage hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers\nincreased by a larger amount in May than in April, but the rise over\nthe twelve months ended in May was about the same as in the previous\ntwelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on May 17, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure\non reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the\ndiscount rate. The directive did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any further adjustment to policy during the\nintermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nImmediately after the conclusion of the May meeting, the\nBoard of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the\ndiscount rate, to 3-1/2 percent, and the Committee permitted the full\namount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in reserve\nmarkets. Thereafter, open market operations were conducted with a\nview to maintaining the less accommodative degree of reserve pressure\nsought by the Committee. After the policy change, the federal funds\nrate rose 1/2 percentage point, to 4-1/4 percent, and remained at\nabout that level over the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus\nseasonal borrowing trended higher over the intermeeting period,\nreflecting the usual seasonal pickup in lending activity, and averaged\nclose to anticipated levels.\n\nMarket interest rates on instruments with more than three-month maturities moved lower immediately following the announcement of\nthe Committee's action, although some very short-term interest rates\nmoved up. The commercial bank prime rate also was raised by 1/2\npercentage point, to 7-1/4 percent. Market participants apparently\ninterpreted the policy actions and the accompanying announcement as\nsignaling that the System would not take further tightening actions as\nsoon as they had anticipated earlier. Incoming data suggesting\nsluggish spending and subdued inflation tended to confirm these market\nassessments. Late in the intermeeting period, however, bond yields\nretraced these declines, partly in association with a weakening dollar\nin foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. Most major\nindexes of equity prices rose early in the intermeeting period, but\nthey then moved lower in sympathy with the declines in bond prices and\nthe dollar and ended the period with small losses.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies fell significantly further on balance over the\nintermeeting period. The renewed decline, which began toward the\nmiddle of June, occurred in response to indications of an improved\neconomic outlook abroad, associated increases in foreign bond yields,\nand heightened concerns about possible increases in U.S. inflation.\nDevelopments suggesting less favorable prospects for progress in U.S.\nJapanese trade negotiations also tended to strengthen the yen against\nthe dollar.\n\nThe broad monetary aggregates were weaker than the Committee\nanticipated at the time of its previous meeting, with both M2 and M3\ndeclining on average over May and June. The declines appeared to be\nrelated in part to the continuing appeal of capital market\ninstruments. More generally, however, the rise in short-and long-term interest rates since the beginning of 1994, coupled with the\nreluctance of banks and other depository institutions to adjust their\noffering rates promptly, had produced a widening of the opportunity\ncosts of holding deposits and had led households to move deposit\nmonies into direct and indirect holdings of market instruments. For\nthe year through June, both M2 and M3 were at the bottom of the\nCommittee's ranges for 1994, and total domestic nonfinancial debt had\nexpanded at a moderate rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy was operating at a level close to capacity and that the\nexpansion would slow over the next several quarters to a rate\ngenerally in line with the growth of the economy's potential. To the\nextent that aggregate demand tended to expand at a pace that could\nfoster higher inflation, it would not be accommodated by monetary\npolicy, and pressures would be generated in financial markets that\nwould restrain domestic spending. Consumer spending, which had been\nincreasing faster than household income for some time, was expected to\nmoderate as smaller gains in employment and income, coupled with\nhigher interest rates and reductions in the value of household\nfinancial assets, exerted a restraining influence on consumption\npatterns. Business fixed investment was projected to continue at a\nbrisk pace, although growth would be damped somewhat by the expected\ndeceleration in economic activity, a growing shortfall of corporate\ncash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs.\nThe effects of higher mortgage interest rates were expected to cause\nsome slowing in the relatively robust pace of single-family\nhomebuilding. The restraint on output growth exerted by weak export\ndemand was expected to diminish because of the lower value of the\ndollar and the somewhat faster recovery now projected in economic\nactivity abroad. The staff analysis suggested that, with the economy\nalready operating close to its long-run potential, no further\nreduction in the core rate of inflation was likely over the forecast\nhorizon.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the expansion continued\nto display considerable momentum, with business activity apparently\nstill increasing at a pace above the economy's long-run growth\npotential. At the same time, indications of some slowing in aggregate\ndemand had tended to increase over the last few months. The extent of\nthat slowing remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially\nin light of somewhat disparate data on employment and spending.\nNonetheless, it was generally agreed that, in the context of\nappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, some moderation in economic\ngrowth to a pace closer to that of the economy's long-run potential\nwas a reasonable expectation. Such a slowing seemed necessary to\nforestall a buildup of inflation pressures in the view of many\nmembers. A number of members emphasized that remaining margins of\nunemployed labor and other production resources, while difficult to\nassess, now appeared to be quite limited. Although views differed to\nsome degree, the members generally concluded that the various factors\naffecting the course of inflation were likely to result, on balance,\nin little change, or perhaps a small rise, in inflation over the 1994-1995 forecast horizon. Some members regarded the risks of a\nsignificant divergence from their forecasts of economic growth and\ninflation as fairly evenly balanced in either direction, but most\nbelieved that those risks were tilted to the upside.\n\nIn keeping with the usual practice at meetings when the\nCommittee considers its long-run objectives for growth of the money\nand debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal\nReserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided\nspecific individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the\nrate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1994 and\n1995. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion\nin real GDP for 1994 as a whole was 3 to 3-1/4 percent, a little below\nthe rate of growth estimated for the first half of the year; for 1995,\nthe projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.\nWith regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts centered on\ngrowth rates of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 1994 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent for\n1995. The projections of more moderate growth in economic activity\nwere associated with rates of unemployment in a range of 6 to 6-1/4\npercent in the fourth quarters of both 1994 and 1995, about the same\nas the average unemployment rate in recent months. For the rate of\ninflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central\ntendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent for 1994 and 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent for\n1995; both ranges represented a slight increase from the average rate\nover the past year. Favorable developments in the food and energy\nsectors, which had held down overall inflation measures over the past\nseveral quarters, were not expected to continue and the drop in the\ndollar would be exerting upward pressures on prices in coming\nquarters.\n\nPursuant to a request from the Chairman of the Senate Banking\nCommittee, the members considered extending their specific forecasts\nby an additional year. Many expressed reservations about the\nreliability and thus the usefulness of numerical forecasts extending\nrelatively far into the future. Moreover, they were concerned about\nmisunderstandings of specific long-range forecasts in relation to the\nCommittee's goals and the ongoing formulation of monetary policy. The\nmembers concluded that, on balance, the Committee's policy intentions\nand expectations would be conveyed more effectively by the Chairman in\nhis upcoming Congressional testimony through a discussion of the\nimportant factors bearing on trends in economic growth, prices, and\nunemployment; the uncertainties involved in projecting such variables;\nand the role of monetary policy in achieving desired economic goals.\nIn the course of their discussion, Committee members noted that the\nAdministration's medium-term outlook contained reasonable estimates of\nthe trend growth in output.\n\nIn their review of developments in different parts of the\ncountry and sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of\ncontinuing growth in regional business activity ranging from\nrelatively modest to quite robust across much of the nation; at the\nsame time, some areas such as California continued to experience\ngenerally stagnant economic conditions. While solid growth seemed to\ncharacterize the overall economy, the members saw increasing signs of\nsome slowing in many areas. Business and consumer sentiment generally\nremained quite positive, although a number of members commented on a\nnew note of caution among some of their business contacts and some\nshaving of industry forecasts for the balance of the year.\n\nTurning to the key consumer sector, members commented on\nvarious indications of some moderation in the growth of expenditures.\nHigher interest costs were cited by some business contacts as\nconstraining purchases of consumer durables, but members also referred\nto the negative impact of persisting, highly visible cutbacks in\nworkforces by some major business firms and of growing consumer debt.\nSome members also noted that supply constraints, such as limitations\non the availability of some popular automobile models, had tended to\ncurb the expansion in sales. Looking ahead, more moderate growth in\nconsumer spending seemed likely; apart from the direct effects of\nhigher interest rates on such spending, the prospectively less\nebullient housing sector was likely to retard demands for household\nfurnishings.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was thought likely to continue to\nprovide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing\nextent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity\nand higher financing costs. While spending for equipment was likely\nto moderate considerably from the extraordinarily rapid increases\nrecorded over an extended period, ongoing business efforts to improve\noperating efficiencies would probably sustain substantial further\ngrowth in equipment outlays. Nonresidential construction expenditures\nwere expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in\nthis connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy\nrates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand\nfor space was likely to generate increased construction activity.\nAlthough higher interest costs could have some restraining effect,\nfinancing for such projects was more readily available than earlier.\nThe outlook for inventory investment remained uncertain. Some buildup\nin inventories was occurring, but business firms were continuing to\nresist sizable increases and inventory-to-sales ratios remained at\nunusually low levels. Developments that might be expected to foster a\nfaster buildup, such as some lengthening of order lead times and\nrising pressures on capacity in some industries, had not led to the\nstrengthening in inventory investment that had characterized\ncomparable stages of previous business cycle expansions.\n\nMembers observed that the outlook for exports appeared to\nhave improved and that foreign trade, on net, probably would make a\nsmall contribution to economic growth over the next several quarters.\nSome noted that business contacts were reporting strong foreign demand\nfor various U.S. products. As members had noted at previous meetings,\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement appeared to have stimulated\nincreased trade between Mexico and the United States, although it was\nstill too early to gauge the extent of this development. More\ngenerally, the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and\na somewhat greater strengthening in the economies of major trading\npartners than was expected earlier had enhanced the prospects for\nappreciable growth in U.S. exports, and in the view of at least some\nmembers that growth might prove to be considerably greater than was\ncurrently projected.\n\nMembers remarked that uncertainties about remaining margins\nof slack in the economy, accentuated by the change in the household\nemployment survey, and about potential levels of economic activity\nover the quarters ahead made it particularly difficult to assess the\noutlook for inflation. However, based on what seemed to be reasonable\nestimates of resource utilization levels and their own projections\nthat the rate of economic growth would slow to a pace nearer the\neconomy's growth potential, the members generally concluded that the\nrate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, might remain about\nunchanged or tilt slightly higher over the forecast horizon. This\nconclusion took into account the effects of the decline in the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar, the increase in oil prices on world\nmarkets, and the at-least-temporary rise in food prices. Some members\nobserved that the overall behavior of prices had been somewhat more\nfavorable than they would have predicted, given the strength of the\nexpansion and the level of resource utilization. One explanation\ncould be that increases in overall capacity and productivity stemming\nfrom business restructuring activities and investments in new\nequipment and facilities had been greater than expected. Comments\nfrom numerous business contacts around the country continued to\nindicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the\nproduction process, highly competitive markets rendered it very\ndifficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices\nof finished goods. At the same time, labor compensation increases had\nremained subdued despite indications of shortages of some types of\nlabor in many parts of the country. Exceptions involving sizable wage\nincreases continued to be cited for some industries, such as\nconstruction and trucking, that were operating at full capacity.\nNonetheless, in the absence of an uptrend thus far in consumer price\ninflation and given continuing uncertainties about job prospects\ndespite large job gains, wage pressures had remained restrained.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in February for 1994 and it\ndecided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1995.\nThe current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth\nquarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 included expansion of\n1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 4 to 8\npercent for 1994.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, which as in the past tended to\nfocus on M2, all the members indicated that they were in favor of\nretaining the current ranges for M2 and M3 for 1994 and extending\nthose ranges on a provisional basis to 1995. In their evaluation of\nappropriate growth ranges for 1994, the members anticipated that the\nprojected moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP and the\nlikelihood that funds would continue to be diverted from deposits to\nhigher yielding market instruments would be reflected in relatively\nsluggish growth in M2 and M3 and further increases in their velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to these monetary measures. In the\ncircumstances, expected growth in M2 and M3 at rates around the lower\nend of their ranges would be consistent with the Committee's overall\nobjective of fostering financial conditions that would promote\nsustainable economic growth and contain pressures on prices. Indeed,\nthat objective might even imply a shortfall from one or both of the\ncurrent ranges, but shortfalls could be tolerated and explained if\nthey reflected greater-than-expected increases in velocity associated\nwith an acceptable economic performance. While growth of the broad\nmonetary aggregates might pick up somewhat next year, it probably\nwould remain damped relative to income. In light of this prospect,\nand of the uncertainties about appropriate monetary growth in 1995,\nthe Committee decided to carry forward the 1994 ranges, subject to a\nreview early next year. The Committee noted that the current ranges,\nwhich had been reduced greatly over the years, could be viewed as\nlong-run benchmarks for monetary growth consistent with maximum\nsustainable economic expansion in a noninflationary environment, if\nthere were a return to more normal velocity behavior. The Committee\nrecognized that considerable uncertainty about the behavior of\nvelocity was likely to persist and that a broad range of financial and\neconomic indicators, in addition to the monetary aggregates, would\nneed to be monitored in determining the appropriate course for\nmonetary policy.\n\nIn their review of the Committee's monitoring range for the\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt, the members agreed that\nthe current range for 1994 should be retained. This view took into\naccount staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was\nlikely to grow within its present range this year, albeit the lower\nhalf of that range. Considerable sentiment was expressed, however,\nfor reducing the debt monitoring range for 1995. Debt growth was\nexpected to remain relatively subdued in association with projections\nof a slower rate of expansion in nominal GDP. Lowering the range\nwould underscore the Committee's view that rapid debt growth, should\nit materialize and be sustained, could have adverse implications for\ninflation and financial stability. Members emphasized, however, that\naction to adjust the debt range did not imply increased Committee\nemphasis on the debt aggregate, and most believed that the risks of\nany misinterpretation could be minimized by including an appropriate\nexplanation in the report to Congress.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to\nreaffirm the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 and the monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established\nin February for 1994. The following statement was approved for\ninclusion in the Committee's domestic policy directive:\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent\nand 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.\nThe Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist\nduring the year and that money growth within these\nranges would be consistent with its broad policy\nobjectives. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8\npercent for the year.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,\nKelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nFor the year 1995, the Committee approved provisional ranges\nfor M2 and M3 that were unchanged from the 1994 ranges. The Committee\nreduced the monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt by one percentage point from 1994 to a range of 3 to 7 percent.\nAccordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following\nstatement regarding the 1995 ranges in its domestic policy directive:\n\nFor 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative\nranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to\n5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The\nCommittee provisionally set the associated monitoring\nrange for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to\n7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,\nKelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, most members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The economy seemed\nto be slowing, although to an uncertain extent. Earlier policy\ntightening actions were being reflected in the sluggish behavior of\nmoney and reserves, although the extent of their effects on spending\nwere still in question. Inflation was a concern, but direct evidence\nof additional pressures on costs and prices was quite fragmentary. In\nthese circumstances, all but one of the members concluded that it\nwould be prudent for the Committee to assess further developments\nbefore taking any action. One member believed that prompt further\ntightening was needed to avert the development of greater inflation.\n\nIn the discussion of the near-term course of policy, the\nmembers took account of the substantial weakness of the dollar in\nforeign exchange markets over the course of recent weeks. By itself,\nthe drop in the dollar could put some pressure on resources and\nprices. However, the members agreed that these effects needed to be\nconsidered in the context of overall prospects for the economy and\nfinancial markets, and policy should not be focused narrowly on the\ndollar alone. In any case, given the negative sentiment in the\nforeign exchange markets, the effects on the dollar that would flow\nfrom a small change in policy were uncertain. Ultimately, the most\neffective support that monetary policy could provide for the dollar\nwas to foster the objectives of sustainable economic growth and\nprogress toward price stability.\n\nWith regard to possible changes in policy during the\nintermeeting period, a majority favored a change in the intermeeting\ninstruction in the directive from symmetry to asymmetry toward\nrestraint. Some of the members indicated that near-term developments\nwere not likely to call for an adjustment to policy. Nonetheless, the\nrisk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high, given an\neconomy that appeared to be operating at or very close to full\ncapacity, and they believed that the probable direction of the next\npolicy move was likely to be in the direction of restraint. Some\nemphasized that such a move should be made promptly in response to\ninformation suggesting a greater potential for inflation. In the view\nof many, though not all, members the costs of policy errors were\nasymmetrical at this point. The costs of reversing a policy stance\nthat turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat\nslower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so\nwell established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic\nadjustment were remote. On the other hand, a policy that turned out\nto be unduly stimulative would foster greater inflation and\ninflationary expectations that probably could be reversed only at the\ncost of considerable disruption in financial markets and the economy.\nIt also was noted that an asymmetric directive would underscore the\nCommittee's determination to resist greater inflation; the asymmetry\ncould be viewed as a logical extension of the strategy adopted in\nFebruary to move to a policy stance consistent with averting\ninflationary pressures in a firmly established expansion.\n\nSome members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric\ndirective. These members did not rule out the possible need for\nfurther policy tightening, but they believed that the risks\nsurrounding current forecasts were about evenly weighted in both\ndirections. One member expressed strong reservations about the use of\nan asymmetric directive on the grounds that such language made\nintermeeting changes more likely and in the view of that member\nmarkets reacted more favorably when actions were taken and announced\nat regular meetings. However, all those favoring a symmetric\ndirective with an unchanged policy stance could accept an asymmetric\nintermeeting instruction.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they could support a directive that\ncalled for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of\nreserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the\nbroader monetary aggregates over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity recorded another substantial\ngain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource\nutilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm\npayroll employment have been relatively large on\naverage in recent months; the civilian unemployment\nrate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in\nMay. The rise in industrial production slackened in\nApril and May, primarily because capacity constraints\nprevented normal seasonal increases in the production\nof motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has\nslowed in recent months after very large increases in\nFebruary and March. Housing starts have rebounded from\nwinter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated\nfourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital\ngoods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending\non business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in\nthe first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade\nin goods and services was larger in April than in March\nbut about unchanged from the average for the first\nquarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and\nproducer prices have remained moderate in recent\nmonths, though prices of many basic industrial\nmaterials have risen.\n\nOn May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved\nan increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2\npercent. Most market interest rates were up slightly\non balance since the May meeting; declines in bond\nyields early in the intermeeting period were offset\nlater by market reactions to a weakening dollar in\nforeign exchange markets and rising commodity prices.\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the\nother G-10 currencies was down significantly further on\nbalance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a\nsizable drop since early June.\n\nM2 and M3 declined on average over May and June;\nfor the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the\nbottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate\nrate in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent\nand 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the\nfourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.\nThe Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist\nduring the year and that money growth within these\nranges would be consistent with its broad policy\nobjectives. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed\non tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of\n1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for\nM3. The Committee provisionally set the associated\nmonitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial\ndebt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,\nLaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that additional\nnear-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation. The\ntightening actions implemented thus far this year were moderate by\nhistorical standards, and he doubted that they would prove sufficient\nto prevent higher inflation given the strength of the economic\nexpansion, the minimal remaining margins of unemployed labor and other\nproducer resources, and inflationary expectations that he feared might\nalready be rising.\n\nPrior to the conclusion of this meeting, the members\ndiscussed the desirability of announcing the outcome of a meeting when\nno action to change policy was taken. Views differed on this issue,\nbut most of the members supported a proposal to provide a brief and\ninformal indication that the meeting had ended and that there would be\nno further announcements. Since early February, a statement had been\nreleased after each meeting, all of which had involved policy changes;\nfailure to take some step after this meeting to make clear that there\nwas no change to announce would lead for a time to a heightened degree\nof uncertainty. With regard to future announcements, it was\nunderstood that this issue along with other public disclosure\nquestions would be considered at a later meeting. The Committee's\ndecision regarding announcements would then be made public.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, August 16, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
