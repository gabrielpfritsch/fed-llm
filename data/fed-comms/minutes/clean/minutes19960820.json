There were no open\nmarket transactions in foreign currencies for System account during\nthe period since the meeting on July 2-3, 1996, and thus no vote was\nrequired of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets\nand on System open market transactions in U.S. government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period July 3,\n1996, through August 20, 1996. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomic expansion had moderated somewhat recently. Growth in\nconsumer spending appeared to be slowing, business purchases of\nequipment and structures were rising less vigorously, and higher\nmortgage rates were beginning to exert a restraining effect on housing\nconstruction. Business inventory accumulation had been quite modest,\nand production and employment were expanding less rapidly. Increases\nin labor compensation had been somewhat larger this year, but consumer\nprice inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, had remained on\na fairly steady trend.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment increased relatively\nrapidly in July, though at a considerably slower pace than in the\nsecond quarter. Job growth in the services industry slowed sharply,\nand manufacturing employment declined appreciably after having risen\nsomewhat in the second quarter. In contrast, the expansion in\nemployment in wholesale and retail trade picked up slightly in July,\nand the number of jobs in construction continued to increase at about\nthe second-quarter pace. The average workweek for private production\nor nonsupervisory workers fell considerably in July, to a level a\nlittle below its average for the second quarter, and the civilian\nunemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent.\n\nRetail sales weakened somewhat over June and July following\nseveral months of robust growth. Sales of motor vehicles were down in\nboth months, and spending on other goods rose sluggishly on balance.\nHousing starts fell somewhat further in July, reflecting a sizable\ndecline in single-family starts that more than offset a bounceback in\nmultifamily starts. The drop in housing starts, coupled with lower\nsales of new and existing homes in June (latest data available),\nsuggested that the rise in mortgage rates was exerting a damping\neffect on housing demand and homebuilding activity.\n\nGrowth in business spending on durable equipment and\nnonresidential structures had slowed after a very rapid expansion\nearlier in the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods were\nlittle changed in June after a sizable increase in May. Weakness in\noutlays for aircraft more than offset persisting strength in spending\non office and computing equipment, and purchases of other types of\nequipment, notably communications and industrial equipment, continued\nto advance briskly. Nonresidential construction activity rebounded in\nJune from an appreciable decline in May. The pace of office building\npicked up, and construction of other commercial and industrial\nstructures posted healthy gains after May declines.\n\nBusiness inventories increased by a modest amount in June\nafter having contracted in May. In manufacturing, inventories\ncontinued to run off in June, reducing the sector's stock-sales ratio\nto near its historical low. Wholesale trade stocks also fell in June,\nand the inventory-sales ratio was in the lower portion of its range\nover recent years. Retail inventories rose in June; larger stocks at\nautomotive dealers more than accounted for the increase. The\ninventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole edged higher but\nremained at a relatively low level.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed in June, but on a quarterly average basis the deficit widened\nin the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter. In June,\nthe value of exports declined slightly, but the value of imports\ndropped by a considerably larger amount from a relatively high rate in\nMay. Available information suggested that economic activity in the\nmajor foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an\nuneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in\nthe first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had\noccurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first\nquarter.\n\nAt its meeting on July 2-3, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nand slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nWith economic growth moderating and inflation quiescent, open\nmarket operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree\nof pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period.\nThe federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level\nexpected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of\nunexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August.\nOn balance, most other short-term market interest rates declined\nslightly, and intermediate- and long-term rates fell somewhat more,\nover the intermeeting period. In the days immediately following the\nmeeting, rates rose sharply in response to incoming data, notably the\nemployment report for June that market participants viewed as\nindicating increasing pressures on economic resources and labor costs.\nSubsequently, however, that rise was more than reversed when further\ndata releases were interpreted as suggesting that the economic\nexpansion might be slowing and that the upturn in labor compensation\nwas mild. Equity prices also exhibited considerable volatility over\nthe period since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, with major indexes\nof stock prices falling steeply through late July before recouping\npart to most of their losses in association with the bond market rally\nand favorable earnings reports.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over\nthe intermeeting period. The flow of information suggesting a slowing\nin U.S. economic growth and reduced prospects for a near-term\ntightening of Federal Reserve policy weighed against the dollar. On\nthe other hand, the yen was bolstered by incoming data suggesting that\nthe Japanese current account surplus was again widening, and the\nGerman mark benefited from the Bundesbank's inaction at a time when\nmarket participants were expecting a policy easing.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 moderated in July. Much of the slowdown\nin the expansion of M2 was associated with an unexpected decline in\ndemand deposits, which had grown rapidly earlier in the year. With\nbank credit expanding sluggishly, the funding needs of banks were\nmodest, and the slower growth of M2 showed through to M3. For the\nyear through July, both aggregates were estimated to have increased at\nrates somewhat below the upper bounds of their respective ranges for\nthe year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been\nmoderate on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle\nportion of its range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above,\nthe economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was\nprojected to expand at a more moderate pace that would be in line with\nthe projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect of\nthe earlier run-up in equity prices on household wealth and the generally\nample availability of credit were expected to balance continuing\nconsumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the\nrestraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was\nforecast to slow somewhat in response to the backup in residential\nmortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context\nof sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow\naffordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and\nstructures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the\nanticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance, the\nexternal sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on\neconomic activity over the projection period. Only modest fiscal\nrestraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Inflation\nrecently had been lifted by adverse developments in energy markets and\nwas projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the\nhigh level of resource utilization, the effects of tight grain\nsupplies on food prices, and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation\nreinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that on balance the information\nreceived since the July meeting, including anecdotal reports from\naround the nation, pointed to some slowing in the growth of economic\nactivity from a very rapid pace during the spring. The extent of the\nslowing remained uncertain, and it was unclear at this juncture\nwhether the expansion would slow sufficiently to contain pressures on\nlabor and other producer resources. Nonetheless, broad measures of\nprice inflation, adjusted to exclude their volatile food and energy\ncomponents, did not exhibit any uptrend despite robust growth in\neconomic activity this year and high levels of resource use. Indeed,\nsome price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through\nthe second quarter. Moreover, there were no early signs of pressures\nor imbalances in the industrial sector. In labor markets, however,\nthere were increasing indications of tightness that might at some\npoint feed through to greater inflation. Upward wage adjustments were\nbecoming more evident and increases in overall compensation had edged\nup, suggesting the possibility of further increases in labor costs at\ncurrent or higher levels of labor utilization even before taking\naccount of the effects of the rise in the minimum wage. Although\nincreases in compensation might be moderated by greater productivity\nor absorbed for a time by lower profit margins, the risks seemed\ntilted toward increases in inflation at some point, especially if the\ngrowth of the economy continued to outstrip its potential and added to\npressures on resources.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, members cited a\nvariety of indications that economic growth was slowing from a very\nrapid pace, and they pointed to a number of factors that in their view\nshould promote continued, though more moderate, expansion in economic\nactivity. These included generally supportive financial conditions,\nrelatively high levels of consumer confidence, and the absence of\nmajor imbalances in the economy. It was noted that much of the\nstimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had\nbeen provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables,\nhousing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending\ncould be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied\npent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in\nintermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy. A key uncertainty in the outlook was the\nprospective behavior of inventories. Should the expansion in final\ndemand fail to moderate to a sustainable pace, business firms would be\nlikely to intensify their efforts to build their inventories, which\ncurrently were widely viewed as satisfactory or even relatively lean\nin relation to sales. While some buildup in inventories appeared to\nbe occurring in the current quarter, developments that might lead to a\nsharp increase in inventory investment, such as shortages of various\ngoods and materials and lengthening delays in securing deliveries,\nwere not in evidence at this time. Accordingly, aggressive inventory\naccumulation remained an upside risk to the projected expansion but\nnot one that was likely to materialize unless final demand were to\nexceed current forecasts by a significant margin.\n\nIn their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members\nobserved that increases in prices had remained remarkably subdued for\nan extended period in relation to measures of resource utilization,\nnotably the rate of unemployment. Such behavior differed markedly\nfrom the historical experience under similar circumstances. One\nfactor tending to hold down prices has been highly competitive\nmarkets--throughout the nation and internationally as well--that made it very\ndifficult for business firms to raise prices. Another key factor,\nthough one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the\npersistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation,\nwhich remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels\nof unemployment. This development appeared to reflect worker concerns\nabout job security in a period of major business restructuring and\ndownsizing activities as well as substantially reduced increases in\nbenefit costs, notably those relating to health care.\n\nIn assessing whether a relatively favorable inflation\nperformance was likely to continue, the members focused on a variety\nof issues. One was whether the expansion would moderate sufficiently\nto keep pressures on labor and other resources from intensifying.\nAnother was whether a rate of unemployment in the vicinity of its\ncurrent level would foster added wage pressures. Uncertainty also\nsurrounded the extent to which further increases in labor compensation\ncosts, should they materialize, would be passed through to higher\nprices. Improvements in productivity were likely to offset part of\nsuch increases, but how much remained an open question. In addition,\nprofit margins were high, but the extent to which they might narrow to\nabsorb increasing labor costs was difficult to predict. With regard\nto the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too\nearly to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases\nthis year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with\nhistorical experience under essentially full employment conditions.\nMoreover, the tendency toward reduced increases in the costs of\nbenefits might tend to dissipate, though some members commented that\nfurther economies in the provision of medical services might well be\nachievable for some period. On balance, the inflation risks in the\noutlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for\nmore inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented\nby a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices\nand perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already\nwas slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and\nthey noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal\nevidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already\nunder way. Consequently, all but one of the members supported a\nproposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. A number also\ncommented that real interest rates were not unusually low, suggesting\nthat any pickup in inflationary pressures, should that occur, would be\nmodest and readily contained. One concern was that policy tightening\nat this point might generate an excessive reaction in financial\nmarkets, both because it was not generally expected and because it\nwould represent a change in policy direction that might well lead to\nexpectations of further policy tightening. Such a development could\nhave serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the\nexpansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less\ninflationary pace. These members therefore concluded that the prudent\ncourse at this point was to await further developments that would\npermit them to assess the possible need for some tightening with a\nhigher degree of confidence. At the same time, it was emphasized that\nthe Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise\nin inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of\ngreater price pressures and before they showed through to actual\ninflation. Accordingly, they also agreed on the desirability of a\ndirective that remained biased toward possible tightening in the\nintermeeting period ahead. Such a directive would imply that any\ntightening should be implemented promptly if developments were\nperceived as pointing to rising inflation. For now, the Committee\nshould remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on\nthe outlook for inflation.\n\nA differing view gave more weight to the risks of rising\ninflation. In this view, while there were uncertainties, the weight\nof the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to\ncontain inflation and set the stage for further progress toward price\nstability. The possibility of an overreaction in financial markets to\na tightening move could not be ruled out, but such a reaction was\nlikely to be short-lived. More importantly, a prompt action would\nreduce the risk that inflation would worsen and pose difficult\nproblems for monetary policy later.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nMost short-term market interest rates have declined\nslightly while intermediate- and long-term rates have\nfallen somewhat more since the Committee meeting on July\n2-3, 1996. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 moderated in July. For the year\nthrough July, both aggregates are estimated to have grown\nat rates somewhat below the upper bounds of their\nrespective ranges for the year. Expansion in total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance\nover recent months and has remained in the middle portion\nof its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee\nagreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in\n1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth\nquarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer,\nMeyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, and Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Stern.\n\nMr. Stern dissented because he believed that policy should\nbecome modestly more restrictive. He was concerned that, in the\nabsence of a substantial and sustained improvement in productivity,\nthe prevailing pattern of demand might engender an increase in\ninflationary pressures, and that such pressures would ultimately\nthreaten the ongoing economic expansion. In Mr. Stern's judgment, it\nwas prudent at this point to resist such a development in order to lay\na foundation for the long-term health of the economy.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, September 24, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m."
