Peach and Todd, Vice Presidents,\nFederal Reserve Banks of New York, Boston, New York, and Minneapolis,\nrespectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market\noperations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period\nsince the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nsince the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning\nin mid-December 2005 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with\nthe Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico. The arrangement with the Bank\nof Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the\nBanco de Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Both arrangements\nare associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American\nFramework Agreement of 1994. The vote to renew the System's participation\nin the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting\nbecause of the provision that each party must provide six months prior\nnotice of an intention to terminate its participation.\n\nThe information received at this meeting suggested that the growth of\neconomic activity had unexpectedly moderated during the first quarter\nfrom the rapid pace seen during the second half of 2004. Gains in private\npayroll employment over the first quarter were similar to the average\nfor the second half of 2004 but weakened in March, and manufacturing production\nrose only a little, on balance, over February and March. Consumers appeared\nto have turned somewhat cautious in their spending, likely a reflection\nof higher energy prices. Housing starts fell in March after a sustained\nstretch of very high readings, but home sales continued at a rapid rate\nthroughout the quarter. Growth of capital spending, while strong in the\nfirst quarter, was down from the brisk rates of previous quarters. Sharp\nincreases in energy prices pushed up headline inflation, and core measures\nwere also somewhat elevated. Labor costs, however, advanced at a moderate\nrate. Employment continued to expand in March, although the increase was\nless than the strong advance in February. Employment declined in manufacturing,\nretail trade, and temporary help services, but most other sectors registered\ngains. The average workweek remained at its recent level, and aggregate\nhours posted a small gain. The unemployment rate moved down to 5.2 percent\nin March. Also suggesting a gradual erosion of slack in labor markets\nwere surveys indicating that some employers were finding some jobs requiring\nspecial skills harder to fill and that households were experiencing increases\nin job availability. Nevertheless, survey measures of expected conditions\nin labor markets softened somewhat in the early months of the year, and\nthe labor market participation rate remained low in March.\n\nIndustrial production continued to expand in the first quarter, but\nthe pace was slower than in the final months of 2004. Gains were restrained\nby a decline in manufacturing output, particularly for motor vehicles\nand parts, and by a reduction in energy generation at utilities, which\nwas held down by unseasonably warm weather early in the year. Mining output,\nhowever, accelerated, as did production in the business equipment and\ndefense and space equipment industries. Capacity utilization in manufacturing\nedged up on average in the first quarter, but moved down in March and\nremained a bit below its thirty-year average.\n\nConsumer spending advanced solidly in the first quarter despite some\nslowing in automobile sales. However, much of that strength was registered\nearly in the quarter, and spending in March was subdued. Measures of consumer\nconfidence declined in the early months of the year but remained well\nabove the lows of two years ago. Other factors underlying consumer spending\nalso remained favorable: Real wages and salaries continued to rise, and\nthe ratio of wealth to income remained high, although it was down a bit\nbecause of a decline in equity prices. The personal saving rate stayed\nlow over the first quarter of the year.\n\nHousing starts slowed in March, after exceptional strength in the prior\ntwo months. However, a substantial increase in the level of permits in\nMarch suggested that starts likely turned back up in April. A similar\npattern was observed in the multifamily sector. The thirty-year mortgage\nrate in the first quarter stayed in a range around its average level for\nthe past two years. Sales of existing homes were rapid throughout the\nquarter, and sales of new homes rose to another record level in March.\nHouse prices continued to rise rapidly over the first quarter, although\nrecent data suggested some slowing.\n\nGrowth of business spending on equipment and software moderated substantially\nin the first quarter from the very high rates of last year, but appeared\nto retain considerable momentum; strong gains occurred in all major categories\nexcept motor vehicles. This performance reflected favorable underlying\nfundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained\nearnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions\nin the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and\nloan markets. At the same time, construction of nonresidential structures\nremained quite subdued. Over the first quarter, outlays for manufacturing\nfacilities picked up a bit, but those for office buildings stayed low\ndespite some declines in the office vacancy rate, and spending on commercial\nstructures fell.\n\nNonfarm inventories accumulated in the first two months of the year\nat a much faster rate than in the preceding quarter, prompting a small\nincrease in inventory-sales ratios. Inventory gains were especially strong\nearly in the quarter and were concentrated in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as exports\nheld steady. The value of imported oil jumped sharply, and nonoil imports\nalso rose. Economic indicators for major foreign industrial countries\nsuggested some slowing of growth late in the quarter after a pickup earlier\nin the year. In Japan, industrial production rose briskly in January before\nfalling back; the euro-area industrial sector evidenced a similar pattern.\nBy contrast, economic activity in China and other developing countries\nshowed greater buoyancy. Consumer price inflation abroad remained subdued.\n\nU.S. consumer price inflation firmed in recent months as energy prices\nrose sharply. Core consumer prices also rose a bit more rapidly recently,\nbut the increase over the twelve months ending in March was little different\nthan over the year-earlier period. According to survey information, expectations\nof near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase\nin energy prices. As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private\nindustry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace.\nThe slowing occurred in both the wages and salaries component and the\nbenefits component and was fairly widespread across industry groups.\n\nAt its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase\nthe target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2-3/4\npercent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception\nthat, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside\nrisks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability\nshould be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that economic output\ncontinued to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices and\nthat labor market conditions continued to improve gradually. While pressures\non inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power was more\nevident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. In\nthese circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation\ncould be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that\nit would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill\nits obligation to maintain price stability.\n\nThe FOMC's decision in March to raise the intended level of the federal\nfunds rate 25 basis points was fully anticipated by the market, as were\nits retention in the accompanying statement of the \"measured pace\" language\nand its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth were balanced. Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response\nto the statement's references to increased price pressures and to more\nevident pricing power as well as to the Committee's conditioning of its\nrisk assessment on \"appropriate monetary policy action.\" Interest rates\nrose further the next day following the release of a larger-than-expected\nincrease in the CPI for February. Over subsequent weeks, however, these\nincreases were more than reversed by weaker-than-expected data on consumer\nspending, consumer sentiment, and output. Further downward pressure on\ninterest rates was exerted by the market's response to the release of\nthe minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference\nto Committee members' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening\nwas not necessary at that time. Despite generally good first-quarter earnings\nreports, equity indexes moved down considerably in response to the signs\nof weaker economic growth. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose\non balance, apparently due, in part, to disappointing news on employment\nand output abroad.\n\nM2 expanded in March and April at about the same sluggish pace as it\ndid earlier in the year. The growth of M2 continued to be restrained by\nincreases in its opportunity cost resulting from rising short-term interest\nrates. Rates paid on its liquid components particularly lagged increases\nin market rates.\n\nPartly in response to the receipt of weaker-than-expected data for spending\nand output in the first quarter, the staff marked down somewhat its forecast\nof economic growth for 2005 and 2006. Even so, the economy was seen as\nretaining considerable momentum, and growth was expected to pick up some\nafter the first quarter, paced by business spending on equipment and software.\nConsumption expenditures were seen as likely to expand at a moderate rate\nand residential investment to slow. With exports forecast to expand a\nbit more rapidly than imports, the arithmetic net drag on the economy\nfrom trade was expected to lessen. Fiscal policy was expected to provide\na more moderate impetus to growth this year and next, following the substantial\nboost estimated for earlier years. Although economic growth was projected\nto run a bit above the staff's estimate of the economy's potential, the\nunemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with\nimprovements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into\nthe labor force. Inflation was projected to edge lower over the rest of\nthe year and into 2006, reflecting the attenuation of the impact of higher\nenergy prices and the effects of a slowed rate of growth of import prices\nand remaining slack in resource markets.\n\nIn their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,\nmeeting participants observed that incoming data over the intermeeting\nperiod hinted at possible upside risks for inflation and downside risks\nfor economic growth. Earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an\nimportant factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and a slower\npace of economic activity. With energy prices leveling out more recently,\nhowever, and the behavior of compensation suggesting a lack of pressure\nin labor markets, underlying inflation appeared to remain contained. The\nweakness in spending was widespread and could not be completely dismissed,\nbut it had appeared only very recently and could be a product of the inherent\nnoisiness of high-frequency economic data. On balance, economic fundamentals\nincluding low interest rates, robust underlying productivity growth, and\nstrengthened business balance sheets were expected to support economic\ngrowth at a pace sufficient to gradually eliminate remaining slack in\nresource utilization. Although the economic outlook generally seemed favorable,\nthere was also broad recognition of greater uncertainty attending the\noutlook for both inflation and output growth.\n\nCapital expenditures advanced briskly over the first quarter, but at\na pace significantly below that registered over the latter half of last\nyear. To some extent, businesses probably had pulled capital outlays forward\nfrom this year into 2004 to benefit from the partial-expensing tax provision\nthat expired at year-end, but the unexpected weakness in capital goods\norders for February and March seemed hard to attribute to this factor\nalone. In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices,\nthe sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist\nfor some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going\nforward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future\nand wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or\ntaking on new workers. A less buoyant and less certain economic outlook\nseemed apparent in financial markets as well, where equity prices had\nfallen and risk spreads had widened. On balance, though, these financial\ndevelopments did not appear to signal the onset of a sharp retrenchment\nin investors' willingness to bear risk, and capital expenditures were\nseen as likely to remain quite robust, spurred by strong economic fundamentals\nthat included elevated profits, opportunities to raise efficiency by utilizing\nnew technologies, a low cost of capital, and strong corporate balance\nsheets. Indeed, a substantial weakening in business investment in an environment\nwith such favorable fundamentals would be at odds with the historical\nrecord.\n\nIncoming data for the household sector were viewed as mixed. Higher\ngasoline prices seemed to be sapping consumer confidence and consumer\nspending. The pace of consumption growth had fallen off appreciably toward\nthe end of the first quarter, and some participants worried about the\npotential for continued sluggishness in consumer spending if increasingly\ncautious households sought to raise their saving rate rapidly. On balance,\nthough, strong income growth and low interest rates augured well for household\nspending. Although housing starts had dropped of late, home sales and\nother indicators of activity in the residential real estate market remained\nat very high levels. House price appreciation was expected to moderate\nover coming quarters, but a number of local real estate markets were still\nregarded as \"hot,\" with signs of possible speculative excesses in some\nareas.\n\nThe deceleration in final sales over the first quarter had been accompanied\nby a sizable accumulation of businesses inventories. The available data\nsuggested that stocks had accumulated in a variety of industries, but\nparticularly in the motor vehicle sector where the inventory of new autos\nhad moved appreciably higher. Although difficult to judge, the inventory\nbuildup was not regarded as likely to have major implications for aggregate\nmanufacturing beyond some modest production cutbacks in the current quarter.\n\nA relatively high proportion of demand had continued to be met by imports.\nSome concern was expressed that incoming data suggested weaker growth\nin some of our major trading partners, which posed a downside risk to\nforecasts for U.S. exports. Moreover, advances in domestic income were\nexpected to contribute to brisk growth in imports. Looking ahead, the\nU.S. economy was expected to continue to run quite substantial current\naccount deficits, although the impact of past dollar depreciation should\nwork to boost exports and slow the rise in imports to some extent.\n\nRecent energy price developments garnered considerable attention. Declines\nin energy prices in recent weeks were viewed as welcome, but participants\nnoted that far-dated futures prices for oil remained quite elevated and\nthat persistently high energy prices could trigger a range of deleterious\neffects on the economy. High energy prices appeared to be taking a toll\non household and business confidence and might be beginning to crimp corporate\nprofits. In some cases, firms seemed to be more successfully passing on\nenergy costs to their customers. Indeed, some portion of recent elevated\ninflation readings probably represented, at least partly, such pass-through\neffects from higher energy costs. However, while pass-through effects\ncould leave the overall price level higher, their impact on inflation\nshould fade over time, as long as inflation expectations remain well contained.\nStill, considerable uncertainty surrounded the degree of pass-through\nfrom energy prices to core consumer prices, and pass-through effects might\nbe more pronounced when energy price increases were perceived as more\nlikely to be permanent. Persistently high energy prices were mentioned\nas a factor that could trim the level of potential output to a small degree\nover time, possibly contributing to additional upward pressure on consumer\nprices at the margin.\n\nParticipants voiced concerns about recent price trends; they expected\ninflation to remain contained but also perceived that the risks to that\ninflation outlook now might be skewed somewhat to the upside. Core measures\nof price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly\nso over the last few months. A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey\nmeasures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations\nover recent months. Moreover, there were risks that the relative stability\nof long-term survey measures of inflation expectations could simply reflect\nlags in households' perceptions of changing economic prospects. The success\nthat some businesses seemed to be encountering in passing through cost\nincreases raised the possibility that competitive pressures and resource\nslack were exerting somewhat less restraint on inflation than had been\nanticipated.\n\nHowever, available indicators of wages and benefits had registered only\nmodest growth, suggesting to many that some slack in labor markets persisted.\nMoreover, market measures of inflation compensation had ebbed in recent\nweeks, and survey measures of long-term inflation expectations, albeit\na touch higher of late, remained in the broad range of recent years. Along\nwith energy prices, import and materials prices apparently had contributed\nto the recent uptick in inflation, and pressures on inflation stemming\nfrom these three sources were expected to lessen over coming quarters.\nOn balance, measures of core inflation were thought likely to remain in\ncheck over the remainder of this year and next.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting\nperiod, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis\npoints to 3 percent at this meeting. Although downside risks to sustainable\ngrowth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower\ngrowth of economic activity as likely to be transitory. In this regard,\nthe ability of the U.S. economy to withstand significant shocks over recent\nyears buttressed the view that policymakers should not overreact to a\ncomparatively small number of disappointing indicators, especially when\neconomic fundamentals appeared to remain quite supportive of continued\nsolid expansion. To be sure, the Committee had raised its federal funds\nrate target appreciably over the past year, and, in the view of a few\nmembers, a larger-than-expected moderation of aggregate demand in response\nto this cumulative policy action could not be ruled out. However, all\nmembers regarded the stance of policy as accommodative and judged that\nthe current level of short-term rates remained too low to be consistent\nwith sustainable growth and stable prices in the long run. Against the\nbackdrop of the recent uptick in core inflation and in some measures of\ninflation expectations, members agreed that they should continue along\nthe course of removing policy accommodation at a measured pace conditional\non the outlook for inflation and economic growth.\n\nIn discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members\nagreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that rising energy prices\nseemed to have spurred an increase in core measures of inflation by dropping\nthe reference from the March statement indicating that \"The rise in energy\nprices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.\"\nThey likewise all agreed that mention should be made that, on balance,\nlonger-term inflation expectations remained well contained. Regarding\nthe risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted\nthat the risk assessment conditioned on \"appropriate policy\" no longer\nseemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee's economic\nand policy outlook. Although some members noted that a case could be made\nthat the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and\nthose to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most\nlikely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and\nthe Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks\nconditional on appropriate policy.\n\nFor many, heightened economic uncertainty in the current environment\nimplied greater uncertainty about the range of possible policy outcomes\nand placed a premium on flexibility in setting policy at upcoming meetings.\nSome members commented that this greater uncertainty called for eliminating\nor paring back forward-looking language from the statement--if not at\nthis meeting, then fairly soon. In the event, most members viewed the\nforward-looking language in the statement--including the characterization\nof the stance of policy as accommodative as well as the judgment that\npolicy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is \"likely to be\nmeasured\"--as a reasonable characterization of the policy stance and its\nlikely evolution over time. Moreover, a number remarked that the language\nin its current form was clearly conditioned on economic developments and\ntherefore would not stand in the way of either a pause or a step-up in\npolicy firming depending on events. In the end, all members agreed to\nretain the forward-looking language.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize\nand direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed\notherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance\nwith the following domestic policy directive:\n\n\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial\nconditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable\ngrowth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee\nin the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent\nwith increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent.\"\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner,\nMs. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Fisher, Gramlich, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Santomero,\nand Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nAbsent and not voting: Mr. Bernanke\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nWednesday-Thursday, June 29-30, 2005.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:25 p.m.\n\nNotation Vote\n\nBy notation vote completed on April 11, 2005, the Committee unanimously\napproved the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee\nheld on March 22, 2005.\n\nVincent R. Reinhart Secretary\n\n1. Secretary's note:\nAdvice had been received that Richard W. Fisher had been elected by the\ndirectors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Dallas, and St. Louis,\nas a member of the Federal Open Market Committee for the period commencing\nApril 4, 2005, and that he had executed his oath of office.
