Gavin and McNees, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and Boston respectively\n\nMr. Kuttner, Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nMr. Hilton, Manager, Open Market Operations, Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on November 15, 1994, were approved.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee elected Mark S. Sniderman as\nAssociate Economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to\nserve until the next election at the first meeting of the Committee\nafter December 31, 1994, with the understanding that in the event he\ndiscontinued his official connection with the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland, he would cease to have any official connection with the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets since the November meeting. There were no\nSystem open market transactions in foreign currencies during this\nperiod, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod November 15, 1994, through December 19, 1994. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested a further\npickup in economic growth in recent months. Consumer spending,\nsupported by strong expansion of employment and income and by buoyant\nconsumer sentiment, remained robust. Business capital spending and\nexports were rising briskly. Payroll employment remained on a strong\nupward trend, and industrial output posted further substantial gains.\nBroad indexes of prices of consumer goods and services increased\nmoderately on average over recent months, although prices of many\nindustrial materials and intermediate supplies continued to move up\nrapidly.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November after an\nappreciable expansion in October. Job gains in the service-producing\nsector were stronger in November than in October, as a pickup in\nhiring in business services more than offset slower growth in health\nservices and retail trade. Employment in manufacturing recorded\nanother sizable advance in November, with increases widespread by\nindustry. Hiring in construction was up considerably in November\nafter a small gain in October. Job growth outpaced the expansion of\nthe labor force in November, and the civilian unemployment rate\ndeclined to 5.6 percent.\n\nIndustrial production, led by further increases in\nmanufacturing output, registered another large gain in November.\nAmong major market groups, production of business equipment surged and\nsizable increases were recorded for the output of materials and\nconstruction supplies. With the growth of production outpacing the\nexpansion of capacity in November, the rate of utilization of total\nindustrial capacity moved up further from an already high level.\n\nRetail sales continued to rise rapidly in November. Sales\nwere up solidly at most types of stores, but gains were particularly\nlarge at durable goods outlets. Consumer spending on services also\nhad grown significantly in October (latest data), with advances\nwidespread among categories of services. Housing starts increased\nappreciably in November, when construction activity apparently was\nboosted by favorable weather in some parts of the country.\nMultifamily starts rose in November to their highest level in four\nyears, while single-family starts retraced a large part of their\nOctober decline.\n\nBusiness capital spending remained on a pronounced upward\ntrend. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft were\nup slightly further in October after having advanced sharply in the\ntwo previous months; shipments of computing equipment were brisk in\nOctober, while shipments of other capital goods were little changed.\nWith regard to transportation equipment, outlays for aircraft\ncontinued to trend lower in October, while sales of heavy trucks rose\nappreciably. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods\npointed to continued vigorous expansion of spending on business\nequipment. Nonresidential construction activity advanced further in\nOctober, led by higher spending for institutional and public utility\nstructures. The uptrend in permits suggested further advances in\nnonresidential construction.\n\nBusiness inventory investment was relatively robust in\nOctober. Manufacturing inventories rebounded after a small decline in\nSeptember; a sizable amount of the October increase occurred at firms\nproducing computers, office machinery, and telecommunications\nequipment for which demand had been strong. For manufacturing as a\nwhole, the stocks-to-shipments ratio remained near a historically low\nlevel. Wholesale inventories continued to climb at a pace in line\nwith sales, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector stayed\nnear the middle of its range over recent years. Retail inventory\naccumulation slowed substantially in October; much of the slowdown\nreflected a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships. With\nsales up sharply, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector\nfell in October and remained near the middle of its range over recent\nyears.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened somewhat in October from its September level and from its\naverage rate for the third quarter. The increase in the deficit from\nSeptember's level reflected a small decline in the value of exports of\ngoods and services, which resulted primarily from reduced aircraft\nshipments, and a small rise in the value of imports. Economic\nactivity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand\nrapidly in the third quarter, and available indicators generally\nsuggested further substantial gains in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite further sizable increases in the prices of many goods\nat the early stages of processing, inflation at the consumer level\nremained moderate in October and November. Energy prices were\nunchanged on balance over the two months, while food prices edged\nhigher. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at\na slightly slower rate over October and November than in earlier\nmonths of the year and also increased a little less over the twelve\nmonths ended in November than over the comparable year-earlier period.\nAt the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and\nenergy were down over the October-November period, but they rose by a\nlittle larger amount for the twelve months ended in November than they\nhad in the year-earlier period. The increase in average hourly\nearnings of production or nonsupervisory workers over the October-November period remained in the moderate range that had prevailed for\nsome time, although a pickup in earnings growth was evident in a few\nsectors, notably construction and services. Over the past twelve\nmonths, hourly earnings increased at a slightly faster pace than they\nhad over the year-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on November 15, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for a significant increase in the degree of\npressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of\n3/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The Committee did not\ninclude in the directive a presumption about likely further\nadjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly,\nthe directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint\nwould be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, the Board of Governors approved a\n3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, to a level of 4-3/4\npercent. The increase in the discount rate was made effective\nimmediately and was passed through fully to interest rates in the\nmarket for reserves. Open market operations during the intermeeting\nperiod were conducted with a view to maintaining the tighter policy\nstance implemented immediately after the meeting, and the federal\nfunds rate remained near 5-1/2 percent. Adjustment plus seasonal\nborrowing, reflecting the usual late-autumn pattern of ebbing demand\nfor seasonal credit, declined over the intermeeting period; actual\nborrowing was close to anticipated levels.\n\nShort-term interest rates rose considerably over the period\nafter the November meeting. These rates had increased before the\nmeeting in anticipation of a policy tightening move, but the size of\nthe move was larger than expected and rates firmed a little further as\na result. Over the remainder of the intermeeting interval, short-term\nrates responded to incoming economic data, for a time rising in\nreaction to indications of continuing strength in economic activity\nand later retracing a portion of these increases in response to\nfavorable news on inflation. Rates on private money-market\ninstruments with very short maturities also were lifted somewhat in\nanticipation of the usual year-end pressures. Long-term rates\ndeclined slightly over the intermeeting period. The more favorable\ninflation data, together with the relatively aggressive tightening\naction, apparently were viewed by many market participants as\nindicating that monetary policy would be sufficiently firm to hold\ninflation in check. The revelations in early December of financial\ndifficulties in Orange County, California and concerns about their\npotential spread had a disruptive effect on financial markets, notably\nthose for municipal securities, but aside from the securities of the\naffected communities, the disruption generally was brief. Most major\nindexes of equity prices fell, on balance, over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies increased further over the intermeeting period, with\nthe dollar gaining about equally against the mark and the yen. The\nunexpected size of the monetary policy move in November, the economic\nnews received over the period, and the growing expectation that policy\nwould be tightened again before long all appeared to contribute to the\ndollar's rise.\n\nGrowth of M2 resumed in November after several months of\ndecline. M2's expansion largely reflected sizable inflows to small\ntime deposits and retail money market funds that in part might have\nbeen associated with accelerated outflows from bond mutual funds and\nreduced inflows to stock mutual funds. M3 growth slowed a little in\nNovember as some investors shifted funds from institution-only money\nmarket accounts, whose opportunity costs had widened after the\nNovember policy tightening, into direct holdings of securities. For\nthe year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the\nCommittee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its\nrange for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to\nexpand at a moderate rate in recent months, and through October\n(latest data) this debt measure had grown at a rate in the lower half\nof its monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth of economic activity would slow markedly over the next few\nquarters and then would average less than the rate of increase in the\neconomy's potential output over the remainder of the forecast horizon.\nIn the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond\nits long-run noninflationary capacity, and the forecast assumed that\nmonetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for\naggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained\nhigher inflation. Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline\nsubstantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing\ncosts, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower\nasset values. Business outlays for new equipment were projected to be\ndamped considerably by slower growth in sales, higher financing costs,\nand declining profits. Homebuilding also was expected to soften in\nresponse to higher financing costs, but the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing was anticipated to act as a partial\noffset to those increased costs. The projected robust pace of\neconomic activity abroad was expected to bolster export demand. With\nthe economy having exceeded its noninflationary potential in the\nstaff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up\nfor a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources\neased.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members referred to continuing indications of\nrobust expansion in employment, output, and spending and to very high\nand rising levels of resource utilization. They saw scant evidence at\nthis point of any moderation in the growth of overall economic\nactivity, including little apparent response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy to earlier policy tightening actions.\nSeveral observed that much of the expansionary momentum in the economy\nwas likely to carry into at least the early part of next year, with\npotential inflationary consequences, but a number also commented that\nappreciable slowing during the year to a more sustainable and less\ninflationary pace remained a reasonable expectation. It was likely\nthat much of the restraint from the policy firming actions implemented\nthis year had not yet been experienced; those actions had reversed an\naccommodative policy that had been in place through early 1994, the\neffects of which probably were still being felt in the latter part of\n1994. The members acknowledged that the timing and extent of the\nslowing in the expansion were subject to considerable uncertainty.\nHowever, with the economy now operating at or even slightly above its\nnoninflationary potential, price and wage pressures were likely to\nbuild unless the anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon. Key\nmeasures of inflation including consumer prices, wages, and producer\nprices of finished goods did not display any evident uptrend at this\njuncture, but this could reflect a delay in the adjustment of\ninflation to capacity constraints and possibly some greater\nproductivity and flexibility in the economy than had been assumed.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported\non regional business conditions, which continued to exhibit local\nvariations ranging from modest expansion in some areas to robust\ngrowth in others. Reflecting widespread strength in new orders,\nmanufacturing firms outside the defense industry typically were\noperating at high levels of capacity utilization, and there were\nnumerous anecdotal reports of tightening labor markets. As they had\nat earlier meetings, members remarked that despite the increases that\nhad occurred in interest rates, financial conditions remained\ngenerally supportive of vigorous economic activity. Some noted that\nthe financial markets were displaying a great deal of resilience and\nin particular that they had on balance weathered fairly readily the\nrecent financial problems of a number of local governments and private\ncorporations that had experienced large unanticipated losses on their\ninvestments. Banking institutions remained aggressive in their\nefforts to extend loans to businesses and consumers.\n\nIn their comments on developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members noted that consumer spending had increased briskly in\nrecent months amid indications of favorable consumer sentiment that in\nturn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income.\nIt was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in\nthe current holiday season. The anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal\nincreases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions, but some\nmembers emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual\npromotional efforts, including relatively large discounts. Some\nmembers also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that\nincreased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on\nconsumer spending, especially if consumer loan rates were to be\nadjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest\nrates. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch\nup with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects\nfrom losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp\nspending. Up to now, however, the members saw few signs of any\nmoderation in the growth of consumer spending, including little\napparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally\ninterest-sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer\ndurables.\n\nBusiness fixed investment, which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion, was likely to remain\na positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy\nduring the year ahead. Even so, as the expansion matured and growth\nin final demand tended to moderate, business investment could be\nexpected to soften. As in the case of consumer spending, however,\nthere were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal\nreports. Indeed, members saw growing indications of some improvement\nin nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion\ntended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial\nand industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm. In\nthe homebuilding sector, the latest available data did not indicate\nany weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage\ninterest rates. However, anecdotal reports from different parts of\nthe country suggested that the single-family sector might be\nweakening. At the same time, construction of multifamily units\ncontinued to exhibit strength in a number of areas, and this sector\nappeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought\nincreases in rents. On balance, some modest softening in overall\nhousing construction was seen as likely in response to the rise that\nhad occurred in mortgage interest rates.\n\nInventory investment was cited as another sector of the\neconomy that probably would exert a negative influence on economic\nactivity over the year ahead, though inventory developments are always\nsubject to a great deal of uncertainty. The strength of inventory\ninvestment in recent quarters reflected efforts to accommodate rapid\ngrowth in final demand and avoid disruptions to production in a period\nwhen supply delivery times were tending to lengthen. Inventory\naccumulation might remain elevated for a while longer, but as the\nprojected slowing in the growth of final demand began to materialize,\nbusiness firms were likely to curtail the growth of their\ninventories, perhaps sharply for some period, in order to maintain\ndesired inventory-to-sales ratios.\n\nThe government sector constituted another source of\nconsiderable uncertainty in the outlook for 1995. Members referred\nto major fiscal policy initiatives that were likely to be considered\nin the new Congress, and they discussed possible short-and long-term\neffects on the economy. However, the shape of any legislation was\nstill to be determined and it was not possible at this point to gauge\nits effects on government or private spending. On the other hand,\nspending by state and local governments was clearly trending higher\nand was likely to provide a mild impetus to the overall expansion; the\nfinancial difficulties of some local governments undoubtedly would\nserve to curb their spending but were not seen at this point as having\nany significant effect on the growth in overall expenditures by state\nand local governments.\n\nWith regard to the external sector of the economy, members\ncontinued to anticipate strengthening markets for U.S. exports over\nthe year ahead. Projected growth in exports would be stimulated by\nthe further expansion of economic activity in major U.S. trading\npartners and by the delayed effects of the weakening of the dollar\nthat had occurred on balance over the course of 1994. Some members\ncited anecdotal indications of stronger foreign demand for\nagricultural and other goods produced in the United States.\n\nDespite the evidence of vigorous expansion in overall\neconomic activity and very high levels of resource use, broad measures\nof inflation in markets for finished goods and overall wage inflation\nhad been on the low side of expectations recently. Anecdotal reports\ncontinued to point to very strong competition in most markets for\nfinal goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread\nresistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their\nraw materials and other inputs moved higher. Likewise, no uptrend\ncurrently was discernible in broad measures of wages even though labor\nmarkets were widely described as tight and labor shortages appeared to\nhave increased further recently in some parts of the country. While\nexamples of upward pressures on wages could be found in a number of\nindustries, such as construction where there were pronounced shortages\nof skilled labor in many local areas, most business firms were\nstrongly resisting sizable increases in their wages and were making\nuse of \"hiring bonuses\" and \"performance bonuses\" instead of\npermanently higher wages to attract or retain workers. At the same\ntime, job insecurities, including the potential loss of health and\npension benefits, appeared to be holding down labor mobility and\ndemands for higher compensation. However, many members commented that\nrising pressures on capacity, should they persist or intensify, could\nbe expected to foster greater inflation at some point. Indeed, there\nwere numerous reports of business plans to raise prices early in the\nnew year, and a number of members commented that inflation probably\nwould worsen somewhat over the near term. The subsequent behavior of\nprices and wages would depend importantly on fiscal and monetary\npolicy developments, the extent of inflationary expectations among\nbusinesses and consumers, and the degree of pressure that further\neconomic expansion would exert on capacity in various industries and\noccupations. Given their projections of some moderation in the\nbusiness expansion and assuming appropriate fiscal and monetary\npolicies, the members generally felt that any added inflation emerging\nin 1995 would likely be mild and could subside gradually during the\nyear.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, a majority of the members agreed on the desirability of\nmaintaining an unchanged policy posture at least through the beginning\nof 1995. Monetary policy had been tightened considerably in a series\nof steps starting in February, and much of the restraint stemming from\nthose policy moves had not yet been felt in the economy. This was\nespecially true with regard to the effects of the latest policy moves\nin August and November, which accounted for half the total tightening.\nIn the circumstances, a pause seemed warranted to give the Committee\nmore time to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the\nimpact of previous monetary restraint. This would provide a firmer\nbasis for gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any further\nmonetary restraint that might be needed to contain inflation. The\nlevel of real short-term interest rates, which had risen considerably\nthis year and were now significantly positive, the uniformly sluggish\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates, and the recent appreciation of\nthe dollar might indicate that policy was now better positioned to\nrestrain incipient inflation. It was noted that the Committee might\nhave gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without\nadverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy\ntightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of\nfavorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least\ntemporarily, concerns about future inflation. A number of members\nalso commented that financial markets might tend to be a bit unsettled\nover the balance of the year as a result of the expected year-end\nadjustments along with the uncertainty about the effects and incidence\nof the sizable market losses incurred by some investors in 1994. In\nthese circumstances, where there did not appear to be an urgent need\nfor a further policy move, a number of members viewed conditions in\nfinancial markets as arguing for a steady policy course pending a\nreassessment early next year.\n\nA few members expressed a preference for some additional\ntightening of policy at this meeting. In their view, the considerable\nstrength of the economic expansion and the high level of resource\nutilization argued for further monetary restraint to counter\ninflationary pressures; immediate action also would moderate\ninflationary expectations by reinforcing the credibility of the\nSystem's anti-inflationary effort. All but one of these members\nindicated, however, that they could accept an unchanged directive that\nwas biased toward possible firming during the intermeeting period.\n\nOn the issue of possible adjustments to policy during the\nperiod until the next meeting, a majority of the members expressed a\npreference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. While\nmost of these members preferred not to tighten policy at this point,\nthey believed that the need for further monetary restraint was highly\nlikely, though it would remain contingent on the tenor of the new\ninformation, including data on holiday retail sales, that would begin\nto arrive shortly after the turn of the year. Should the need for\nmore restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for\nthe appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any\nworsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby\nminimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and\nthe ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. The Committee\nalways had the option of adjusting its policy during intermeeting\nperiods even under a symmetric directive, but the balance of risks in\nthe outlook argued in the view of these members for a policy reaction\nto new information that was best characterized by an asymmetric\ndirective.\n\nThe other members who favored an unchanged policy preferred a\nsymmetric directive. In their view, the information that would be\nreleased in the weeks immediately ahead was not likely to depart\nsufficiently from current expectations to warrant a policy tightening\nmove during the intermeeting period. Moreover, current forecasts were\nsubject to some risks in both directions. Those in the direction of\nappreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have\na relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately\nahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious\napproach to any further tightening. Accordingly, the Committee should\nwait until the next scheduled meeting when more information, possibly\nincluding a better assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy, would\nbe available for evaluating the need for any further firming of\nmonetary policy. One member expressed the view that it would be\ndesirable to make any further short-run policy moves in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run strategy to be considered at the next\nmeeting. Despite their preferences, these members said that they\nwould not dissent from an asymmetric directive.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember indicated that they could support a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary\naggregates over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\na further pickup in economic growth in recent months.\nNonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November,\nand the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6\npercent. Industrial production registered another\nlarge increase in November and capacity utilization\nmoved up further from already high levels. Retail\nsales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts\nincreased appreciably in November. Orders for\nnondefense capital goods point to a continued strong\nexpansion in spending on business equipment; permits\nfor nonresidential construction have been trending\nhigher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and\nservices widened somewhat in October from its average\nrate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials\nhave continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of\nprices for consumer goods and services have increased\nmoderately on average over recent months.\n\nOn November 15, 1994, the Board of Governors\napproved an increase from 4 to 4-3/4 percent in the\ndiscount rate, and in line with the Committee's\ndecision the increase was allowed to show through fully\nto interest rates in reserve markets. In the period\nsince the November meeting, short-term interest rates\nhave risen considerably while long-term rates have\ndeclined slightly. The trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies recovered\nfurther over the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 resumed in November after several\nmonths of decline, while M3 expanded moderately\nfurther. For the year through November, M2 grew at a\nrate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994\nand M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the\nyear. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued\nto expand at a moderate rate in recent months and for\nthe year-to-date it has grown at a rate in the lower\nhalf of its monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of\n1994. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases could\npersist during the year and that money growth within\nthese ranges would be consistent with its broad policy\nobjectives. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed\non tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of\n1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for\nM3. The Committee provisionally set the associated\nmonitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial\ndebt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,\nKelley, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action : Mr. LaWare.\n\nMr. LaWare dissented because he favored an immediate policy\ntightening action. In his opinion, the expansion remained quite\nstrong, with high and increasing levels of utilization in labor and\ncapital markets, and he saw a serious risk of rising inflation. In\nthe circumstances, he also feared that a failure by the Committee to\ntake restraining action could heighten inflationary expectations by\nraising concerns about the System's commitment to the objective of\nsustainable, noninflationary economic growth.\n\nTemporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with Bank of Mexico.\n\nAt a meeting conducted via a telephone conference on December\n30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary increase from $3 billion to\n$4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal currency (swap) agreement with\nthe Bank of Mexico; it was understood that all drawings, including those\nunder the permanent tranche of the System's swap agreement with the Bank\nof Mexico, would be subject to a determination that appropriate terms\nand conditions had been met. The U.S. Treasury also increased its swap\nfacility with the Bank of Mexico by $1-1/2 billion to $4-1/2 billion,\nthereby raising the total for official U.S. facilities to $9.0 billion.\nThe increases were in response to recent financial developments in\nMexico. The Committee was informed at this meeting that the Bank of\nCanada would be considering an increase in its own CAN $1.0 billion\nfacility with the Bank of Mexico, and that additional official financing\nassistance was being negotiated with the other G-10 central banks and\nthe Bank of Spain.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Blinder, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, Melzer and Parry and Ms. Yellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.\n\nAbsent and not voting : Mr. Forrestal and Ms.\nPhillips. Mr. Melzer voted as alternate for Mr.\nForrestal.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to question the\ndesirability of the System's foreign exchange market intervention and\ntherefore the desirability of maintaining or enlarging the swap\narrangements that facilitate them. In his view continued System\nparticipation in such operations with the U.S. Treasury presented an\nunacceptable risk of reducing the System's credibility and its ability\nto conduct monetary policy effectively. He felt this risk was\nparticularly high in this instance. Moreover, as at the March 22,\n1994, meeting of the Committee, he had serious concerns about the\nappropriateness of the foreign exchange operations this particular\nenlargement would support. In his view, the expansion of this\narrangement was equivalent in many respects to a fiscal policy\ninitiative of a kind that should be explicitly authorized by the\nCongress.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday-Wednesday, January 31-February 1, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
