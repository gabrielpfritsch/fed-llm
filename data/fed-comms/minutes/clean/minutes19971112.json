There\nwere no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during\nthis period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period September\n30, 1997, through November 11, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, paragraph 1.A of the Authorization for\nDomestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion\nto $12 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System\nAccount holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for\nthe intermeeting period through December 16, 1997. The Manager\nadvised the Committee that, as was usually the case at this time of\nyear, the anticipated pattern of reserve needs was such that he might\nwant to add considerably to the System's outright holdings of U.S.\ngovernment securities over the coming intermeeting period. By\nunanimous notation vote, the Committee subsequently approved a further\nincrease in the intermeeting leeway to $17 billion. The increase,\neffective December 8, was made on the recommendation of the Manager\nwho saw the need for substantially more outright purchases of Treasury\nobligations than anticipated earlier, largely in light of much greater\nthan projected growth in currency.\n\nWith Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Committee authorized the\nrenewal for an additional one-year period of the System's reciprocal\ncurrency (\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks and the Bank\nfor International Settlements. The amounts and current maturity dates\nof the arrangements approved for renewal are shown in the table that\nfollows:\n\nForeign\n\nBank\n\nAmount of\n\nArrangement\n\n(millions of $\n\nequivalent)\n\nTerm\n\n(months)\n\nMaturity\n\nDate\n\nAustrian National Bank\n\n250.0\n\n12 mos.\n\n12/04/97\n\nBank of England\n\n3,000.0\n\n\"\n\nBank of Japan\n\n5,000.0\n\nBank of Norway\n\nBank of Sweden\n\n300.0\n\nSwiss National Bank\n\n4,000.0\n\nBank for International Settlements--\n\nSwiss francs\n\n600.0\n\nOther authorized European currencies\n\n1,250.0\n\nBank of Mexico\n\n12/12/97\n\nBank of Canada\n\n2,000.0\n\n12/15/97\n\nNational Bank of Belgium\n\n1,000.0\n\n12/18/97\n\nNational Bank of Denmark\n\n12/28/97\n\nBank of France\n\nGerman Federal Bank\n\n6,000.0\n\nBank of Italy\n\nNetherlands Bank\n\n500.0\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal\nReserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention\ncompromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.\nBecause sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the\nabsence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve\nparticipation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two\nundesirable outcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is\njeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-\nterm foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively,\nthe credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not\nfollow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions\nconsequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is\nassociated in the mind of the public with the failed operations. In\nthese circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap\nlines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate\nmarket intervention.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead.\n\nThe information reviewed at the meeting suggested that\neconomic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months. The\nfurther advance reflected a surge in business fixed investment and\nconsumer spending, while housing demand remained at a high level.\nSignificant slowing in exports and inventory investment provided only\na partial offset to the strength. Accordingly, production and\nemployment recorded further large gains. Price inflation remained\nsubdued despite tight labor markets and a pickup in the pace of labor\ncompensation.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in\nOctober. Manufacturing payrolls recorded their largest rise in the\ncurrent economic expansion, and aggregate weekly hours worked\nincreased significantly; most of the gain in payrolls occurred at\ndurable goods establishments. Hiring remained robust in the service-\nproducing sector, led by sizable increases at computer services and\nengineering and management services firms. The civilian unemployment\nrate fell to 4.7 percent in October, its low for the current\nexpansion.\n\nIndustrial production registered a large advance in the third\nquarter and apparently remained strong in October. A third-quarter\nsurge in the manufacture of durable goods, notably of motor vehicles,\naircraft, and information-processing equipment, more than offset weak\nexpansion in the output of nondurable goods and a decline in mining\nactivity. Although the step-up in manufacturing production boosted\nfurther the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, the latter\nwas somewhat below its most recent peak in January 1995.\n\nRetail sales posted a sharp rise in the third quarter, though\ngrowth in sales of both durable and nondurable goods moderated during\nthe quarter. Consumer spending on services also continued to increase\nat a relatively brisk pace. Growth in such spending was underpinned\nby continuing substantial gains in incomes, the cumulative increase in\nhousehold net worth over the past several years, and the ready\navailability of credit to most consumers. Housing demand remained\nstrong in the third quarter in association with moderate interest\nrates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.\nSales of both new and existing homes increased a bit, and housing\nstarts were little changed in the third quarter from the high level\nrecorded during the first half of the year.\n\nBusiness fixed investment increased at an unusually rapid\nrate in the third quarter. The rise in outlays was spread across all\ncategories of producers' durable equipment, but the largest gains were\nin office, computing, and communications equipment. Available data on\nnew orders pointed to further broad-based and robust expansion in\nequipment spending in coming months. Nonresidential construction grew\nat a moderate pace in the latest quarter despite a decline in\nSeptember. Available information suggested that construction would\ntrend upward at a modest rate in coming months.\n\nBusiness inventory investment appeared to have moderated\nsubstantially in the third quarter from the rapid rate of the previous\nquarter, and on balance stocks were at relatively low levels in\nrelation to sales. In manufacturing, stocks rose somewhat further in\nSeptember, but the inventory-to-shipments ratio for the sector\ndeclined to the low end of its range for the past twelve months.\nWholesale inventories posted another sizable advance in September; the\ninventory-sales ratio for this sector was just above the high end of\nits range for the past year. Retail stocks fell in August (latest\navailable data), more than reversing their July increase. The\ninventory-sales ratio for the sector also was at the low end of its\nrange for the past year.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially on balance over July and August from its rate in\nthe second quarter. Exports of goods and services changed little on\nnet in the July-August period but imports rose considerably; the\nlargest increases in imports were for aircraft and automotive\nproducts, but sizable gains also were recorded for computers,\nsemiconductors, and industrial supplies. Available indicators of\neconomic activity in the third quarter pointed to robust expansion in\nall the major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where\nactivity rebounded only moderately from a sharp second-quarter\ndecline. Although timely data were sparse, the economies of many\nAsian countries probably were weakening as their exchange rates came\nunder pressure, problems in their financial sectors were revealed, and\ntheir monetary and fiscal policies moved toward restraint.\n\nConsumer price inflation remained subdued in September. The\nincrease in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer\nitems other than food and energy was modest. For the twelve months\nended in September, prices of consumer items other than food and\nenergy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year-\nearlier period. At the producer level, the September rise in prices\nwas the largest monthly increment since January 1991; nonetheless, the\noverall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a\nsizable rise over the previous twelve-month period. The core index\nalso decelerated on a year-over-year basis. The rate of increase in\nthe hourly compensation of private industry workers was unchanged in\nthe third quarter, but the advance over the past four quarters was\nsomewhat larger than that for the previous four. Growth in average\nhourly earnings picked up in September and October, perhaps partly\nreflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage.\n\nAt its meeting on September 30, 1997, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging\naround 5-1/2 percent. The Committee retained a tilt in the directive\ntoward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the inter-\nmeeting period, reflecting its view that the risks continued to be\nskewed toward rising inflation. Reserve market conditions associated\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with some\nmoderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the inter-\nmeeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with\nthe Committee's intended level of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal\nfunds rate, and the rate averaged close to that level over the period.\nOther financial markets became quite volatile from time to time.\nShare prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally\nturbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the\nperiod; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, also were\nvolatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those\nmarkets. Against this background, U.S. short-term interest rates\nregistered small mixed changes over the period since the September 30\nmeeting, while Treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance.\nUnexpectedly strong incoming data on U.S. producer prices, employment,\nand wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some\ndays, but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety\nand quality, the continuing moderation in consumer inflation, and the\nperception engendered by international financial developments that\ninflation pressures were likely to remain subdued.\n\nThe dollar also was affected by the spreading financial\nturmoil in developing countries, appreciating significantly over the\nintermeeting period against the currencies of a number of Asian and\nLatin American countries. Much of the increase was counterbalanced,\nhowever, by a sizable decline in the dollar's trade-weighted value in\nterms of the currencies of the other G-10 countries. The dollar's\ndecline against the German mark and other European currencies partly\nreflected diminished market expectations of potential tightening in\nthe United States and a snugging of monetary conditions by the\nBundesbank and other continental European central banks. Further\nprogress in resolving uncertainties surrounding the European Monetary\nUnion also may have contributed to the rise in European currencies.\nThe dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the Japanese yen.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 apparently moderated further in October,\nthough the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk. A sharp\nslowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of\nthe deceleration of M2, and an easing in the pace of issuance of large\ntime deposits, evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit,\nalso contributed to a modest reduction in M3 growth. For the year\nthrough October, M2 expanded at a rate that was at the upper bound of\nthe Committee's range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially\nabove the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt\nincreased in recent months at a rate somewhat below the middle of its\nrange.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy would continue to expand for a time at a pace considerably\nabove its potential, but growth was expected to moderate to a more\nsustainable rate later. Further rapid increases in business\ninvestment would provide strong impetus to income growth in the near\nterm, and the rise in household wealth so far in 1997 would stimulate\nrobust consumer demand going forward. The projected strength of\ndomestic demand would be offset to some extent by a considerable\nweakening in the growth of exports in response to the lagged effects\nof the earlier appreciation of the dollar and sharp anticipated\nreductions in the economic growth of Asian and other developing\ncountries.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members focused on widespread indications of a\ncontinued solid advance in economic activity, spurred by strength in\nall major sectors of the domestic economy, and the persistence of\nsubdued increases in prices. The current momentum of the expansion,\ntogether with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable\nbusiness and consumer sentiment, suggested that economic growth was\nlikely to be well maintained, especially over the nearer term. As a\nconsequence, the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of\nadditional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on\nprices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy.\nBut the members also focused on two important influences that were\ninjecting new uncertainties into this outlook. Turmoil in Asian\nfinancial markets and economies would tend to damp output and prices\nin the United States. To date, it appeared that the effects on the\nU.S. economy would be quite limited, but the ultimate extent of the\nadjustment in Asia was unknown, as was its spillover to global\nfinancial markets and to the economies of nations that were important\nU.S. trading partners. The second influence was the apparently sharp\nincrease in productivity in the second and third quarters. This was\nan encouraging development, although it was too early to judge the\npersistence of the uptrend in productivity growth and the extent to\nwhich it might reduce the additional price pressures that would be\ngenerated in the event of an extended period of further robust\neconomic expansion.\n\nStrength in consumer spending had provided an important\nunderpinning for robust economic expansion, and substantial growth\nwas likely to persist, sustained by increases in employment and\nincomes, high levels of confidence, and the cumulative effects of very\nlarge gains in stock market wealth over the past several years. The\noutlook for capital spending also remained quite favorable because the\nfactors that were contributing to the ongoing surge in such spending--its\npotential for lowering production costs in highly competitive\nmarkets and the ready availability of finance on attractive terms--were\nlikely to persist. While private domestic demand most likely\nwould continue to display considerable strength, both consumption and\ninvestment were somewhat vulnerable to developments in financial\nmarkets, perhaps arising from further difficulties in Asia. Increased\nuncertainty about asset values could engender greater caution on\nspending, and of course a substantial decline in equity values would\nreduce household wealth and raise the cost of equity capital. Some\nmembers also commented that additional appreciation of the dollar,\nperhaps in association with possible further turbulence in Asia and\nweakness in foreign economies, would have adverse implications for net\nexports, which already were seen as a somewhat negative factor in the\neconomic outlook. At the same time, of course, a stronger dollar\nwould have a positive effect on domestic inflation over the projection\nhorizon.\n\nIn the course of their discussion, the members gave consider-\nable emphasis to recent developments in labor markets. Statistical\nindicators of rising levels of employment, low and falling rates of\nunemployment, and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced\nby anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation.\nThe demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many\nregions, and a number of members reported that growth of economic\nactivity in various parts of the country was being held back by the\nscarcity of labor. While labor compensation had accelerated, the\npickup was moderate in light of the taut conditions in labor markets\nand some of it reflected the legislated rise in the minimum wage.\nNonetheless, members cited numerous examples of efforts to attract or\nretain workers in especially scarce supply through a variety of bonus\npayments and other incentives that were not included in standard\nmeasures of labor compensation.\n\nThe effects on costs and prices of somewhat faster increases\nin compensation evidently were being muted by what appeared to have\nbeen a sharp advance in productivity growth in the last two quarters.\nThe acceleration in productivity seemed to be related in part to the\nsurge in capital spending, which had been stimulated by the ability of\nnew equipment to enhance efficiency and hold down costs, suggesting\nthat productivity might be on a higher trend for a time. But it also\ncould be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic\noutput; such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in\nproductivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by\nstretching available labor further. If the pace of the economic\nexpansion were to moderate in line with current expectations, the\ngrowth in productivity could also be expected to slow, but to an\nuncertain extent.\n\nThe trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the\noutlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation. As had\nbeen true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively\nsubdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar\neconomic conditions. The reasons for the relative quiescence of\ninflation were not fully understood, but they undoubtedly included a\nnumber of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged\nresponse to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped\nincreases in the cost of health benefits. As they had at previous\nmeetings, members suggested that these favorable influences were\nlikely to erode over the year ahead. A number of members again cited\nreports of increases in health insurance premiums next year and\nsubsequently. More fundamentally, it was difficult to predict whether\nanticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by\nproductivity gains in coming quarters and whether, in turn,\ncompetitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to\ncompensate for any increases in their costs. On balance, the members\nfelt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price\ninflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to\nconsiderable debate.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all but one member endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged policy stance, and all agreed that the risks remained tilted\ntoward rising inflation. While developments in Southeast Asia were\nnot expected to have much effect on the U.S. economy, global financial\nmarkets had not yet settled down and further adverse developments\ncould have greater-than-anticipated spillover effects on the ongoing\nexpansion. In this environment, with markets still skittish, a\ntightening of U.S. monetary policy risked an oversized reaction. Some\nmembers also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in\nproductivity, costs, and prices continued to raise questions about the\nstrength and timing of any pickup in inflation. Other members\nstressed that the unsustainable pace of domestic demand and rising\nresource utilization seemed to call for a near-term tightening of\npolicy. Some of these members noted that overall financial conditions\nremained quite supportive despite the recent market turmoil and high\nreal short-term interest rates. Credit from a wide variety of lenders\nappeared to be amply available on favorable terms, perhaps overly so\nin present circumstances. Nonetheless, all but one of the members\nbelieved that in light of the uncertainties about the economic\noutlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence\nof firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging.\nIn the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so\nstrong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for\nlabor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one\ncould be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up\nin the absence of policy action.\n\nIn their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period, the members indicated that they wanted to\nretain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing\nasymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the May\nmeeting. Such a directive was consistent with their view that the\nrisks continued to be biased toward rising inflation. Accordingly,\nthe members continued to view the next policy move as more likely to\nbe in the direction of some firming than toward easing.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in\nreserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds\nrate of about 5-1/2 percent and that retained a bias toward the\npossible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a\nsomewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nShort-term interest rates have registered small\nmixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting\non September 30, 1997, while bond yields have fallen\nsomewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets have\nfluctuated widely in turbulent trading activity and are\ndown on balance over the period; equity markets in other\ncountries, notably in Asia, have been volatile as well\nand some have registered very large declines. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar\nin terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat\non balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar\nappreciated significantly, however, in terms of the\ncurrencies of a number of Asian and Latin American\ncountries.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 appears to have moderated\nfurther in October from the unusually brisk rates of\nAugust. For the year through October, M2 expanded at the\nupper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate\nsubstantially above the upper bound of its range. Total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months\nat a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability\nand promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance\nof these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on\na tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for\ngrowth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and develop-\nments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-\nation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kelley,\nMeyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nMr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a modest\ntightening of policy would be prudent in view of the recent strength\nin aggregate demand for goods and services; such demand appeared to be\ngrowing considerably more rapidly than the sustainable rate at which\nit could be supplied without an increase in inflation. While he\nrecognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view\nof recent financial and economic developments in East Asia, he\nbelieved these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would\nhave to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed, demand\nremained robust, and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary\nexpectations were reversed. The negative impact on economic activity\nin such circumstances would be markedly greater than if a more modest\naction were taken at this meeting.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, December 16, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:10 p.m."
