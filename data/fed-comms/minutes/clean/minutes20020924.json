There were no open market operations in foreign\ncurrencies for the System’s account in the period since the previous\nmeeting.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets\nand on System open market transactions in government securities and securities\nissued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period August\n13, 2002, through September 23, 2002. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial\noutlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period\nahead.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the economy\ncontinued to expand in the third quarter, though the tenor of incoming\nreports was mixed. Data on household and business spending had been solid\nfor the most part, and residential construction remained high. Motor vehicle\nproduction provided a sizable boost to economic activity, but other factory\noutput changed little on net. Employment continued to expand unevenly,\nwhile labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend. Overall price\ninflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments\nin the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation.\n\nAggregate labor market conditions had been mixed in recent months. While\nnonfarm payroll employment registered further small gains in July and\nAugust, the aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers\ndeclined on balance over the two-month period. The manufacturing and retail\ntrade sectors registered sharp job losses in August, but those were more\nthan offset by hiring in the services and construction sectors. A hefty\nincrease in government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels also\nboosted payroll employment. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.7\npercent in August despite advances in claims for unemployment insurance.\n\nIndustrial production declined in August, largely offsetting July’s\nrise. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output was unchanged in\nboth July and August after sizable advances in the first half of the year.\nProduction in the high-tech sector jumped in August, the manufacture of\naircraft and parts fell further, and output in the remainder of the industrial\nsector was mixed. Capacity utilization in manufacturing changed little\nin August and was substantially below its long-run average.\n\nRetail sales remained relatively brisk in August despite further decreases\nin stock prices and consumer confidence. Households boosted their already\nhigh level of spending on motor vehicles in response to zero percent financing\nand larger cash incentives offered by auto manufacturers, and household\npurchases of goods other than motor vehicles continued to advance at a\nmoderate pace. According to the latest available data, outlays for services\nrose moderately in July.\n\nResidential housing activity slowed a little in July and August from\nthe robust pace of the second quarter as further declines in mortgage\nrates apparently helped to support housing activity in an environment\nof sluggish employment and diminishing household wealth. Starts of single-family\nunits fell in August to their lowest rate since last November, while starts\nin the multifamily sector in the July-August period were at their average\nrate for the first half of the year. Sales of new single-family homes\nposted a record high in July, and the inventory of unsold new homes remained\nlow. Sales of existing single-family homes in July partially retraced\na large drop in June.\n\nBased on the limited information available, business investment in equipment\nand software seemed to be advancing at a solid pace in the third quarter.\nThis reflected an acceleration in spending that was associated importantly\nwith notably stronger motor vehicle sales and a halt to the contraction\nin aircraft expenditures. Outside the transportation sector, outlays on\nequipment continued to expand at a moderate pace; in addition, the level\nof orders in July (latest data) moved above shipments for the first time\nsince early last year, and the backlog of unfilled orders edged up. Nonresidential\nconstruction activity remained on a steep downtrend in July, with further\nreductions of spending in all major categories except office buildings.\n\nThe book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor\nvehicles registered a second straight monthly gain in July after many\nmonths of heavy liquidation. Despite the rise in stocks, gains in sales\nand shipments drove inventory-sales ratios to even lower levels across\nthe manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors. Survey and anecdotal\ninformation suggested that few industries were burdened with sizable inventory\noverhangs.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed appreciably in\nJuly after two quarters of large increases. The smaller deficit in July\nreflected continued strong expansion of the value of exports coupled with\na decrease in the value of imports. The step-up in goods exports occurred\nmostly in motor vehicles and aircraft, while the gain in exports of services\nwas spread across travel and other private services. The decline in imports\nwas concentrated in consumer and capital goods, royalties, and license\nfees. The very limited available information on economic activity abroad\nin the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro\narea and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery\nin Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia. Conditions in South\nAmerica remained fragile: Economic activity was still very weak in Argentina\nand Venezuela, and the Brazilian economy had been adversely affected by\nthe turbulence in financial markets, though those markets had stabilized\nrecently. By contrast, Mexico experienced brisk growth in the second quarter.\n\nDespite a slight pickup in consumer price inflation in August, the increase\nin consumer prices (measured by either the consumer price index or the\nchain-indexed personal consumption expenditure index) for the year ending\nin August was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month\nperiod. Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food\nand energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably. Producer\nprices for core finished goods likewise signaled a drop in inflation over\nthe last year. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers decelerated sharply over the twelve\nmonths ended in August, reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment\nand the drop in consumer price inflation.\n\nAt its meeting on August 13, 2002, the Committee retained a directive\nthat called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with\nkeeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent,\nbut it shifted from a statement of a neutral balance of risks to one that\nwas tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Market\nparticipants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating\nthat economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than\nhad been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while\nbroad indexes of equity prices moved lower. The following day’s\ndeadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements passed\nuneventfully and equity markets rallied. Subsequently, however, a weaker\ntone to incoming data on production and employment, a gloomier outlook\nfor business profits, and heightening tensions over Iraq seemed to lead\ninvestors to revise down their outlook for the economy. Over the intermeeting\nperiod, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury security yields and broad\nequity indexes fell considerably on balance.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar\nin terms of the major foreign currencies appreciated slightly on balance\nover the intermeeting period as projections for growth of foreign industrial\ncountries, particularly Germany and Japan, were marked down more than\nthose for the United States. The dollar moved within narrow ranges against\nmost major currencies but rose somewhat against the yen and the currencies\nof other important trading partners.\n\nM2 growth remained elevated in August, though somewhat below July’s\nrapid pace. Much of the strength of the aggregate’s liquid components\nlikely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity\ncosts of holding such deposits, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing\nactivity, and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices. Borrowing\nby domestic nonfinancial businesses remained weak, likely reflecting reduced\nrequirements for funds to finance capital spending projects and perhaps\nthe improved tone in the corporate bond market and a modest increase in\nthe issuance of corporate debt.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light\nof weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic\nactivity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively\nbrisk pace late next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus\nalready in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and improving\nbusiness confidence would provide significant impetus for spending. Inventory\noverhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated, and business capital\nstocks appeared to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence,\na gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs,\nand the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment\nand software were expected to boost business investment spending. However,\na less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast\nperiod, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than\nhad been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain\nbelow that of the economy’s potential for a longer time. The persistence\nof underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core\nprice inflation.\n\nIn the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic\nconditions, members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked\nup in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been\nmixed, raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going\nforward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor\nand capital resources. For now, a high degree of business caution in the\ncontext of substantial uncertainties, exacerbated recently by apparently\nincreased concerns about the geopolitical outlook, continued to restrain\nbusiness investment and hiring. Even so, the economy appeared to be well\npositioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had\nbeen made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment\nwith sales, the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary\npolicies, and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for\nprofitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes. With\nthe growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the\neconomy’s potential for some time, pressures on labor and other\nresources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely\nwould continue to edge lower.\n\nIn their review of developments in and prospects for key sectors of\nthe economy, members commented that household spending had continued to\nbe well maintained. Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor\nvehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer\nmonths. While survey indicators of consumer confidence had declined this\nyear, the high levels of consumer spending on homes, motor vehicles, and\nother big-ticket items were, in the view of at least some members, perhaps\na better gauge of consumer confidence. The value of homes had continued\nto rise in most areas, and unusually low interest rates were inducing\npeople to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend\nsome of the embedded equity gains. Increasing home equity values probably\nwere also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending\nof the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market\nprices since the spring of 2000. Other positive factors cited as helping\nto undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions\nin federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer\ndurable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero\ninterest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects\nof productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes. Looking\nahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over\ncoming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members\nreferred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer\nand somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number\nof retailer contacts. Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment,\nshould it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions\non consumer spending. On balance, consumer spending was seen as likely\nto remain a positive but possibly a more limited source of support for\nthe expansion over the next several quarters.\n\nIn the context of sustained growth in incomes, low mortgage interest\nrates, by facilitating the extraction of homeowners’ equity, had\nplayed a key role in inducing a high level of spending on residential\nstructures and home improvement expenditures. Tending to confirm currently\navailable data on housing activity, members cited persisting anecdotal\nreports of robust home sales and residential construction in many regions,\nthough indications of softening were noted in some areas and market segments,\nparticularly in the high-price sector of the housing market. Some members\nquestioned whether generally rising housing prices and elevated levels\nof refinancings would persist. However, given the anticipated continuation\nof accommodative conditions in mortgage markets and forecasts of rising\nincomes, the overall outlook for housing remained favorable.\n\nBusiness fixed investment remained a significant question mark in the\noutlook for economic expansion. Recent readings on business spending for\nequipment and software pointed to gradual improvement, but nonresidential\nconstruction activity continued to be severely depressed in many areas.\nIt was unclear whether the recent strength in orders and shipments signaled\na significant acceleration in capital outlays, and in this regard the\nnew information that would become available in the next few weeks might\nprovide important evidence on the outlook for capital spending and thus\nfor the performance of the economy more generally. At least for now, however,\nanecdotal reports suggested that a high degree of caution continued to\ncharacterize business investment decisions in the face of an elevated\nlevel of uncertainty. Much of the current spending for equipment and software\nreportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the\nshort useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to\nbe little spending that would entail capital deepening. At the same time,\nseveral positive factors in the outlook for capital spending could be\ncited including the greater productivity of new capital equipment, the\ntemporary accelerated expensing tax incentives, generally strong business\ncash positions, and the relatively rapid depreciation of existing capital\nequipment. For the present, however, business contacts widely reported\nthat because of prevailing uncertainties they were deferring major investment\ninitiatives until they saw clear evidence of an increased need for capital\nto meet growing demand.\n\nBusiness firms appeared to be in the process of moving from inventory\nliquidation to accumulation, and the available evidence suggested that\ninventory positions were getting tighter. Accordingly, prospective growth\nin final demand would have to be met through increased production. And\nas demand rose over the next several quarters, businesses were expected\nto accumulate inventories to maintain desired inventory-sales ratios,\nadding in the process some limited impetus to the growth of GDP.\n\nThe growth of economic activity in most major foreign countries appeared\nto be falling below expectations earlier in the year, with adverse implications\nfor U.S. exports. Among those nations, only Canada had experienced a robust\neconomic recovery thus far this year. Current forecasts continued to anticipate\nstrengthening activity abroad, but as in the case of the U.S. economy\nsubstantial uncertainties surrounded the timing and pace of the improvement.\n\nIn the context of limited demand pressures on labor and other resources,\ncurrent forecasts continued to point to quite low and perhaps declining\ninflation over the next several quarters, although there appeared to be\nsignificant crosscurrents in the outlook for prices. Rapid increases in\nhealthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large\nincreases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.\nTending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use\nof an extended period of economic activity below the economy’s potential\nas well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently\ndeclining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing\npower in highly competitive markets. Indeed, the members did not rule\nout the emergence of appreciably lower inflation. In this regard, some\nobserved that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could\nimply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms. In addition,\nfurther sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate\nnear zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy\nthrough conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy\nthat called for negative real policy interest rates.\n\nIn the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period\nahead, all but two of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged\npolicy stance. In the view of all the members, current forecasts clearly\nwere subject to the risk that economic growth would not be sufficient\nto reduce excess capacity in labor and capital markets. However, the members\nwho favored a steady policy course noted that the recent data on household\nand business spending had been a bit stronger than expected and that a\nnumber of factors pointed to solid growth over time. In these circumstances,\nthey believed that in the context of prevailing uncertainties more evidence\nof subpar expansion was desirable before policy was eased further. It\nwas noted in this regard that the information that would become available\nover the next several weeks should provide an improved basis for assessing\nthe recent anecdotal reports from around the nation that pointed to a\npossibly slowing expansion. Several members indicated that if compelling\nevidence of a weak economy were to materialize they would be prepared\nto ease promptly. Two members preferred an immediate easing action because\nthey were persuaded by what they viewed as already strong evidence of\na persisting unsatisfactory, and perhaps weakening, economic performance.\nWhile the current stance of policy was already accommodative, they felt\nthat greater stimulus was now called for to foster an acceptable pace\nof economic expansion.\n\nAll the members agreed that the risks to the economy remained tilted\ntoward weakness and that such an assessment needed to be incorporated\nin the statement to be released shortly after today’s meeting. The\nmembers also accepted a proposal to add a reference in the statement regarding\nwhat they viewed as recently heightened geopolitical risks that appeared\nto constitute a major source of the uncertainty currently prevailing in\nthe economy. The addition was not intended to signal that any particular\npolicy response would be forthcoming in the event of a crisis. Rather,\nconsistent with its usual practice, the Committee would assess the implications\nof any such development for the domestic economy before deciding on an\naction. Indeed, if the geopolitical uncertainties were to ease significantly\nalong with what already were apparently diminishing concerns about corporate\ngovernance issues, the resulting improvement in business and consumer\nsentiment could generate a more robust economic expansion.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize\nand direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed\notherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance\nwith the following domestic policy directive.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions\nthat will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.\nTo further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future\nseeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the\nfederal funds rate at an average of around 1-3/4 percent.\n\nThe vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in\nthe press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\n\nAgainst the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee\nbelieves that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions\nthat may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough,\nBernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Jordan, Kohn, Olson, Santomero,\nand Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Gramlich and McTeer.\n\nMessrs. Gramlich and McTeer dissented because they preferred to ease\nmonetary policy at this meeting. The economic expansion, which resumed\nalmost a year ago, had recently lost momentum, and job growth had been\nminimal over the past year. With inflation already low and likely to decline\nfurther in the face of economic slack and rapid productivity growth, the\npotential cost of additional stimulus seemed low compared with the risk\nof further weakness.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nWednesday, November 6, 2002.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:30 p.m.\n\nBy notation vote completed on September 30, 2002, the Committee authorized\nVice Chairman McDonough to accept the “Decoration of Merit”\nhonor to be awarded by the government of Argentina.\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan, Bernanke,\nMs. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Jordan, Kohn, McTeer, Olson, Santomero,\nand Stern.\n\nVotes against this action:\n\nNone.\n\nAbstention:\n\nMr. McDonough."
