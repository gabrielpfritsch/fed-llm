Altig, Bentley, Judd, and Kopcke, Vice\nPresidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland,\nNew York, San Francisco, and Boston\nrespectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\nrecent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no System\nopen market transactions in foreign currencies during the period since\nthe meeting on February 4-5, 1997, and thus no vote was required of\nthe Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in U.S.\ngovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period\nFebruary 5, 1997 through March 24, 1997. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager advised the Committee that he continued to\nanticipate a pattern of reserve needs that might require another\nunusually large addition to the System's outright holdings of U.S.\ngovernment securities during the relatively long intermeeting period\nahead. The limit on increases in outright holdings between meetings\nhad been raised to $12 billion at the February meeting, and the\nManager requested that the higher limit be retained for the upcoming\nperiod. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended paragraph 1(a) of\nthe Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to raise the\nlimit on intermeeting changes in such holdings from $8 billion to $12\nbillion for the period ending with the close of business on the date\nof the next meeting, May 20, 1997.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomy had continued to expand at a relatively robust pace in early\n1997 after strengthening markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996. Much\nof the more recent growth reflected further acceleration in consumer\nspending, but business capital expenditures, housing activity, and an\nupturn in inventory investment also had contributed to the recent\nincrease in total expenditures. By contrast, available data pointed\nto a sharp drop in net exports after a surge in the fourth quarter.\nTo meet the strong aggregate demand, employment had recorded another\nlarge advance in early 1997 and industrial production had risen\nsomewhat further. The underlying trend in consumer price inflation\nhad remained subdued, but the increase in average hourly earnings had\ncontinued to edge higher early this year.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further\nin January and February. The gains continued to be led by sizable\nadvances in the services and trade industries. Employment in\nconstruction increased considerably over the two months, largely\nbecause of unseasonably warm weather across much of the country in\nFebruary that led to an earlier-than-usual pickup in building\nactivity. Aggregate hours of private production workers, which were\nalso affected by changing weather conditions, were up appreciably on\nbalance over the two months, and the average workweek increased\nconsiderably, reaching a new recent high in February. The civilian\nunemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in February, was unchanged from its\naverage level in the second half of 1996.\n\nIndustrial production rose appreciably in February after\ndeclining slightly in January. The February advance resulted from a\nsurge in the manufacturing of durable goods that was only partly\noffset by a plunge in the output of utilities associated with\nunseasonably mild weather in that month. The utilization of total\nmanufacturing capacity was unchanged on balance over the two months at\na level slightly above its long-term average.\n\nConsumer spending strengthened considerably further in early\n1997 after registering a sizable increase over the fourth quarter.\nNominal retail sales rose sharply in January and February. The gains\nover the two months were concentrated in sales of durable goods,\nincluding motor vehicles and building materials. Spending on services\nrose strongly in January (latest data) but may have moderated in\nFebruary when milder-than-normal weather held down heating costs.\nRecent surveys indicated that consumer confidence had risen to the\nhighest levels in many years.\n\nHousing construction rose sharply in February after two\nmonths of relatively depressed activity. On balance, various\nindicators of housing activity had been mixed over the past several\nmonths and did not suggest any clear trend in spending for new\nhousing.\n\nRecent trends in orders and shipments pointed to a sizable\nfurther rise in outlays for producers' durable equipment in early\n1997, largely reflecting continued rapid growth in purchases of\ncomputers and some further increase in spending for communications\nequipment. Expenditures for other types of equipment remained little\nchanged. In the nonresidential construction sector, trends in\ncontracts suggested some further spending gains in most market\nsegments after strong advances in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing\nand trade inventories rose somewhat in January, roughly offsetting\nsmall declines over the previous two months. With sales and shipments\nrising rapidly in January, inventory-sales ratios for a wide range of\nindustries dropped further from already low levels.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in January from its temporarily depressed rate\nin the fourth quarter. Nearly all the deterioration in the trade\nbalance reflected a sharp rise in imports; that increase was largely\nthe result of a rebound in automotive shipments from Canada, which had\nbeen temporarily reduced by a strike. Recent information on economic\nactivity in the G-7 countries suggested continued expansion at a\nmoderate rate on average in early 1997, but rates of expansion had\ncontinued to diverge among those economies. Growth in output still\nappeared to be relatively strong in Japan, Canada, and the United\nKingdom, while much weaker economic performances were indicated for\nthe major continental European countries. The economies of the major\ndeveloping countries in Latin America and eastern Asia apparently\ncontinued to expand in late 1996.\n\nData for January and February were consistent with the\ncontinuation of a subdued trend in underlying price inflation.\nOverall consumer price inflation moderated somewhat over the two\nmonths from its pace in the fourth quarter; smaller increases in\nenergy prices were an important factor in the slowdown, but prices of\nconsumer items other than food and energy also advanced at a slower\nrate over the first two months of the year. For the twelve months\nending in February, consumer prices excluding food and energy rose\nsomewhat less than they had over the preceding twelve months; a\ndevelopment contributing importantly to the deceleration was a smaller\nrise in non-oil import prices associated with the appreciation of the\ndollar. At the producer level, overall prices of finished goods\ndeclined somewhat in January and February, reflecting an appreciable\ndrop in the food and energy components. For the twelve months ending\nin February, the increase in the overall index of finished goods\nprices was little changed from that over the preceding twelve months,\nbut excluding food and energy prices, which had registered sizable\nadvances in 1996, the rise was considerably smaller over the latest\ntwelve-month period. At early stages of processing, however, some\nproducer prices had moved up in recent months. Average hourly\nearnings of production and nonsupervisory workers posted small further\nincreases in January and February but were up appreciably more over\nthe twelve months ending in February than over the preceding twelve\nmonths.\n\nAt its meeting on February 4-5, 1997, the Committee issued a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions. The directive included a bias toward the\npossible firming of reserve conditions, reflecting a consensus among\nthe members that the risks were clearly in the direction of an upward\ntrend in inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be\ntoward some tightening than toward easing. In this regard, the\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nand slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with some slowing of the\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOver the period since the February meeting, open market\noperations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of\npressure on reserve positions. Federal funds continued to trade\nmainly at rates close to the 5-1/4 percent level expected with an\nunchanged policy stance, though the rate did at times fall below that\nlevel in conjunction with unanticipated shortfalls in demands for\nexcess reserves. Most other market interest rates rose somewhat over\nthe intermeeting period in apparent response to indications of\nstronger-than-expected economic activity, perceptions that the Federal\nReserve had become more concerned about a possible buildup in\ninflation pressures, and perhaps disappointment over the prospects for\nlegislation to reduce the federal budget deficit. In these\ncircumstances, expectations built that monetary policy would be\ntightened. The rise in most market interest rates was accompanied by\nslight declines in a number of major indexes of stock market prices,\nalthough stock prices in some industries posted more pronounced\ndeclines.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose further over the\nintermeeting period. The dollar's appreciation appeared to reflect\nspreading perceptions of a relatively strong U.S. expansion and\nassociated increases in U.S. interest rates compared to those abroad.\nThe dollar's rise was most pronounced against the continental European\ncurrencies.\n\nGrowth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and February from\na brisk pace in late 1996, while expansion of M3 remained rapid in\nboth months. Data for the first part of March suggested diminished\ngrowth of both aggregates. The appreciable further expansion of these\nbroad aggregates thus far this year probably continued to reflect\nelevated income growth, and the relative strength of M3 was associated\nto an important extent with heavy bank reliance on large-denomination\ntime deposits to fund robust asset growth. M3 also continued to be\nboosted by the rapid growth of money market mutual funds. The\nexpansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have slowed\nin the early part of the year in conjunction with reduced borrowing by\nboth federal and state governments, which were drawing down cash\nbalances.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion in economic activity would slow in coming quarters to a\npace somewhat above that of the economy's estimated potential and\nwould moderate a bit further in 1998. Growth in consumer spending was\nexpected to decline appreciably from its recent pace but to remain\nfairly brisk over the quarters ahead, supported by further projected\ngains in employment and incomes. Expansion in business spending on\nequipment and structures also was projected to moderate, but to a\nstill relatively high rate, in association with smaller increases in\nsales and profits. Housing construction was forecast to drift lower\nover coming quarters, partly reflecting the rise that already had\noccurred in mortgage interest rates. The staff continued to\nanticipate that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert\nmildly restraining effects on economic activity over the year ahead.\nWith resource utilization high and labor compensation rising, core\nconsumer price inflation was forecast to increase slightly over the\nyear ahead.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical\nand anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic\nactivity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997. Some\nobserved that it was difficult to detect signs of weakness or\nimbalances in domestic sectors of the economy. While the members\nbelieved that some slowing in the expansion was inevitable, they felt\nthat substantial uncertainty surrounded the timing and extent of such\nslowing in the quarters ahead. Continued growth near, or even\nsomewhat below, the recent pace would raise resource utilization rates\nfurther from their already high levels. Although labor markets\nalready were tight, inflation had remained relatively subdued, and\nthere were no signs in price data that it was picking up. However,\nthe risks of a rise in inflation down the road had increased\nappreciably as a result of the strength of aggregate demand and the\nincrease in pressures on resources that likely would accompany it\nabsent a firming in financial conditions.\n\nIn their discussion of the outlook for spending in key\nsectors of the economy, members emphasized the strength of consumer\nspending in recent months. They noted that anecdotal reports from\nnumerous parts of the country and surveys indicating very high levels\nof consumer confidence tended to confirm statistical evidence of an\nebullient consumer sector. While the recent surge in consumer demand\nprobably was supported mainly by rapid growth in employment and labor\nincome, it seemed possible that consumers also were responding\nincreasingly to the run-up in household net worth stemming from the\nearlier buoyant performance of the stock market. The effects of\nrising financial wealth on consumer spending were difficult to\nisolate, and they were undoubtedly restrained by efforts to accumulate\nsavings for future expenditures such as college expenses and\nretirement. Moreover, the constraints on spending imposed by the high\ndebt burdens of many households tended to exert at least a partly\noffsetting influence on overall consumer spending. On balance,\nhowever, the members believed that the consumer sector was likely to\nprovide major ongoing support to the expansion, though the increases\nin consumer spending probably would diminish in the context of more\nrestrained growth in jobs and incomes. A number of members expressed\nthe view, however, that the risks to such a forecast were in the\ndirection of more robust consumer spending.\n\nBusiness fixed investment, which had remained on a steep\nuptrend for an extended period, also was expected to provide\ncontinuing though moderating stimulus to the overall economic\nexpansion. Growth in expenditures for business equipment was forecast\nto decline from the extraordinary pace of recent years, despite\ncontinuing brisk demand for computers and communications equipment.\nWith regard to the outlook for nonresidential building activity,\nanecdotal reports from several regions pointed to a further pickup in\ncommercial construction associated with declining vacancy rates,\nrising property values and rents, and readily available financing.\nIndeed, reports from a few areas indicated the emergence of\nspeculative building activity. On the other hand, in some regions,\nsigns of slowing nonresidential construction were reported.\n\nHousing construction activity had fluctuated in recent\nmonths, largely in response to changing weather conditions, but such\nconstruction appeared to be little changed on balance. Recent\nanecdotal reports pointed to improving housing markets in several\nregions and to some easing in a few. Looking ahead, the members\ngenerally anticipated that housing activity would be maintained at a\nrelatively high level, perhaps slightly below that prevailing on\naverage in recent quarters, barring unanticipated developments in the\nbroader economy or in financial markets. While the rise that had\noccurred in mortgage interest rates was a somewhat inhibiting\ninfluence on the prospects for housing, favorable factors noted during\nthe meeting included the ongoing effects of the large gains in stock\nmarket wealth, sizable increases in employment and incomes, and a\nstill relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.\n\nThe persisting efforts by business firms to economize on\ntheir inventories had reduced the latter to quite low levels in\nrelation to sales. In the circumstances, current inventory levels\nwere viewed as an upside risk to the expansion that could be triggered\nby unexpected strength in final demand. Absent an upside surprise in\ndemand, inventories might be expected to remain a slightly positive\nfactor in the economic outlook; and if growth in final demand were to\nmoderate more than anticipated, the currently lean inventories could\nbe viewed as minimizing the risks of accumulating weakness in the near\nterm.\n\nThe outlook for fiscal policy remained one of modest\nrestraint; on the basis of existing legislation, reductions were\nanticipated in constant-dollar purchases of goods and services by the\nfederal government in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. A key element in\nthe potential impact of fiscal policy was the uncertain outcome of the\ncurrent effort to eliminate the federal deficit over time. Although\nsuccess in that effort probably would have little effect on the\ngovernment's budget position over the next few years, it likely would\nhave some beneficial repercussions on business and consumer confidence\nand possibly also on financial markets. Financial markets would be\nespecially positively affected by an agreement to reduce significantly\nthe growth of entitlements, which would damp government spending and\ndeficits over the longer run.\n\nThe unwinding in the early months of 1997 of special factors\nthat had boosted net exports in the fourth quarter of 1996 was\noffsetting some of the effects on production of the persisting\nstrength in domestic demand. Beyond the near term, the appreciated\nvalue of the dollar was expected to hold down net exports, restraining\noverall demand and growth. Some members observed in this regard that\nthe deterioration in net exports might be substantial. While such an\noutcome would help to moderate inflationary pressures on domestic\nresources in coming quarters, it also would exacerbate the longer-term\nproblem of very large foreign trade and current account deficits.\n\nIn their review of developments bearing on the outlook for\ninflation, members commented that the risks now seemed to be tilted\nmore clearly toward higher inflation. They acknowledged that it was\ndifficult to find indications of rising inflation in broad measures of\nconsumer or GDP-related prices; indeed, such measures still could be\nviewed as consistent with a slightly declining trend in price\ninflation. Even so, prospects for a substantial period of economic\nexpansion at a rate that exceeded the estimated growth of potential\nhad generated increasing concerns of rising inflationary pressures in\nan economy that already was operating at high levels of resource\nutilization. Members observed in this regard that while there was\nlittle evidence of growing demand pressures on capital resources, the\ntightness in labor markets appeared to be intensifying. Indications\nof such a development included not only widespread anecdotal reports\nbut a variety of data such as initial claims, insured unemployment,\nand help-wanted advertising. The rise in labor force participation to\na high percentage of the working age population had helped to keep the\nunemployment rate from falling, but the unexpected increase in\nparticipation was itself suggesting tight conditions that were\ninducing marginal workers into the job market.\n\nThe data on worker compensation were somewhat mixed, but they\nsuggested some acceleration on balance. Members noted that the\ndamping effects of some temporary factors on labor costs could well\nbegin to wane soon, if they had not already begun to do so. These\nincluded the possibility that job security concerns might be\ndiminishing after an extended period of rapid job growth and low\nunemployment. The downward trend in medical cost increases might be\nin the process of shifting to a flat, if not a rising, gradient\naccording to informed observers. Moreover, as the rise in labor force\nparticipation depleted the pool of available workers, less productive\nworkers would tend to be hired, with adverse effects on productivity\nand costs. The members recognized that even though aggregate demand\npressures seemed to be pressing increasingly on available producer\nresources, it was not possible to forecast with confidence when the\nperiod of favorable price behavior would end. Even so, it was clear\nthat inflationary developments in the economy had become a matter of\nmore urgent concern for monetary policy.\n\nIn light of this concern, in the Committee's discussion of\npolicy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members supported or\ncould accept a proposal to adjust policy toward a slightly less\naccommodative stance and to move to symmetry in the directive. They\nnoted that continued relatively rapid growth of economic activity in\nthe first quarter suggested greater persisting strength in demand than\nthey had anticipated. With resource use already at high levels,\nfurther rapid growth risked greater pressures on resources and rising\ninflation. Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any\nincrease in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only\nslowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of\nfinancial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially\ndifferent from those now prevailing. In this situation, they saw a\nclear need for a preemptive policy action that would head off any\npickup of inflation, and it was noted that a shift to a tighter policy\nstance would seem to pose little risk to the expansion. Indeed, by\ncountering any tendency for inflation to rise and for higher inflation\nexpectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic\ndecision-making more generally, such action would help head off a more\nabrupt economic slowing, or even a downturn, and thereby would help\nsustain the expansion and preserve the firm labor markets and their\nassociated benefits.\n\nA few members argued that a more substantial tightening was\nneeded at this juncture to provide a better calibrated response to the\npersisting strength of the economy and the related risk of\nintensifying inflationary pressures. In their view, a more vigorous\naction would lessen the need for tightening in the future and also\nwould foster a financial setting that would be more conducive to\nsustained expansion. Other members acknowledged that a smaller policy\nmove would have less effect in curbing inflationary pressures, but\nthey felt that a cautious approach to policy was desirable at a time\nwhen the outlook for economic activity and inflation remained subject\nto substantial uncertainties. Some noted that a shift in policy\ndirection, as the Committee was about to undertake, often can have\nexaggerated effects in financial markets, making it difficult to judge\nhow much additional restraint, if any, might be needed.\n\nIn their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period, a majority of the members favored a symmetric\ndirective. While additional policy tightening might be needed at some\npoint, it did not appear very likely that developments during the\nintermeeting period would require a further policy move. Some added\nthat inflation remained quiescent and the near-term onset of an\nappreciable slowing of the expansion to a rate more in line with the\neconomy's potential could not be ruled out. Accordingly, they felt\nthat the directive should not establish a presumption about further\nnear-term policy tightening. Other members believed that growth of\nthe economy was not likely to slow enough to alleviate excess demands\nfor resources and that additional tightening would be needed sooner\nrather than later to moderate inflationary pressures and prolong the\nexpansion. In their view, the outlook called for vigilance and the\nmaintenance of an asymmetric directive with a bias toward tightening,\nbut they could accept a symmetric directive with careful monitoring of\nnew developments for any signs of the need for prompt action.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they supported or could accept a directive that\ncalled for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that did not include a presumption about adjustments to\npolicy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be\nconsistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates have risen somewhat since\nthe Committee meeting on February 4-5, 1997. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar\nin terms of the other G-10 currencies increased further\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and\nFebruary from a brisk pace over the fourth quarter while\nthe expansion of M3 remained relatively robust; data for\nthe first part of March pointed to diminished growth in\nboth aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has\nexpanded moderately on balance over recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in\nFebruary established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured\nfrom the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of\n1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint\nor slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable\nin the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve\nconditions are expected to be consistent with some\nmoderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\n: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer,\nMoskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nVotes against this action : None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday, May 20, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:20 p.m."
