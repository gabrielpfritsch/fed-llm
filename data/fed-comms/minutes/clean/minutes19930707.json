By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations reported on\ndevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market\ntransactions in government securities and federal agency obligations\nduring the period May 18, 1993, through July 6, 1993. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1993 and 1994,\nand the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period\nahead. A summary of the economic and financial information available\nat the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is\nprovided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting provided a mixed\nreading on the economy, but on balance the available data suggested\nthat the expansion had picked up somewhat during the second quarter\nfrom the very slow pace of the first quarter. Employment statistics,\nwhile tending to soften in June, pointed to considerable strength for\nthe second quarter as a whole, although recent spending indicators\nsuggested a much more moderate expansion. Consumer and producer price\ninflation slowed substantially in May, but prices had risen at a\nfaster rate over the first five months of the year than over the\nsecond half of 1992.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment changed little in June after\nregistering substantial gains in April and May. For the second\nquarter as a whole, the increase in employment matched that of the\nfirst quarter. Manufacturing employment, which was about unchanged\nover the first quarter, declined somewhat in June for a third straight\nmonth. Construction payrolls edged lower after rising appreciably\nover the preceding two months, and job gains in the services\nindustries were considerably smaller in June than those recorded\nearlier in the year. The civilian unemployment rate backed up to 7.0\npercent in June.\n\nIndustrial production increased in May at the relatively\nsubdued rate recorded in March and April; for June, the limited data\navailable suggested a modest decline in output. In May, assemblies of\nmotor vehicles declined after holding steady over the two previous\nmonths. Among other manufactured goods, the production of business\nequipment, led by computers and industrial equipment, recorded another\nbrisk advance whereas the output of non-auto consumer goods continued\nto expand sluggishly. Total utilization of industrial capacity was\nunchanged in May for a third straight month.\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures edged higher in May\nafter a sizable rebound in April from weather-related weakness. On\nbalance, however, consumer spending had increased only slightly thus\nfar this year. Outlays for new cars and light trucks advanced in May\nto their highest level since January 1990 and apparently remained near\nthat elevated level in June. In addition, spending for non-energy\nservices had increased substantially in recent months. By contrast,\nenergy consumption had fallen from the especially high levels of late\nwinter, and outlays for nondurable goods in May were still below their\nfourth-quarter level. Housing starts increased in April and May from\na depressed first-quarter pace, with most of the rise attributable to\nstarts of single-family dwellings.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods in May retraced only a\nportion of a sizable April decline. However, for the two months\ncombined, shipments of such goods were above the average for the first\nquarter and apparently remained on an upward trend that began early in\n1992. The upward trajectory for spending on machinery and on electrical and communications equipment seemed to have reflected improved\ncash flows for the business sector and a declining cost of capital,\nand incoming data suggested that outlays for business equipment would\nincrease further over the months ahead. Nonresidential construction\nactivity was unchanged over the first quarter but picked up slightly\non balance over April and May. Office building rose over the two\nmonths, while construction of non-office commercial structures was\nlittle changed and industrial building activity was down sharply.\n\nBusiness inventories recorded another appreciable rise in\nApril, and available data pointed to a further increase in May. In\nmanufacturing, inventory accumulation stepped up in April and May\nafter changing little in the first quarter: the ratio of stocks to\nshipments edged higher in each month and was only slightly above the\nvery low level reached early in 1993. In the wholesale trade sector, inventories advanced at a slower rate in May than in April, and the\ninventory-to-sales ratio fell to the low end of the range for the past\nthree years. The buildup of retail inventories slowed considerably in\nApril, and with sales rebounding from the effect of March storms, the\ninventory-to-sales ratio declined for the retail sector. Nonetheless,\nthe ratio still was near the high end of its range for the past\nseveral years.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for April was\nunchanged from March, with both imports and exports declining\nslightly. However, the April deficit was substantially above the\naverage for the first quarter, reflecting sizable increases in imports\nof capital goods, automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The\nvalue of exports in April was only slightly above the first-quarter\naverage. Recent indicators pointed to further weakness in economic\nactivity in continental Europe thus far this year. By contrast,\neconomic recovery appeared to be continuing in the United Kingdom and\nCanada. In Japan, economic activity was up appreciably in the first\nquarter, but available data suggested that this strength had not\ncarried over to the second quarter.\n\nChanges in producer and consumer prices were small in May\nfollowing sizable increases earlier in the year. Producer prices of\nfinished goods were unchanged in May, as declines in prices of\nfinished consumer food and energy products offset small advances in\nprices of other finished goods. Excluding the food and energy\ncomponents, producer prices had risen more rapidly thus far in 1993\nthan they had in the second half of 1992. At the consumer level,\nprices of items other than food and energy rose only slightly in May,\nbut this measure of inflation also had risen faster this year than in\nthe second half of last year. Labor costs likewise had evidenced a\nquickened pace of increases this year. Average hourly earnings of\nproduction or nonsupervisory workers rose substantially in May after\nedging lower in April, and these earnings had grown more rapidly over\nthe first five months of 1993 than over the preceding six months.\n\nAt its meeting on May 18, the Committee adopted a directive\nthat called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions but that included a tilt toward possible firming of reserve\nconditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive\nindicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives\nfor price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nor slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with appreciable growth of\nthe broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. Several upward adjustments were made to expected\nlevels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing during the period in\nanticipation of stepped-up demand for seasonal credit during the crop-growing season: borrowing averaged near expected levels over the\nperiod. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over the\nperiod, although quarter-end pressures in money markets pushed the\nrate higher for a brief period at the end of June.\n\nOther short-term interest rates also were little changed on\nbalance over the period since the May meeting. Early in the period,\nunexpectedly robust employment data for May, coupled with media\nreports about the monetary policy stance adopted at the May meeting,\nled to some upward pressure on money market interest rates.\nSubsequently, however, this pressure abated in response to the release\nof data suggesting slower inflation and a somewhat weaker outlook for\nthe economy. These developments along with the progress in the\nCongress toward adoption of a deficit-reduction package fostered a\ndecline in bond yields: buoyed by the drop in yields, major indexes of\nstock prices rose over the intermeeting period in spite of\ndisappointing second-quarter earnings reports by several major\ncompanies.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased on balance over\nthe intermeeting period. After depreciating somewhat through the end\nof May, the dollar recovered in early June when U.S. money market\ninterest rates moved higher. The dollar rose more strongly over the\nlast half of June, principally in response to actual and expected\nmonetary easing abroad. The rise in the dollar over the intermeeting\ninterval reflected sizable appreciations against European currencies,\nespecially the German mark. The dollar continued to fall against the\nJapanese yen through the middle of June, in the process setting\nseveral new lows, before recovering a little over the remainder of the\nperiod.\n\nAfter contracting during the first quarter, M2 and M3\nexpanded appreciably over the second quarter. Most of this growth,\nwhich was especially pronounced in May, reflected strength in Ml and\noccurred despite continued heavy outflows to bond and equity funds.\nThe May surge resulted in part from a strong pickup in mortgage\nrefinancing activity and a reversal of the depressing effect in April\nof relatively damped individual nonwithheld tax payments on the\nseasonally adjusted level of liquid deposits. The growth of the\nbroader aggregates moderated substantially in June, and by more than\nmight have been suggested by the waning of these mortgage and tax\ninfluences. For the year through June, growth of both M2 and M3 was\nbelow the lower ends of the ranges for 1993 that the Committee had\nestablished in February. This sluggishness reflected ongoing changes\nin asset preferences and financing patterns rather than restrictive\nfinancial conditions. The velocity of M2 was estimated to have\nincreased at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent over the first half of the\nyear after a 4 percent rise in 1992. Total domestic nonfinancial debt\nexpanded somewhat further through April.\n\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested\nmoderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins\nof unemployed labor and capital through 1994. The projection assumed\nthe enactment of a federal budget bill that implied a moderately\nrestrictive fiscal policy over the forecast horizon. As in earlier\nstaff projections, lower interest rates were expected to support\nappreciable gains in interest-sensitive expenditures, including\nhousing, consumer durables, and business equipment. Private spending\nalso would be buttressed by a favorable financial environment\nassociated with strengthened balance sheets and reduced debt burdens\nand by the apparently increasing willingness of banking institutions\nto make new loans. Export demand was likely to remain constrained\nover the near term by the weakness in the economies of several major\nindustrial countries, but some improvement in foreign demand was\nanticipated later as those economies started to strengthen. The\noutlook for moderate growth and continuing slack in resource\nutilization suggested considerably more subdued price increases than\nhad occurred in the early months of 1993.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, the members generally agreed\nthat ongoing economic developments remained consistent with moderate\nbut sustained growth in economic activity. No sector of the economy\nseemed poised at this juncture to provide strong impetus to the expansion, but a promising basis for further growth was seen in the much\nimproved financial condition of many households and business firms.\nLower long-term interest rates, which had contributed to the\nimprovement in balance sheets, were likely as well to bolster housing\nand business capital spending more directly. While the expansion now\nappeared to be firmly established, a number of members cautioned that\nit was subject to some downside risks, notably those associated with\nthe still uncertain outlook for government budget and other policies.\nThe possibility of higher taxes, associated with the deficit reduction\nlegislation currently under consideration in the Congress and with the\nforthcoming proposals for national health care reform, was widely\nreported to be damping spending. With regard to the outlook for\ninflation, the most recent data on prices offered some encouragement\nthat the earlier upturn in key measures of inflation might prove to be\ntemporary, especially in the context of still ample margins of\nunutilized labor and other production resources. Even so, given\ngenerally held expectations among the public that inflation was not\nlikely to decline and might in fact trend higher, many members\nconcluded that for now the disinflationary trend might have been\narrested or, at least, that further progress toward price stability\nwould be quite difficult to achieve over the next several quarters.\n\nIn conformance with the usual practice at meetings when the\nCommittee considers its longer-run objectives for growth of the\nmonetary and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members\nprovided individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the\nrate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1993 and\n1994. In light of the experience in the first half of the year,\nforecasts of real growth in 1993 had been revised down somewhat since\nFebruary, while projections of inflation had been raised. The central\ntendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1993\nwas now 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 percent for the year as a whole; for 1994,\nthese projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent.\nWith regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts converged\non growth rates of 5 to 5-3/4 percent for 1993 and 5 to 6-1/2 percent\nfor 1994. Given the projections of a moderate uptrend in economic\nactivity and expectations of some further gains in labor productivity,\nthe forecasts incorporated only a small decline in unemployment to\nrates of around 6-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993 and only\nslightly lower by the fourth quarter of 1994. For the rate of\ninflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central\ntendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1993 and 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 1994, reflecting little change in both years from the rate of inflation\nexperienced in 1992.\n\nMembers commented that the improved prospects for significant\nreductions in the federal deficit had played an important role in\nfostering the declines in longer-term interest rates that had occurred\nsince the latter part of 1992: the lower rates were having positive\neffects on spending decisions in a number of interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy as well as on balance sheets more generally.\nAt the same time, the prospects for higher taxes--accentuated by\nuncertainties about their size and incidence--were widely reported to\nbe inhibiting spending decisions by business firms and might also be\nadding to cautious consumer attitudes. Some of the anecdotal evidence\nsuggested that uncertainties associated with the potential impact of\nthe still unannounced proposals for health care reform were making\nmany businesses especially cautious, notably in their hiring\ndecisions. Adding to the effects of anticipated federal legislation\nwere concerns in various parts of the country about further cuts in\ndefense spending and the impact of additional reductions in state and\nlocal expenditures or of increases in state and local taxes. Some\nmembers observed that the fiscal policy legislation before the\nCongress appeared to have generated a perhaps exaggerated degree of\nconcern, and passage of this legislation might have a generally\nfavorable effect on business and consumer sentiment.\n\nTurning to the outlook for individual sectors of the economy,\nmembers referred to indications of an upturn in consumer spending in\nrecent months, but they also noted that survey results and anecdotal\nreports still suggested generally cautious consumer attitudes. The\nprospects for increased taxes might be having some negative effect on\nconsumer confidence, but consumers remained especially concerned about\nthe outlook for jobs and incomes as defense cutbacks continued and\nmany firms, notably larger business establishments, took further steps\nto restructure and downsize their operations. To an important extent\nthe improvement in retail sales in the second quarter was associated\nwith stronger sales of motor vehicles that, in the view of at least\nsome members, appeared to reflect previously postponed replacement\ndemand rather than a major shift in consumer attitudes. In any event,\nmoderate growth in consumer spending was likely to be maintained in\nthe context of the improved financial condition and the related\nreduction in debt-service burdens of many households. Further growth\nin overall employment, in line with that achieved in the first half of\nthe year, would if it persisted provide important support toward\nsustaining the expansion of consumer spending and thus the growth of\nthe economy more generally.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for business fixed investment,\nmembers reported that many firms were scaling back or putting on hold\ntheir capital spending plans pending a resolution of the business tax\nproposals under consideration in the Congress. Nonetheless, business\nspending for equipment still constituted a relatively robust sector of\nthe economy, at least according to the data available to date. To a\nconsiderable extent, such spending reflected ongoing efforts to\nimprove the quality of products and the efficiency of business operations while holding down the number of employees, and the members saw\nthis trend as likely to continue. In general, other business capital\nspending had remained sluggish, although construction activity other\nthan office building appeared to have picked up in parts of the\ncountry. The prospects for housing construction, though not\nebullient, were viewed as more promising particularly in light of the\ndeclines in mortgage interest rates to relatively low levels. The\nimproved financial position of many potential homebuyers also provided\na basis for anticipating stronger housing markets. Despite these\nfavorable factors, however, overall housing activity had improved only\nmodestly in recent months as homebuyers tended to remain cautious, and\nat least in some areas housing developers continued to report that\nthey were encountering difficulties in securing construction finance.\nOn balance, housing construction seemed likely to provide some impetus\nto the expansion in coming quarters.\n\nRelatively weak economic conditions in a number of foreign\nindustrial countries were likely to continue to limit U.S. exports,\nwhich had declined since the end of 1992. Indeed, available data\nsupplemented by reports from a variety of contacts suggested that\nbusiness conditions had remained quite weak or had worsened in a\nnumber of foreign industrial nations. Even so, business contacts in\nsome parts of the United States indicated that foreign demand for\ntheir products was still quite robust. Business activity abroad,\nwhich already was trending higher in a few industrial nations, was\nviewed as likely to strengthen more generally over the year ahead,\nwith positive effects on overall U.S. exports.\n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, members commented that\ndespite favorable readings recently, a wide range of price and wage\ndata had suggested some acceleration in the rate of inflation during\nthe early months of the year. To some extent, the indications of\nintensified inflation might have been the result of difficulties with\nseasonal adjustments or other temporary factors, but there were\nreports of some successful efforts by business firms to raise prices\nfollowing the spurt in demand and the rise in capacity utilization\ntoward the end of 1992. These price developments were disappointing\nand suggested to many members that the disinflationary trend might\nhave been arrested, at least for now, though the economic fundamentals\nremained consistent with a resumption of some further downward\nmovement in the rate of inflation. With regard to those fundamentals,\nmany members saw significant, albeit diminished, slack in labor and\nproduct markets as likely to persist over the forecast horizon, given\ntheir current forecasts of moderate expansion in economic activity.\nOther favorable-factors in the inflation outlook included efforts by\nbusinesses to hold down costs and increase productivity by restructuring their operations and investing in new, more productive\nequipment. Unfortunately, these favorable elements in the underlying\neconomic situation seemed at odds with the apparently widely held view\nby the public that inflation would not diminish and indeed was likely\nto increase and that in any event current inflation levels were\ntolerable. Such expectations and attitudes would tend to temper the\ngains against inflation, if any, over the forecast horizon by their\neffects on the pricing and wage behavior of business firms and\nemployees and the reactions of consumers toward rising prices. This\ninflationary climate underscored the importance of credible government\npolicies--monetary, fiscal, trade, and regulatory--that encouraged\nreduced inflation over time.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in February for 1993 and it\ndecided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1994.\nThe current ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 included expansion of 2 to 6 percent for M2\nand 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3. A monitoring range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2\npercent for 1993.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, the members focused on the\nissue of whether or not to lower the ranges further. In February, the\nranges for M2 and M3 had been reduced by 1/2 percentage point in the\nexpectation that continuing rechanneling of credit demands and savings\nflows into securities markets and away from depository institutions\nwould result in further increases in velocity, the ratio of nominal\nGDP to monetary measures such as M2 or M3. In fact, the strength of\nthese forces was underestimated to some extent. Substantial increases\noccurred in the velocity of both M2 and M3, especially in the first\nquarter, that were reflected in weak bank credit and huge inflows into\nbond and stock mutual funds. In the circumstances, the expansion of\nboth aggregates through midyear was below the lower ends of the\nreduced ranges established by the Committee for the year. According\nto a staff analysis, the developments boosting M2 and M3 velocity\ncould be expected to persist over the balance of 1993. Such an\noutcome would imply monetary growth for the year as a whole slightly\nbelow the Committee's current ranges, even if the growth of nominal\nGDP picked up in the second half of the year as implied by the central\ntendency of the members' forecasts.\n\nIn light of this expectation, many of the members indicated\ntheir support of a proposal to lower the M2 and M3 ranges further for\n1993 and on a tentative basis to retain the reduced ranges for 1994.\nIt was emphasized during the discussion that the reductions were\nintended solely as technical adjustments to reflect expected increases\nin velocity and that the lower ranges did not imply any tightening of\nmonetary policy. Rather, the reductions in the ranges would serve to\nalign them with monetary growth rates that were more likely to be\nassociated with a satisfactory economic performance. Indeed, M2 and\nM3 growth consistent with most members' forecasts might still leave\nthe expansion of those aggregates near the lower ends of their reduced\nranges for the year; at the same time, the probability of a surge in\nmonetary growth to levels above the new ranges appeared remote. In\nthis connection, some members commented that the uncertainties\nsurrounding the behavior of M2 and M3 might well persist for some\ntime. The value of these aggregates in guiding policy seemed to have\ndiminished in 1992 and 1993, and the Committee needed to continue to\nrely on its evaluation of a broad array of other financial and\neconomic developments in its assessment of an appropriate course for\nmonetary policy. The members did not rule out the possibility that a\nmore normal or predictable relationship between money and economic\nactivity might be restored once the current process of balance sheet\nadjustments was completed, the yield curve flattened, and some\nstabilization in the intermediation function of depository\ninstitutions emerged. In the view of a few members, moreover, the\nlower range proposed for M2 might in fact be more consistent with the\nrate of monetary growth that would be needed over the long term to\nsustain price stability and satisfactory economic expansion, if the\nearlier relationships between broad money growth and economic\nperformance were to reemerge.\n\nMany of these members commented that the considerations\nunderlying the desirability of a technical adjustment to the ranges\nfor this year applied to 1994 as well, and they therefore supported\nextending the reduced ranges to 1994 on a tentative basis subject to\nreview early next year. Monetary growth outcomes somewhat higher\nwithin these ranges might be anticipated in association with the\nsomewhat faster economic growth and essentially unchanged rate of\ninflation that most members had forecast for next year.\n\nSeveral members indicated that while they could accept reductions in the 1993 ranges, they nonetheless preferred to retain the\nexisting ranges. One reason given for this preference was that the\nprospective performance of the broad monetary aggregates in relation\nto developments in the economy was not sufficiently understood to\nwarrant the specification of new ranges. Indeed, a change might be\nmisinterpreted as implying more knowledge about velocity relationships\nthan the Committee in fact possessed and could set up expectations\nthat the Committee would put greater and, depending on emerging\ncircumstances, perhaps undesirable emphasis on achieving monetary\ngrowth within the new ranges. Moreover, to the extent that some\nobservers interpreted the ranges as the Committee's proxies for\npresumed nominal GDP objectives, an erroneous conclusion could be\nreached that the Committee had decided on a reduced target level of\nnominal GDP even though the Committee had not in fact framed its\nobjectives in terms of GDP targets. On balance, while these members\ndid not view this choice as a matter of great consequence in current\ncircumstances, they concluded that it was marginally preferable to\nretain the ranges for this year, and if necessary, to accept and\nexplain the reasons for a shortfall once the latter were more clearly\nestablished. The members who preferred to retain the current ranges\nagreed that there were plausible arguments on both sides of this issue\nand they could accept a proposal to reduce the ranges for both 1993\nand 1994.\n\nIn light of the limited reliance that the members felt they\ncould place on the behavior of the current monetary aggregates, the\nCommittee at this meeting reviewed the possible advantages of a newly\nconstructed measure of money. This measure involved the addition of\nbond and stock mutual funds to M2 as currently defined. There were\nindications that the shares of such funds had become closer substitutes for M2, and large portfolio shifts into such funds seemed to\naccount for much of the weakness in M2 and its uncertain relationship\nto income and the longer-run behavior of prices. After examining the\nproperties of this measure and reviewing its past behavior in relation\nto key indicators of economic performance, the members concluded that\nit would not enhance the formulation or implementation of monetary\npolicy, at least at this point. However, the members agreed that\nmutual funds flows should continue to be monitored for their effects\non M2 and that the relevant data should be made available to outside\nanalysts.\n\nAt the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee voted to\nlower the M2 range that it had established in February by an additional one percentage point and to reduce the M3 range by another 1/2\npercentage point, bringing the M2 range to 1 to 5 percent and that for\nM3 to 0 to 4 percent for 1993. The Committee also voted to reduce the\nannual monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt\nby 1/2 percentage point to 4 to 8 percent. The members anticipated\nthat this debt aggregate would continue to grow at a rate that was\nroughly in line with that of nominal GDP. The Committee approved the\nfollowing statement for inclusion in its domestic policy directive.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\nmeeting lowered the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMullins, Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, McTeer, Oltman, Ms. Phillips, and\nMr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nAbsent: Mr. Corrigan. (Mr. Oltman\nvoted as alternate for Mr. Corrigan.)\n\nFor the year 1994, the Committee approved provisional ranges\nthat were unchanged from the reduced levels for 1993. Accordingly,\nthe Committee voted to incorporate the following statement regarding\nthe 1994 ranges in its domestic policy directive.\n\nFor 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges\nfor monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5\npercent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The\nCommittee provisionally set the monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8\npercent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMullins. Angell, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare,\nLindsey, McTeer, Oltman, Ms. Phillips. and\nMr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nAbsent: Mr. Corrigan. (Mr. Oltman\nvoted as alternate for Mr. Corrigan.)\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the period until\nthe next meeting, most of the members indicated that they saw little\nor no reason to change monetary policy in either direction. The most\nrecent information on the performance of the economy was mixed, and\nthis together with questions about the course of fiscal policy\ncontributed to considerable uncertainty about the outlook. Even so,\nthe members felt that the evidence pointed on the whole to a sustained\nrate of economic expansion. The latest price statistics provided some\nencouragement that the apparent intensification of inflation in\nearlier months of the year might have abated. For now, therefore,\nnearly all the members saw the balance of factors bearing on the\ncourse of economic activity and the outlook for inflation as calling\nfor an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions.\n\nAccording to a staff analysis prepared for this meeting, the\ngrowth of M2 could be expected to slow markedly in the months ahead\nfrom its pace over the second quarter. The projected deceleration was\nmainly associated with some unwinding of the second-quarter bulge in\nmortgage refinancings along with further heavy inflows to bond and\nstock mutual funds. The expansion of M3 appeared likely to be held\ndown by weaker bank credit extensions as alternative sources of funds\nin the capital markets attracted more borrowers. On balance, modest\ngrowth of both M2 and M3 would keep them close to the lower ends of\ntheir downward-revised ranges through September.\n\nSome members cautioned that despite the very sluggish\nbehavior of the broad measures of money thus far this year, monetary\npolicy was relatively expansive as evidenced by a variety of other\nindicators including the growth in narrow measures of money and\nreserves and the very low levels of money market interest rates.\nIndeed, in the view of several members, in a period characterized by\nindications of some worsening in inflationary expectations, a policy\ncourse that maintained steady conditions in reserve markets could be\nsaid to have become more accommodative as the federal funds rate, in\nreal terms after adjustment for expected inflation, moved down from an\nalready low level. Accordingly, while current monetary policy seemed\nlikely to support further economic-expansion, the Committee needed to\nremain alert to the potential for intensifying inflation. At some\npoint the current policy stance could well begin to foster greater\nprice pressures. One member urged a prompt move toward restraint,\ngiven the prospect in his view that further progress toward price\nstability was unlikely with the current, quite stimulative, stance of\nmonetary policy.\n\nA majority of the members, taking account of the current\nstance of monetary policy, favored a proposal to retain the bias\ntoward possible tightening that the Committee had adopted at the May\nmeeting. In this connection, some commented that while the need for\nany policy adjustment during the period ahead seemed somewhat remote,\nthe next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some\nfirming than toward easing. Other members suggested that a symmetrical directive might be more consistent with current economic conditions and the related outlook for a steady policy course over the near\nterm. These members agreed, however, that a return to symmetry so\nsoon after the adoption of a directive that was biased toward\nrestraint could convey a misleading impression that recent developments had increased the Committee's concerns about the sustainability\nof the expansion or that the Committee had become less committed to a\ndisinflationary policy course. Accordingly, these members indicated\nthat they could support an asymmetric directive at this point.\nSeveral members observed that a number of key economic measures were\nscheduled for release during the intermeeting period and that the data\nin question should provide a firmer basis for evaluating the\nperformance of the economy and a desirable course for monetary policy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they preferred or found acceptable a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that retained a bias toward possible firming\nof reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the\nbroader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the economic expansion has picked up somewhat in\nrecent months from the very slow pace of the first\nquarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment changed\nlittle in June after registering substantial gains in\nApril and May, and the civilian unemployment rate edged\nup to 7.0 percent in June. Industrial production has\nchanged little on balance over the last few months.\nReal consumer expenditures edged higher in May after a\nsizable rise in April but have increased only slightly\nthus far this year. Housing starts turned up in April\nfrom a depressed first-quarter pace and rose somewhat\nfurther in May. Incoming data suggest a continued\nbrisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while\nnonresidential construction has remained soft. The\nnominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about\nunchanged in April but substantially larger than its\naverage rate in the first quarter. Consumer and\nproducer prices were about unchanged in May, but for\nthe year to date inflation has been more rapid than\nin the second half of 1992.\n\nShort-term interest rates have changed little\nsince the Committee meeting on May 18 while bond yields\nhave declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets,\nthe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the\nother G-10 currencies increased on balance over the\nintermeeting period.\n\nAfter contracting during the first quarter, M2 and\nM3 expanded appreciably over the second quarter. For\nthe year through June, growth of the two aggregates was\nbelow the lower ends of the ranges established by the\nCommittee for 1993. Total domestic nonfinancial debt\nexpanded somewhat further through April.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this\nmeeting lowered the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the\nCommittee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary\ngrowth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and\n0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set\nthe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in the broader monetary\naggregates over the third quarter.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMullins. Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey.\nMcTeer, Oltman, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Angell.\n\nAbsent: Mr. Corrigan. (Mr. Oltman\nvoted as alternate for Mr. Corrigan.)\n\nMr. Angell dissented because he favored a prompt move to\ntighten policy. In his view, monetary policy was overly expansive at\nthis point as evidenced by what he viewed as excessive liquidity in\nfinancial markets, the negative level of real short-term interest\nrates, and the disappointing lack of progress toward lower inflation\nthis year. Given indications of worsening inflationary expectations,\nsuch as the substantial rise in the price of gold, as well as\nprojections of an increase in inflation, a policy that led to a steady\nfederal funds rate in fact implied a further easing of an already\nstimulative monetary policy. In these circumstances, a tightening of\npolicy would not involve any significant risk to the expansion but\nwould foster changes in financial conditions and the outlook for\ninflation that would be more consistent with renewed progress toward\nprice stability in 1994 and later. Declining inflation around the\nworld and a stronger trend of productivity growth in the United\nStates, among other factors, were providing a favorable environment\nfor further disinflation, but those developments needed to be\nsupported and validated by appropriate monetary policy action.\n\nAt this meeting, the Committee reviewed its practices with\nregard to the release of information to the public. This review was\nundertaken in response to media reports of the purported results of\nthe May meeting before the Committee had made public any information\nabout that meeting. In its discussion, the Committee reaffirmed its\nlong-standing rules governing the confidentiality of FOMC information,\nincluding the schedule that calls for releasing the minutes of a\nCommittee meeting, along with an explanation of the Committee's\ndecisions, a few days after the next meeting. These rules are\ndesigned to safeguard the Committee's flexibility to make needed\nadjustments to policy and also to provide adequate time to prepare a\nfull report of the context and rationale for its decisions. Committee\nmembers emphasized the potential for inadvertent leaks of information\nin the course of general conversations with representatives of the\nnews media or others concerning the members' views about economic\ndevelopments or monetary policy. The members agreed that particular\ncare needed to be taken for some period before and after each of its\nmeetings.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, August 17, 1993.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:25 p.m. on Wednesday, July 7,\n1993.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
