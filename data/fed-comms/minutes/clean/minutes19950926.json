Cox, Hetzel, Judd, and McNees, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Richmond, San Francisco, and Boston respectively\n\nMs. Meulendyke, Adviser, Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on August 22, 1995, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets since the August meeting.\nThere were no transactions in these markets for the System Account\nduring this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period August 22,\n1995, through September 25, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the current\nquarter. Consumer spending appeared to be advancing somewhat further\nafter a sizable gain in the second quarter; housing demand had\nstrengthened in response to earlier reductions in mortgage rates; and\nbusiness investment remained on a solid uptrend. Although business\nefforts to pare inventories apparently were still in progress, both\nproduction and employment were advancing moderately. After having\nincreased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer\nand producer prices had risen more slowly in recent months.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in\nAugust after changing little in July. Much of the rise reflected a\npickup in hiring in the services industry, notably in business\nservices. Manufacturing payrolls were up modestly in August; the gain\nfollowed substantial declines in the previous four months.\nConstruction employment changed little on balance over July and\nAugust, with only small changes being posted each month. The civilian\nunemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August, remaining in\nthe narrow range that had prevailed since late 1994.\n\nIndustrial production jumped in August to a level moderately\nabove its average for the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose\nsharply, posting its first increase since January; a surge in the\nproduction of motor vehicles and parts accounted for some of the\nadvance, but the output of non-automotive consumer goods in August\nmore than reversed a sizable drop in July, and the production of\nbusiness equipment recorded another robust gain. A steep rise in\nelectricity generation associated with unusually hot weather over much\nof the country more than offset a decline in mining production. Total\nutilization of industrial capacity moved higher in August but remained\nbelow the average rate for the first quarter.\n\nRetail sales were up slightly on balance over July and August\nafter rising appreciably in the previous two months. Abstracting from\nthe volatile sales of motor vehicles during this period, spending on\ngoods changed little on balance over the two months, as increased\noutlays for durable goods were offset by flagging purchases of\napparel. Spending on services rose in July (latest data available) owing in part to elevated demand for energy-related services during\nthat month's unseasonably warm weather. Housing market activity\nincreased further in July and August. Sales of both new and existing\nhomes in July (latest data) reached their highest levels in more than\na year, and housing starts edged up in August after a substantial rise\nin July.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods fell appreciably in\nJuly after having risen rapidly over the first half of the year, and\nsales of heavy trucks also were down substantially. New orders for\nnondefense capital goods declined steeply in July: however, the still-large backlog of outstanding orders, coupled with the favorable\neffects on the user cost of capital of lower interest rates and higher\nequity prices this year, pointed to further substantial expansion of\nspending on business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential\nconstruction posted another sizable gain in July. Outlays for office,\nindustrial, and institutional structures registered healthy increases,\nbut other commercial building activity was unchanged.\n\nBusiness inventory accumulation slowed in June and July from\na very rapid rate earlier in the year: stockpiling continued at a\nbrisk pace in manufacturing and wholesale trade, but retail stocks\nwere drawn down. In manufacturing, stocks increased in July at about\nthe average rate seen in the second quarter; however, the stocks-to-shipments ratio rose somewhat, reflecting in part a reduction in\nshipments that might have been exaggerated by difficulties of seasonal\nadjustment. Wholesale inventories also advanced at about the second-quarter pace, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector moved\nup to the upper end of its range for recent years. At the retail\nlevel, reduced stocks at automotive dealers accounted for much of the\nJuly decline in inventories; the ratio of inventories to sales edged\nlower but remained near the middle of the range for recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened slightly in July from its average rate in the second quarter.\nThe value of both exports and imports decreased. For exports, the\nlargest decline was in aircraft and automotive products. The decrease\nin imports was concentrated in automotive products and gold.\nAvailable indicators of economic activity suggested that expansion was\ncontinuing in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the\nthird quarter and that the average rate of growth remained near the\nsubdued pace of the first half of the year.\n\nAs in other recent months, consumer prices rose more slowly\nin August than in the early months of the year. Sizable declines in\nenergy prices were a contributing factor, but price increases also had\nmoderated for nonfood, non-energy items; the moderation largely\nreflected a downturn in automobile finance charges and used-car prices\nalong with smaller increases in airline fares. For the twelve months\nending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices rose by the same amount\nas in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of\nfinished goods edged lower in August after being unchanged in July.\nAlthough declines in prices of finished energy goods held down the\noverall index in both months, prices of finished goods other than food\nand energy rose more slowly than in the early months of the year; for\nthe twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices of\nfinished goods increased slightly more than in the comparable year-earlier period.\n\nAt its meeting on August 22, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with more moderate growth of M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and the\nfederal funds rate generally were in line with expectations, with the\nfunds rate averaging close to 5-3/4 percent. Other market interest\nrates fell appreciably over much of the period, though these declines\nwere partially reversed near the end of the period. Further evidence\nof subdued price pressures, indications that the rebound in growth of\nGDP would be modest, and increasing confidence that significant\nreductions in federal deficits might be in train contributed to the\ndrop in rates. The lower interest rates, optimistic assessments of\ncorporate earnings, and the brisk pace of merger announcements and\nshare buybacks helped lift major indexes of equity prices to new\nrecord levels during the period, though they ended the period below\nthose highs.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined over the\nintermeeting period. The dollar moved higher over most of the period,\npartly in response to monetary easing actions in Germany, which were\nquickly followed by similar steps in other European countries, and in\nJapan. The policy easing in Japan was accompanied, inter alia, by\nstatements by U.S. and Japanese officials that they would welcome a\nweaker yen. The dollar reversed course late in the intermeeting\nperiod, however, following the announcement of a new Japanese fiscal\npackage and emerging uncertainties about the prospects for European\nmonetary union. On balance over the period, the dollar moved lower\nagainst most European currencies while appreciating significantly\nfurther against the yen.\n\nAfter further strong expansion in August, M2 and M3 appeared\nto be growing at a somewhat more moderate rate in September. The\nstill-brisk demand for M2 assets was associated with the lower market\ninterest rates now prevailing and the related decline in the opportunity costs associated with holding these assets. The relatively\nrobust growth of M3 reflected inflows to institution-only money market\nfunds as well as bank acquisitions of wholesale funds to meet loan\ndemand. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat\nbelow the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate\nappreciably above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had\ngrown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent\nmonths.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\ngrowth in economic activity over the forecast horizon would be higher\nthan the weak pace of the second quarter. The process of bringing\ninventories into better alignment with sales was well under way, and\nthe favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally\nin the debt and equity markets would tend to support moderate\nexpansion of final sales. Consumer spending was expected to grow at a\npace generally in line with incomes; the favorable effects on spending\nof higher prices for financial assets held by households would be\noffset to a degree in this forecast by less robust labor market\nconditions and the difficulties that growing numbers of households\nwould encounter in servicing their enlarged debts. Homebuilding was\nexpected to be somewhat stronger in response to the earlier decline in\nmortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability.\nIn anticipation of slower growth of sales and profits, business\ninvestment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from\nthe very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of\ncapital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain\nappreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up\nin response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major\ntrading partners. A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the fiscal\noutlook, but the staff continued to build a considerable degree of\nfiscal restraint into its forecast. In the staff's judgment, the\nprospects for some further easing of pressures on labor and other\nresources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate\nsignificantly from recent trends.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the information\navailable since the August meeting had tended to confirm earlier\nindications of a pickup in the expansion after a period of sluggish\ngrowth during the spring. The economy did not display uniform\nstrength across industries or regions, but it appeared on balance to\nhave considerable and desirable expansionary momentum. Growth at a\npace averaging close to, or perhaps slightly below, the economy's\npotential was viewed as the most likely prospect for the year ahead.\nThe outlook for economic activity remained subject to a variety of\nuncertainties, including the still unsettled course of the federal\nbudget, and many members saw the risks of a shortfall from expectations as slightly greater than those of significantly faster growth.\nWith regard to inflation, the slower increases in key measures of\nconsumer and producer prices since earlier in the year were a welcome\ndevelopment, and a number of members commented that inflation was\nlikely to remain contained, given likely developments. Many expressed\nconcern, however, that significant further progress toward achieving\nstable prices might not be made over the next year or two.\n\nIn keeping with indicators of nationwide economic performance, anecdotal and other reports on regional activity suggested\nsomewhat uneven business conditions in different parts of the country,\nbut collectively the reports pointed to moderate overall growth.\nBusiness activity in most regions had tended to improve or to remain\nfirm during the summer months, though declining growth or very\nsluggish activity characterized some areas. The level of business\nconfidence generally appeared to have stayed high, but several members\nindicated that they sensed from their contacts that business\nexpectations were somewhat fragile and vulnerable to adverse\ndevelopments.\n\nIn their discussion of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members generally viewed comparatively moderate growth in\nconsumer spending as a likely prospect over the forecast period.\nAfter recording sizable gains in late spring, retail sales had been\nwell maintained in recent months, with some strengthening in the motor\nvehicles sector in August apparently carrying over to September.\nFavorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included the\nincreases that had occurred in the value of financial assets and the\ndemand for household appliances and other durables that was expected\nto be generated by stronger housing activity. On the other hand,\noverall gains in consumer spending were likely to be restrained by\ncyclically waning pent-up demands for consumer durables, especially\nmotor vehicles; still widespread concerns about job security\nassociated with ongoing business restructuring and downsizing\nactivities; and higher consumer debt loads.\n\nHousing demand was continuing to respond to more attractive\nmortgage rates, as evidenced by nationwide data and anecdotal reports\nfrom many parts of the country. Increases in construction activity\nwere lagging the improvement in housing demand and had been limited\nthus far, but considerable strength in homebuilding activity could be\nexpected over the next several months. The extent of further lagged\nresponses to reduced mortgage rates could not be foreseen with any\ndegree of certainty, and in any event housing demand would depend on\nbroad economic developments such as trends in employment and income.\nHousing activity appeared to have weakened over recent months in one\nmajor market where economic conditions were described as relatively\nsluggish. In many other areas, however, persons in the real estate\nindustry were reported to be optimistic about the outlook for housing.\n\nBusiness fixed investment remained a strongly positive factor\nin the economy and was expected to provide further impetus to growth\nover the next several quarters. The contribution of this sector could\nbe expected to lessen, however, as capital spending was adjusted to\nexpectations of a maturing expansion characterized by the emergence of\nslower growth in final demand and business profits. In particular,\nthe outsized growth in business spending for equipment did not appear\nto be sustainable under foreseeable economic conditions.\n\nDiminished growth in inventories still seemed to be retarding\nthe expansion in overall business activity, as evidenced in part by\ncontinuing reports of efforts by various business firms to bring their\ninventories into better balance with sales. Nonetheless, such\nadjustments now appeared to have been largely completed, or were\nexpected to be completed over the months immediately ahead, so that\ninventory investment could be expected to have little effect on the\ncourse of the economy during 1996. It was noted, however, that\nprojections of inventory behavior were subject to a high degree of\nuncertainty.\n\nA number of members commented that fiscal policy developments\nconstituted a major uncertainty in the outlook for economic activity.\nWhile measures incorporating substantial reductions in spending from\ncurrent trends were widely expected to be enacted into law, it was not\npossible to predict the outcome of the continuing debate on the\nfederal budget in the Congress and the Administration. Further\ncomplicating any efforts to assess the potential damping influence of\nprospective fiscal policy were uncertainties regarding the time frame\nduring which the new expenditure and tax measures would be put in\nplace--including the extent to which they would be implemented over\nthe year ahead--and the effects of the new fiscal measures on economic\nincentives and financial markets. Favorable business and financial\nmarket reactions would tend to mitigate, at least for a time, the\nrestraining effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand. On the\nother hand, if the deficit reduction measures that eventually were\nenacted were to fall substantially short of current expectations,\nthere would be adverse repercussions in financial markets and possibly\non business confidence.\n\nThe nation's trade deficit was expected to diminish somewhat\nover the next several quarters and in the process to exert less\nrestraint on domestic economic activity. The better trade performance\nwas projected to result from a number of factors, including the\nimproved competitive position of U.S. producers and the lagged effects\nof earlier declines in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange\nmarkets. It also was associated with forecasts of somewhat stronger\ngrowth in economic activity abroad than in the United States. While\nthere were continuing anecdotal reports of expanding export markets,\nsome members expressed reservations about the extent to which the\neconomies of major foreign trading partners would strengthen over the\nforecast period and the related prospects for growth of foreign demand\nfor U.S. goods and services.\n\nViews on the outlook for inflation centered on forecasts of\nlittle change or some slight decline in the rate of increase in\nconsumer prices over the year ahead. The appreciable moderation in\ninflation in recent months had checked the deteriorating trend that\nseemed to be emerging during the early months of the year, but the\nmembers generally believed that recent developments did not point to a\nsignificant further decline in inflation. Pressures on producer\nresources had eased since the early part of the year, but the labor\nmarket remained tight and capacity utilization was still above its\nhistorical average. In this connection, a few members commented that\ncurrent forecasts were subject to a range of error that included a\nrisk of some intensification of inflationary pressures.\n\nOne uncertainty bearing on the outlook for inflation was the\nextent to which potentially greater pressures on labor costs would be\ntranslated into higher prices. Increases in labor expenses had been\nheld down by markedly reduced advances in the costs of benefits,\nnotably medical benefits. The economies from the latter source might\nwell lessen over coming quarters as the most easily implemented\nreductions in the costs of providing medical care were achieved.\nMoreover, the rise in worker compensation had been unusually\nrestrained in recent years in relation to the strong demand for\nworkers, evidently reflecting the effects of worker concerns about job\nsecurity in a period of business restructurings and downsizings, but\ncontinued strength in the demand for labor might be expected to induce\nmore rapid increases in labor compensation over time. Some members\ncommented, however, that the underlying factors affecting employment\ncosts were not likely to change greatly over the forecast period. In\naddition, the prospect that intense competitive pressures would\npersist in many markets under projected economic conditions suggested\nthat business firms would continue to find it very difficult to pass\non rising costs through higher prices. It also was possible that the\nrates of capacity utilization and employment associated with a steady\nrate of inflation had changed in the direction of providing the\neconomy greater leeway to operate at a somewhat higher level without\ngenerating more inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions. The expansion\nseemed for now to have a desirable and sustainable momentum that did\nnot call for any change in policy. Furthermore, the outlook remained\nclouded by the uncertainties stemming from the ongoing federal budget\ndebate. In any event, the Committee would need to remain alert to a\nbroader range of developments that might warrant a policy change at\nsome point. In this connection, several members expressed the opinion\nthat policy might have to be eased eventually in light of the downside\nrisks that they saw in the economy and a current policy stance that\nthey viewed as slightly restrictive. However, the current performance\nof the economy suggested that the timing of an easing action was not\nan immediate concern. Other members who preferred an unchanged policy\nplaced more emphasis on current forecasts of little or no progress in\nreducing inflation from recent levels. They thought it would be\npremature to ease policy without greater assurance that inflation had\nbeen contained in the current cyclical expansion and that prospects\nfor significant further progress toward the long-run objective of\nprice level stability had improved. Indeed, the direction of the next\npolicy move was not clear in the view of some members, and they\nbelieved that any easing should await a firm indication that the\noutlook for economic activity was becoming less favorable or that\ninflation was decreasing more rapidly than expected.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, the members all endorsed a proposal to retain an\nintermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any\nbias concerning the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes.\nAt this juncture, there was no specific reason to anticipate\ndevelopments that would call for an adjustment to policy during the\nweeks ahead. While a change in policy certainly could not be ruled\nout, the reasons for the change likely would involve sensitive issues\nthat would warrant Committee consultation regardless of the\nintermeeting instruction.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated a preference for a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\ngrowth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year at a pace near that\nexperienced in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate\nin the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment\nincreased considerably in August after essentially no\ngrowth in July; the civilian unemployment rate edged\ndown to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production\nposted a large increase in August to a level moderately\nabove the average of the second quarter. Total nominal\nretail sales rose slightly on balance over July and\nAugust after registering appreciable gains in the prior\ntwo months. Housing starts were up a little in August\nafter increasing sharply in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods have softened but still point to\nsubstantial expansion of spending on business equipment\nover coming months; nonresidential construction has\nbeen strong of late. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade\nin goods and services widened slightly in July from its\naverage rate in the second quarter. After increasing\nat elevated rates in the early part of the year,\nconsumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in\nrecent months.\n\nMarket interest rates have fallen somewhat since\nthe Committee meeting on August 22. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has\ndeclined over the intermeeting period, with most of the\ndecline occurring over the past several days.\n\nM2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases\nin August but growth of those aggregates appears to\nhave moderated somewhat in September. For the year\nthrough August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below\nthe upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a\nrate appreciably above its range. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has grown at a rate around the\nmidpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established\non January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5\npercent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also\nretained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear that it had set for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range\nfor M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to\ntake account of changing intermediation patterns. For\n1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis\nthe same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary\naggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of\nthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of\nthe year near the pace of recent months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nDiscussion of Proposed Legislation\n\nAt this meeting, the Committee discussed a bill, titled the\n\"Economic Growth and Price Stability Act of 1995,\" that recently had\nbeen introduced in the United States Senate. The bill would make\nprice stability the primary long-run policy goal of the Federal\nReserve and require the Federal Reserve to establish a numerical\ndefinition of price stability and to implement a policy that would\neffectively promote such stability over time. It would repeal the\nFull Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the \"Humphrey-Hawkins\nAct\") and certain related provisions in the Employment Act of 1946 and\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Federal Reserve had not yet\nbeen asked its views of the bill, but testimony was likely at some\npoint and a preliminary discussion would help to identify important\nissues.\n\nThe members had not had time to review the bill in detail or\nto consider fully all its implications. Nonetheless, their initial\nreaction was favorable in regard to the overall thrust of the bill's\nmonetary policy provisions. These would make clear that price\nstability was the primary long-run objective of monetary policy and\nwould restructure the monetary policy reporting requirements to permit\nthe Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities more\neffectively. Many members felt that in the context of seeking and\nmaintaining price stability, monetary policy should have the\nflexibility to react to short-run fluctuations in output and\nemployment, and they believed the bill would be improved if its intent\nin this regard were clarified. A few members expressed strong\nreservations about the part of the bill that would delete the\nemployment objectives set forth in the Employment Act of 1946.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Wednesday. November 15, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:20 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
