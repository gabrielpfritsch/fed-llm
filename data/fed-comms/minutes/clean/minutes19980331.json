There\nwere no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during\nthis period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period from\nFebruary 4, 1998, through March 30, 1998. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomy continued to expand rapidly during the early months of 1998.\nApparently, strong growth in private domestic spending for consump-\ntion, housing, and business equipment more than offset weakness in net\nexports and a slight moderation in inventory investment. Total\nemployment continued to rise rapidly, but industrial production\nincreased at a considerably slower pace. Despite indications of\npersisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor\nmarkets, price inflation abated further, primarily as a consequence of\nlarge declines in energy prices.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in January\nand February. Growth in construction jobs was particularly strong,\napparently reflecting in part the unseasonably warm weather across\nmuch of the country and the need to repair damage caused by ice storms\nand heavy rains. In addition, service industries continued to post\nvery large employment gains. By contrast, manufacturing payrolls\ncontracted slightly in February after a sizable increase in January.\nThe civilian unemployment rate edged down to 4.6 percent in February,\nequaling its low for the current economic expansion.\n\nIndustrial production edged up on balance in January and\nFebruary after having increased rapidly in the second half of 1997.\nPart of the deceleration stemmed from the depressing effect of\nunusually warm winter weather on the provision of heating services by\nutilities. The growth of manufacturing production also slowed\nconsiderably as a result of downward adjustments to assemblies of\nmotor vehicles and, more generally, weakness in the output of business\nequipment. With investment in new manufacturing facilities still\nbrisk and manufacturing output posting only a small advance in the\nJanuary-February period, the factory operating rate eased a little.\n\nConsumers stepped up their spending in the early months of\nthe year; sentiment remained buoyant in the context of continued\nstrong growth in disposable income and further gains in household\nwealth. Particularly large increases were recorded in expenditures on\ndurable goods, apparel, and general merchandise. Housing demand also\nstrengthened, with sales of existing homes reaching a record high in\nFebruary and sales of new homes in January (latest data) almost\nequaling the previous record. Both housing starts and building\npermits remained on an upward trend.\n\nBusiness fixed investment seemed to have rebounded from a\nsmall decline in the fourth quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital\ngoods, notably of computing equipment whose prices continued to fall\nsharply, strengthened substantially in January and February. By\ncontrast, expenditures on transportation equipment were sluggish.\nDespite further declines in vacancy rates and rising real estate\nprices, business spending on nonresidential construction also seemed\nto have been lackluster, with such activity not having changed much\nsince last summer.\n\nThe pace of business inventory accumulation slowed sharply in\nJanuary from the fourth-quarter rate. Some of the slowdown reflected\na reduction in motor vehicle stocks; the remainder was largely\nassociated with a drop in inventories of nondurable goods at the\nwholesale level. Inventory-sales ratios for most manufacturing and\ntrade categories were within the ranges experienced over the past\nyear.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in January from its average monthly level for\nthe fourth quarter. The value of exports declined considerably,\npartly as a result of reduced exports to Asia, but the value of\nimports changed little. The decrease in exports was mainly in\ncivilian aircraft and other capital goods. The available information\nindicated that the pace of economic expansion picked up in Europe\nafter having slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter and was still\nstrong on balance in Canada. Economic activity remained weak in Japan\nand decelerated sharply in Asian countries that had been the focus of\nfinancial turmoil.\n\nConsumer prices were little changed on balance in January and\nFebruary, as substantial declines in energy prices largely offset\nincreases elsewhere. Excluding food and energy items, consumer price\ninflation picked up somewhat in the first two months of the year from\nthe pace of the second half of 1997; on a year-over-year basis,\nhowever, the increase in consumer prices during the twelve months\nended in February was slightly smaller than that in the year-earlier\nperiod. At the producer level, falling prices for finished energy\ngoods in January and February pulled down the index of prices for all\nfinished items; excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged on\nbalance over the two months. Over the twelve months ended in\nFebruary, producer price inflation was negligible. Tight labor\nmarkets appeared to be putting some upward pressure on labor\ncompensation, but the pickup was limited. The change in average\nhourly earnings over the twelve months ended in February was only\nslightly larger than the increase over the year-earlier period.\n\nWith economic growth still solid and inflation subdued, the\nCommittee at its meeting on February 3-4, 1998, had adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat would be consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about\n5-1/2 percent. The substantial uncertainties about the future\nstrength of economic activity and inflation suggested that the next\nchange in policy could be in either direction, and the Committee also\nhad agreed that the directive should not contain a presumption about\nthe direction of any change in the stance of policy during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve market conditions associated with\nthis directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation\nin the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations throughout the intermeeting period\nwere directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with\nthe intended average for the federal funds rate of around 5-1/2\npercent, and the rate fluctuated in a narrow range around that level.\nBy contrast, interest rates in other domestic financial markets\ngenerally rose somewhat on balance over the period in response to\nincoming information that suggested aggregate private demand remained\nrobust. Despite the rise in rates and some erosion in the outlook for\nnear-term corporate profits, share prices in U.S. equity markets moved\nup substantially further.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated somewhat\non balance over the intermeeting period in relation to the currencies\nof the other major industrial countries. Against a background of\nweakening growth in Japan and continued uncertainty about the\nprospects for fiscal stimulus in that country, the dollar rose\nconsiderably against the yen. The dollar changed little against the\nmark and other continental European currencies but declined against\nthe Canadian dollar and the British pound. The dollar also\ndepreciated significantly relative to the currencies of several\nemerging market economies in Asia, reflecting market assessments that\nprogress had been made in reforming economic policies and financial\nand commercial practices in most of those countries.\n\nThe available information for February and part of March\nindicated that M2 and M3 expanded more rapidly than the Committee had\nanticipated at the time of its February meeting. On a quarterly\naverage basis, growth of both monetary aggregates picked up somewhat\nin the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter.\nThe increased demand for M2 was perhaps associated in part with the\nreduced attractiveness of longer-term fixed rate market assets, whose\nyields had declined significantly relative to the returns on liquid\ninvestment components of M2. In addition, households might have been\ntrying to rebalance asset portfolios that had become more heavily\nweighted in equities as a result of the run-up in stock prices. The\npickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in bank issuance of large time\ndeposits to finance strong demands for loans by businesses and\nhouseholds. The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also\nstrengthened over recent months in response to heavy private demands\nfor credit.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that\nthe expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the\nnext few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. The staff analysis\nsuggested that the surge in household net worth over the past several\nyears would help to support sizable, though gradually diminishing,\ngains in consumer spending; favorable cash flow affordability would\nunderpin housing demand at a relatively high level; and substantial\nincreases in capital spending would persist until slower growth in\nbusiness sales and weaker profits began to have a restraining effect\nin 1999. Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged\neffects of the considerable rise that had occurred in the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar were expected to exert substantial\nrestraint on the demand for U.S. exports over the projection period\nand to increase the pressures on domestic producers that face import\ncompetition. An anticipated slowdown in the pace of inventory\naccumulation also would restrain domestic production as stocks were\nbrought into balance with the expected lower trajectory for sales.\nAlthough pressures on production resources would abate to a degree as\noutput growth slowed, inflation was expected to increase somewhat in\nresponse to persisting tightness in labor markets and a diminishing\ndrag from non-oil import prices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\ndevelopments, members commented on the persistence of unusually\nfavorable economic conditions, characterized by strong growth and low\ninflation, but a number questioned how long these conditions might\nlast without a policy adjustment. Domestic demand was exceeding\nexpectations and was likely to continue to increase rapidly for some\ntime, supported by accommodative conditions in key segments of\nfinancial markets. Developments in foreign trade were moderating\ndemands on domestic resources; but with domestic spending strong,\nmembers were becoming more concerned that those developments might not\nexert enough restraint on aggregate demand to slow the expansion to a\nsustainable pace in line with the growth of the economy's potential.\nDespite tightening labor markets, inflation prospects remained quite\nfavorable for a while as a number of factors--some temporary--helped\nto damp near-term pressures on prices. Nonetheless, in the absence of\nsome slowing in the expansion, labor compensation probably would\ncontinue to accelerate and increasingly outpace productivity, adding\nto pressures on prices.\n\nIn their review of the outlook for spending in key sectors of\nthe domestic economy, members saw little reason to anticipate\nsubstantial slowing in the growth of consumer or business expenditures\nin coming quarters, and they also expected housing activity to be\nmaintained at a relatively high level. The recent further increases\nin equity prices from already high levels played an important role in\nthe assessments of several members. The stock market's rise was\nviewed as somewhat puzzling, given indications of some slowing in the\ngrowth of profits and the potential for earnings disappointments as\nthe expansion in spending moderated and profit margins narrowed in the\ncontext of more rapid labor cost increases. So long as a high degree\nof optimism in the stock market persisted, however, the elevated level\nof financial wealth and the low cost of capital should continue to\nboost spending. Consumer expenditures, especially for durable goods,\nhad risen sharply thus far this year, and the factors that had fueled\nthat expansion were still unusually positive. They included large\nincreases in employment and personal incomes, the continuing uptrend\nin financial wealth relative to disposable income, and, in these\ncircumstances, the persistence of a very high level of consumer\nconfidence. Attractive financing conditions and favorable business\nconfidence also were expected to support substantial further growth in\nbusiness investment, especially in \"high-tech\" equipment that was\ncharacterized by rapid product improvement and falling prices.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures, notably in office and other\ncommercial markets, seemed likely to strengthen somewhat in response\nto reduced vacancy rates and sizable increases in rents in many areas;\nindeed, several members again reported indications of speculative\nnonresidential construction in some parts of the country. Residential\nconstruction was expected to be maintained at a high level, though\nsingle-family starts might soften over the next few months after a\nsurge that appeared to have been related to relatively favorable\nweather conditions during the winter. With mortgage rates at their\nrecent reduced levels and incomes continuing to rise, the cash flow\naffordability of home ownership was exceptionally favorable.\n\nDevelopments in two areas of expenditures were thought likely\nto exert some restraining effect on the overall expansion in economic\nactivity over coming quarters. One was business inventory accumula-\ntion, which had exceeded the robust growth in final sales in 1997 and\nprobably would moderate this year as business firms sought to restrain\nthe buildup in their inventories to keep them in better alignment with\nthe expected moderation of gains in sales.\n\nThe second, foreign trade developments, also was likely to\nhave a damping influence on the domestic economy. While the lagged\neffects of the dollar's appreciation and economic conditions in key\nU.S. trading partners around the world were important factors in this\nassessment, members focused in this discussion on the effects of\nweakness in several Asian economies. Conditions in Japan and in key\nemerging market economies in Asia were still quite fragile, adjust-\nments on the real side of the economy were just beginning to be felt\nin some cases, and outcomes for economic growth and exchange rates\nwere still very much in doubt. Nonetheless, some progress had been\nmade in putting recovery programs together and financial markets had\nseemed to stabilize in several countries. Anecdotal reports of\nadverse repercussions on individual U.S. firms from the Asian\nfinancial turmoil had increased somewhat since the Committee's\nprevious meeting, but the direct overall impact on the U.S. economy\nwas still limited. Indeed, developments in Asia also appeared to have\nhad positive, albeit indirect, effects on domestic demand and prices\nin the near term by exerting some downward pressure on U.S. interest\nrates and world oil prices. Prices in the United States of a number\nof Asian goods and of domestic products competing with those goods had\nbeen lowered. Over time, conditions in key Asian economies were\nthought likely to have a more pronounced retarding effect on the U.S.\neconomy. While the eventual dimensions of that effect remained\nuncertain, a number of members commented that, on the basis of\ndevelopments to date, they might turn out to be less negative than had\nbeen expected earlier, or at least that some \"worst case\" outcomes\nseemed less likely.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, members observed\nthat price inflation remained quite low--in fact, it was still\ndeclining by some measures--and there was little evidence of any\npotential acceleration in current price data or in anecdotal reports\nfrom around the country. Nonetheless, as they had at previous\nmeetings, members expressed particular concern about the outlook for\nprices in the absence of appreciable slowing in the growth of\naggregate demand, which appeared to be adding to pressures on labor\nresources. Anecdotal reports from across the nation continued to\nsuggest exceptionally tight labor markets and growing indications of\nsomewhat faster increases in labor compensation. To date, unit labor\ncosts had been contained by large capital investments and other\ninitiatives that had raised the productivity of labor. But additional\nimprovements in productivity growth could not be counted on to offset\nfurther increases in the rate of growth of labor compensation, which\nwere more likely to occur especially if labor markets were to tighten\nfurther. Moreover, the effects of a number of special factors that\nhad tended to limit cost pressures and price inflation in recent years\nwere not likely to persist; these included the declines in world oil\nprices, the subdued increases in the costs of health benefits, and the\nlagged effects of the appreciation of the dollar. To be sure, the\nfactors that had produced the favorable inflation results of recent\nyears were not all well understood, and consequently expectations of\ngreater price pressures had to be tentative. On balance, though any\nupsurge in inflation seemed unlikely in the nearer term, the risk that\ninflation might move higher over the longer run seemed to have\nincreased.\n\nDespite perceptions of a greater risk of rising inflation\nover time, all but one of the members indicated in the Committee's\npolicy discussion that they preferred or could accept a proposal to\nmaintain an unchanged policy stance that also included a shift from\nthe current symmetrical directive to an asymmetrical directive tilted\ntoward restraint. The members agreed that should the strength of the\neconomic expansion and the firming of labor markets persist, policy\ntightening likely would be needed at some point to head off imbalances\nthat over time would undermine the expansion in economic activity.\nMost saw little urgency to tighten policy at this meeting, however.\nThe economy might well continue to accommodate relatively robust\neconomic growth and a high level of resource use for an extended\nperiod without a rise in inflation. Some members noted that price\nincreases would be held down for a while by the effects of the higher\ndollar, which had not worked their way fully through domestic prices.\nMoreover, inflation continued to fall by some measures and inflation\nexpectations still seemed to be adjusting downward toward actual\ninflation; further declines in these expectations would restrain\nincreases in compensation and prices. Members also noted that the\nultimate extent of retarding effects from the financial turmoil in\nAsia was still uncertain, and several cited the possibility of a\ndownward adjustment in the stock market, perhaps in response to\ndisappointing growth in business profits, that could have an adverse\nimpact on business and consumer confidence. In these circumstances, a\npreemptive policy move to head off rising inflation could prove\npremature or perhaps even unwarranted; indeed, in the view of some, a\ntightening move was not inevitable. Moreover, because a policy action\nwas not currently anticipated, some commented that a tightening could\nproduce an outsized and undesirable response in financial markets. On\nbalance, in light of the uncertainties in the outlook and given that a\nvariety of special factors would continue to contain inflation for a\ntime, the Committee could await further developments bearing on the\nstrength of inflationary pressures without incurring a significant\nrisk that disruptive policy actions would be needed later in response\nto an upturn in inflation and inflation expectations.\n\nOne member indicated a strong preference for an immediate\npolicy tightening move, largely on the grounds that under current\nconditions relatively rapid growth in money and credit was not\nconsistent with continued progress toward reducing inflation. A\nnumber of other members also commented that the strength of the\nmonetary aggregates, especially if it should persist, was suggesting\nample liquidity and accommodative financial conditions. In addition,\nsome cited ebullient equity markets and narrow risk spreads in credit\nmarkets as additional evidence that financial conditions were not\nrestraining final demands very much. These were factors that they\nwould weigh in their evaluation of the need for, and timing of, a\npolicy tightening move.\n\nThe members agreed that they should be particularly sensitive\nto developments that might signal rising inflation pressures, and in\nthat regard a shift to an asymmetric directive seemed desirable. Such\na directive would be consistent with the Committee's judgment that the\ninformation that had become available since a symmetric directive was\nlast adopted in February had altered the inflation risks enough to\nmake some tightening a likely prospect in the not too distant future.\nIn that regard several suggested that the need for some policy\ntightening could well materialize in the near future.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in\nreserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds\nrate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias toward the\npossible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds\nrate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal\nfunds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate\nmight be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent\nwith considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over the\nmonths ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMr. Jordan dissented because growth rates of various measures\nof money and credit in the second half of 1997 and the first quarter\nof this year were not consistent in his view with continued progress\nin reducing inflation. Recent price statistics understated the trend\nrates of inflation. The one-time effects of falling oil prices, lower\nfood prices, and recent appreciation of the dollar on foreign-exchange\nmarkets provided only a temporary reduction of inflation. While some\nreacceleration of reported rates of inflation was probably\nunavoidable, sustained rapid money growth would risk even higher\ninflation in future years. The durability of the economic expansion\nwould be jeopardized by price and wage decisions reflecting\nexpectations that the purchasing power of the dollar would decline at\nfaster rates in the future. Once such expectations became imbedded in\nthe economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order\nto reestablish a downward trend of inflation.\n\nInterest rates generally have risen somewhat on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. Share prices in\nU.S. equity markets have moved up substantially further\nover the period. In foreign exchange markets, the value\nof the dollar has increased somewhat over the period in\nrelation to the currencies of other major industrial\nnations, but it has depreciated relative to the\ncurrencies of most emerging market economies in Asia.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 picked up somewhat in the first\nquarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter.\nExpansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also has\nstrengthened over recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in\nFebruary established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured\nfrom the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of\n1998. The range for growth of total domestic non-\nfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and develop-\nments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-\nation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with considerable modera-\ntion in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley,\nMeyer, Mses. Minehan, Phillips, Mr. Poole, and\nMs. Rivlin.\n\nMr. Jordan.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, May 19, 1998.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m."
