Chen and Rosenbaum, Vice\nPresidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland,\nNew York, and Atlanta respectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets during the period March 26\nthrough May 20, 1996. There were no open market transactions in\nforeign currencies for System account during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period March 26\nthrough May 20, 1996. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these\ntransactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had expanded moderately on balance in recent months.\nFinal demand, which had been quite robust early in the year, was\nshowing some signs of slowing in recent data. Consumer spending\nappeared to be growing at a moderate pace; business expenditures on\ndurable equipment had registered further large gains, though new\norders had flattened out; and housing demand seemed to be holding up\nwell despite the increase in mortgage interest rates this year.\nBusiness inventories, most notably in the automotive industry, had\nbeen brought into better alignment with sales, and industrial\nproduction and employment had risen appreciably. Upward pressures on\nfood and energy prices accounted for somewhat larger increases in\nconsumer prices.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in April\nafter rising substantially in the first quarter; part of the slowdown\nresulted from an unwinding of special factors that had boosted job\ngrowth in the first quarter. Payrolls continued to expand in April in\nretail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; and the services\nindustries. In contrast, cmployment in construction fell sharply,\nreversing much of the large first-quarter gain. In manufacturing,\nemployment declined further in April despite the settlement of a major\nstrike in the automotive sector and the return of affected workers to\ntheir jobs. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent.\n\nIndustrial production rebounded in April from an appreciable\ndecline in March. The changes in industrial output over the two-month\nperiod largely reflected fluctuations in motor vehicle assemblies\nassociated with a strike and its subsequent settlement. Manufacturing\nof products other than motor vehicles rose moderately in April on the\nstrength of further large advances in the output of office and\ncomputing equipment and of construction supplies. Utilization of\ntotal industrial capacity, which had varied in recent months in\nconcert with movements in production, climbed in April to a rate\nslightly above that of the fourth quarter of 1995.\n\nRetail sales declined somewhat in April after posting a\nstrong gain in the first quarter. Sales of durable goods, which had\nincreased substantially in the first quarter, retraced part of that\nadvance in April; the drop more than offset a further rise in sales of\nnondurable goods. Housing activity was well sustained in April, with\nthe run-up in mortgage rates that began in February having had little\nperceptible effect to date. Single-family housing starts were up\nconsiderably in April, and sales of new and existing homes remained\nbrisk in March (latest data available).\n\nBusiness inventories declined in March after rising\nappreciably on average over January and February; inventory\naccumulation over the quarter as a whole was of modest proportions, as\nfirms sought to bring stocks into better balance with sales. In\nmanufacturing, inventories changed little in March and the ratio of\nstocks to sales was not far above historical lows. In the wholesale\nsector, inventories declined a little further in March, reflecting a\nreduction in stocks of motor vehicles, and the inventory-sales ratio\nremained near the middle of its range in recent years. Retail\ninventories also declined in March, with cuts in stocks of motor\nvehicles more than accounting for the drop. The inventory-sales ratio\nfor the retail sector was near the low end of its range in recent\nyears.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in\nthe first quarter was substantially larger than in the fourth quarter\nof last year. The value of imports increased sharply in the first\nquarter after declining in the two previous quarters. Moreover,\ngrowth in the value of exports slowed considerably in the first\nquarter from the pace of other recent quarters. Available data\nindicated that the performance of the economies of the major foreign\nindustrial countries was mixed in the first quarter. The recovery in\nJapan was still under way while economic activity in continental\nEurope remained generally weak, with the German economy apparently\nhaving contracted further and the French economy exhibiting signs of\nonly a modest upturn after a fourth-quarter decline. Moderate further\nexpansion in economic activity evidently was occurring in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nRising crude oil and, to a lesser extent, food prices led to\nsomewhat larger increases in consumer and producer price indexes in\nMarch and April. For nonfood, non-energy items, however, consumer\nprices rose only slightly in April after three months of somewhat\nfaster advances; over the twelve months ended in April, this measure\nof consumer inflation increased a little less than the rise over the\ncomparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of\nfinished goods other than food and energy items recorded a third\nstraight small increase in April. Over the twelve months ended in\nApril, this measure of producer prices rose slightly less than over\nthe comparable year-earlier period. Hourly compensation of private\nindustry workers expanded in the first quarter at the average rate for\nall of 1995; the growth was associated with a decline in benefit costs\nand a sharp rise in wages and salaries.\n\nAt its meeting on March 21, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly\nlesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the\nintermeeting period, and the federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4\npercent, the level expected to be associated with that unchanged\npolicy stance. Other short-term market interest rates changed little\nover the period, and because the Committee's decision had been largely\nanticipated in financial markets, longer-term rates also were little\nchanged initially. Over the remainder of the period, however,\nintermediate- and long-term rates came under upward pressure when\nincoming economic data were seen by market participants as pointing to\nstronger growth in output and employment and therefore to a somewhat\ntighter monetary policy stance than previously had been expected.\nDespite the increase in bond yields, most indexes of stock prices rose\non balance over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting\ngenerally favorable first-quarter earnings reports and the improved\neconomic outlook.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the rise of U.S. interest rates\ncontributed to a considerable appreciation of the trade-weighted value\nof the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies. The dollar was\nparticularly strong against the German mark, reflecting incoming data\nthat suggested continued weakness in economic activity in Germany and,\naccordingly, a greater likelihood of further monetary policy easing by\nthe Bundesbank. The dollar rose less against the yen, partly owing to\ninformation indicating a strengthening of the economic recovery in\nJapan and heightened market expectations of a near-term tightening of\nmonetary policy by the Bank of Japan.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April after\nhaving recorded sizable increases earlier in the year. Weakness in\ndemand deposits after unusually rapid first-quarter expansion and\nsluggishness in currency demand were factors in the slowdown. In\naddition, the rise in market interest rates in recent months, which\nhad increased the opportunity costs of holding retail deposits, likely\nhad a restraining effect on these deposits. For the year through\nApril, both aggregates grew at rates somewhat above the upper bounds\nof their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic\nnonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over recent months, and\nthis aggregate stayed near the middle of its monitoring range for the\nyear.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy would remain generally around its estimated potential.\nConsumer spending was expected to grow in line with disposable income;\nthe favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and\nthe still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh\npersisting consumer concerns about job security and the influence of\nalready-high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was projected to\ndecline a little in response to the recent backup in residential\nmortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level because of\ngenerally supportive employment and income conditions and the still-\nfavorable cash-flow affordability of homeownership. Business spending\non equipment and structures was expected to grow less rapidly in light\nof the projected moderate growth of sales and profits and the lower\nrate of utilization of production capacity now prevailing. The\nexternal sector was projected to exert a small restraining influence\non economic activity over the projection period, even though an\nanticipated firming of economic activity abroad would bolster demand\nfor U.S. exports. Little additional fiscal contraction was\nanticipated over the projection period. Inflation recently had been\nlifted by adverse developments in the energy market and was projected\nto remain above the levels of recent years, given the high level of\nresource utilization and the effects of tight grain supplies on food\nprices. Further risks of inflationary pressure were associated with a\npossible elevation of the federal minimum wage.\n\nIn their discussion of current and prospective economic\nconditions, members commented that the economy had been stronger this\nyear than they had anticipated and appeared to be growing at a quite\nrobust pace. However, they generally expected the expansion to slow,\nkeeping the economy close to its potential. Views differed to some\nextent with regard to the risks surrounding such an outlook. Some saw\nthose risks as fairly evenly balanced, given prospective restraint\nfrom the rise in bond yields and the foreign exchange value of the\ndollar since early this year. Others expressed concern that economic\ngrowth might continue at a pace that could increase pressures on\nresources, with adverse implications for inflation in an economy\nalready operating in the neighborhood of its estimated long-term\npotential. Moreover, faster increases in energy and food prices could\ncontribute to higher overall inflation, both directly and by boosting\ninflationary expectations, and the proposed increase in the minimum\nwage would add to cost pressures if it were enacted into law.\nNonetheless, while the chances of a pickup in inflation later had\nrisen to some extent, a number of members emphasized that no firm\nevidence had surfaced thus far to signal that labor compensation was\nincreasing at a faster rate or that core inflation was worsening, and\neven the early signs of increased pressures on costs and prices were\nmixed. The last few years had witnessed significantly lower cost\npressures and more subdued inflation than typically would have been\nexperienced in earlier years with similar rates of resource\nutilization, but whether this favorable outcome would persist was an\nopen question.\n\nMembers observed that the stronger-than-expected performance\nof the economy thus far this year reflected relatively rapid growth in\nfinal demand. Favorable financial conditions, notably the relatively\nlow interest rates of the latter part of 1995 and early 1996 and\nincreases in wealth stemming from sizable advances in stock market\nprices, evidently were undergirding the expansion. Indications of\nimproving or continuing high levels of economic activity were\nwidespread across the nation according to recent anecdotal reports and\nregional data, though agricultural conditions in many areas were cited\nas a significant exception. While the economy appeared to have solid\nand balanced momentum that pointed to sustained growth, a number of\nfactors were seen as likely to foster more moderate expansion\nbeginning in the second half of the year. These included the effects\nof higher intermediate- and long-term interest rates on interest-\nsensitive sectors of the economy such as housing, consumer durables,\nand business fixed investment. The appreciation of the dollar over\nthe past year and near-term moderation in federal government spending\nalso were expected to exert some restraint on economic activity over\nthe forecast horizon. Some members also questioned the sustainability\nof the performance of the stock market; a correction in this market\nwould help to restrain aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the continued\nstrength in economic activity raised questions about whether these\ndevelopments would damp demand sufficiently to keep resource\nutilization at sustainable levels.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was believed likely to remain a\nsource of considerable strength in the expansion, though growth in\nthis sector of the economy also was expected to moderate from the\nelevated pace thus far this year. The desire of many business firms\nand other users of capital equipment to take advantage of new, more\neffective, and less expensive computer and other technologies and more\ngenerally to add further to capital in an effort to reduce costs in\nhighly competitive markets would continue to underpin investment\nspending. In addition, equity and other financing remained available\non relatively attractive terms. On the other hand, the rise in\nbusiness investment in recent years had brought capital stocks into\nmore acceptable alignment with expected sales, damping the need for\nfurther sizable additions.\n\nBusiness firms appeared to have completed, or nearly\ncompleted, their efforts to bring inventories into better balance with\nsales, including the rebuilding of motor vehicle stocks after the\nstrike at a major manufacturer was settled in March. On the basis of\nrecent experience, subdued growth in inventories could be anticipated\nin the context of the projected expansion of overall economic activity\nat a pace near the economy's long-run potential. It was suggested,\nhowever, that such an expectation implied relatively restrained\ninventory investment in comparison with past cyclical patterns.\nAccordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with\nconcomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for housing, the rise in mortgage\nrates in the past few months could be expected to retard residential\nconstruction activity to some extent. Thus far. however, increased\ninterest costs did not appear to have had any perceptible effects on\nhousing sales or construction. Indeed, the housing sector was\ncontinuing to display a good deal of strength in many parts of the\ncountry. Some members observed that the appreciable momentum in\nhousing activity reflected strength in the underlying fundamentals,\nincluding continued affordability, that seemed likely to sustain a\nhigh level of housing construction for a considerable period of time\ndespite somewhat higher mortgage rates.\n\nIn the area of fiscal policy, legislative agreement had not\nyet been reached on how to implement the objective of a balanced\nfederal budget over time, but decisions covering the nearer term\nimplied continued budget restraint. On the foreign trade side of the\neconomy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would\nprovide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however,\nimports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion\nof domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and\non balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real\nGDP.\n\nThe outlook for inflation was of key importance to the\nformulation of monetary policy at this time, but it was clouded by\nsubstantial uncertainty. One source of uncertainty was the behavior\nof food and energy prices. Increases in these prices largely\naccounted for the more rapid rise in consumer prices thus far this\nyear, and they likely would continue to add to inflation in the months\nahead. Retail energy prices had risen appreciably, but at least some\nof that increase was expected to be reversed over the near term.\nRetail food prices did not yet display any significant effects from\nthe sizable rise in grain prices in recent months, and while some\neffects on retail prices were likely, their extent and duration were\ndifficult to gauge at this point. Moreover, it was difficult to\nanticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect\ninflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become\nembedded more generally in the price structure.\n\nAlso of concern to the members were the possible effects on\ninflation of continued pressures on resources, especially if the\ncurrent pace of the expansion should fail to moderate as much as\nprojected. In recent years, the relationship between resource use and\ninflation had not followed earlier patterns. In particular, increases\nin labor compensation had been comparatively subdued over an extended\nperiod of what seemed to be relatively full employment highlighted by\nanecdotal reports of scarcities of various types of labor in numerous\nparts of the country. In part, worker willingness to accept compara-\ntively limited increases in compensation could be attributed to the\napparent rise in insecurity about the permanence of jobs or the\navailability of alternative jobs, but the reasons were not fully\nunderstood. From the standpoint of the inflation outlook, it\ntherefore was uncertain how long the period of relatively restrained\nincreases in labor compensation would last. Against this background,\na number of members indicated that they perceived an appreciable risk\nof rising labor costs and related inflation, even though there was\nlittle evidence to date of such developments; others noted that they\ncould not rule out the possibility that the favorable experience would\nbe extended.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The members agreed\nthat the balance of risks on inflation had shifted substantially since\nearly in the year. At that time, the economy had seemed sluggish and\ninflation was seen as possibly easing, but more recent developments\nindicated that the economy was stronger and rising inflation down the\nroad could not be ruled out. Nonetheless, while policy might need to\nbe firmed at some point to head off emerging inflation pressures,\nfinancial conditions were not so obviously stimulative as to counsel a\nneed for any immediate tightening of policy. The real federal funds\nrate probably was not greatly out of line with its appropriate level,\nand the rise in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate meant\nthat financial conditions were now exerting more restraint than\nearlier this year. More information might provide a better sense of\nhow the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and\nperhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the\nconsiderable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to\ninflation. In any event, actual inflation data--apart from food and\nenergy prices--and many of the usual early warning signs of mounting\nprice pressures did not yet indicate a pickup in the underlying trend\nof prices. Accordingly, the members viewed policy as appropriately\npositioned under current circumstances, though ongoing developments\nwould need to be reassessed at the upcoming meeting in early July.\nSome members noted that the Committee would need to anticipate, and\nact to preclude, a rise in the core rate of inflation that, if it were\nto materialize, would be difficult and costly to reverse. In this\nregard. the view was expressed that a firming in policy sooner rather\nthan later was likely to end up promoting stability in output and\nprices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting\nadjustments to policy, all the members indicated at least some\npreference for retaining a symmetric directive. Members commented\nthat the probability of developments during this period that would\nwarrant a change in policy before the next meeting was quite low,\nMoreover, symmetry did not rule out an intermeeting adjustment, and\nthe Chairman could call for a Committee consultation should the\nincoming information raise questions about the stance of monetary\npolicy. Some members felt that it was especially appropriate that a\npolicy action that represented a reversal of the previous move be made\nwith a full discussion at a regular meeting. Some members also\ncommented that an asymmetric directive toward restraint would imply a\npredisposition on the part of the Committee to tighten policy at some\npoint, possibly at the next meeting. While they would be prepared to\ntake such a step if the evidence warranted, their preference was to\ncome into the July meeting without such a presumption.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated a preference for a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nthat did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions\ncontemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nShort-term market interest rates have changed little\nwhile long-term rates have risen somewhat further since\nthe Committee meeting on March 26. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms\nof the other G-10 currencies has appreciated considerably\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April\nafter recording sizable increases earlier in the year.\nFor the year through April, both aggregates grew at rates\nsomewhat above the upper bounds of their respective\nranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic\nnonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over\nrecent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January\nestablished ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5\npercent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.\nThe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint\nor slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable\nin the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve\nconditions are expected to be consistent with moderate\ngrowth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for this action:\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey, McTeer,\nMs. Phillips, Mr. Stern, and Ms. Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on\nTuesday-Wednesday, July 2-3, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m."
