Conrad\nby the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of\nCleveland and Chicago as alternate member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee for the period ending with the appointment\nof a president for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or\nDecember 31, 1994, whichever comes first, and that he had\nexecuted his oath of office.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on July 5-6, 1994, were approved.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets during the period since the July meeting.\nThere were no System open market transactions in foreign currencies\nduring this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod July 6, 1994, through August 15, 1994. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\npace of economic expansion, though still substantial, might have\nslowed somewhat recently. Consumer spending continued to post\nmoderate gains, supported by rising labor income and favorable\nsentiment. Business outlays for plant and equipment remained on a\nsteep uptrend, but higher interest rates seemed to be having some\nrestraining effect on homebuilding activity. Resource utilization was\nat elevated levels, with factories operating at relatively high rates\nand labor markets evidencing very low levels of slack. Increases in\nbroad indexes of consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in\nrecent months, apart from the effects of short-run swings in the\nvolatile food and energy components.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a robust\npace in July. Hiring in the services industries remained strong, with\npersonnel supply agencies posting another sizable increase. Jobs also\nwere up substantially in retail trade and construction. By contrast,\nemployment in manufacturing was held down by strike activity. The\ncivilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent in July, little\nchanged from the average for the second quarter.\n\nIndustrial production rose moderately in July after a sizable\ngain in June; a decline in electricity generation from its unusually\nhigh weather-related level in June damped the July advance.\nManufacturing output was up considerably in July, despite a drop in\nthe production of motor vehicles and parts; outside of motor vehicles,\nincreases were widespread, with a very large rise recorded in the\noutput of durable consumer goods. The overall rate of capacity\nutilization in manufacturing remained at a high level, with most major\nindustry groups operating at or near capacity.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending had slowed in recent months,\nowing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Nominal\nretail sales edged lower in July after expanding at a slightly reduced\npace in the second quarter. Sales at general merchandise and\nfurniture and appliance stores increased further in July, while\npurchases at apparel outlets were down after large June increases.\nSales at automotive dealerships fell appreciably in July after edging\nlower in the second quarter; these sales declines apparently resulted\nin part from the inability of manufacturers to produce enough of the\nmost popular models. Housing starts in July retraced part of a large\nJune decline but remained below their elevated rate in the fourth\nquarter of 1993.\n\nBusiness fixed investment expanded in the second quarter at\nabout the same brisk pace as in the first quarter but well below the\nrate recorded in 1993. In the second quarter, a strong recovery in\nnonresidential construction activity from the weather-related decline\nof the first quarter offset a marked slowing in business purchases of\ndurable equipment. Much of the slowdown in the growth of outlays for\nequipment reflected a reduction in the pace of acquisition of office\nand computing equipment. Other categories of durable equipment, with\nthe exception of aircraft and motor vehicles, continued to show solid\nincreases. Most indicators of business investment activity suggested\nfurther large gains in coming months: Orders for nondefense capital\ngoods pointed to a continued strong expansion in spending on business\nequipment, and permits for nonresidential construction had been rising\nas well.\n\nBusiness inventory investment slowed in June after a sharp\nacceleration in April and May; for the second quarter as a whole,\ninventories were up substantially but they appeared to have remained\nbroadly in line with sales. In manufacturing, recent inventory\nbuildups had been concentrated in a few industries where orders had\nbeen particularly strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of\nstocks to shipments declined from an already low level. At the\nwholesale level, the accumulation of inventories in the second quarter\nwas largely in durable goods, which were in strong demand; the\ninventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained below the range that\nhas prevailed in recent years. A large part of the buildup of retail\ninventories in the second quarter was in nondurable goods, especially\nin stocks of general merchandise. For the retail sector as a whole,\nthe inventory-to-sales ratio at the end of June was near the high end\nof the range observed in recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened slightly in May; for April and May combined, the deficit was\nsignificantly larger than in the first quarter. Exports of goods and\nservices were about the same in May as in April, with increased\nshipments of machinery and industrial supplies offset by reduced\nexports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services were\nslightly higher in May than in April. Most of the increase was in\nimports of oil, as a consequence of higher prices, and consumer goods.\nThe economies of all the major foreign industrial countries continued\nto expand in the second quarter. Growth remained at a healthy pace in\nthe United Kingdom and Canada and appeared to have firmed in\ncontinental Europe. In Japan, growth apparently slowed somewhat in\nthe second quarter.\n\nTrends in broad measures of prices and labor costs had shown\nno change thus far in 1994. In July, the overall index of consumer\nprices rose at the same pace as in June, despite larger monthly\nincreases in the food and energy components of the index. The jump in\nenergy prices reflected the effects of the earlier run-up in crude oil\nprices. For the twelve months ended in July, both the overall index\nand the index excluding food and energy rose by about the same amounts\nas during the preceding twelve-month period. At the producer level,\nprices of finished goods were up significantly in July after no change\nin June; large price increases were recorded for coffee and finished\nenergy goods. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy\nwere unchanged on balance over June and July and registered only a\nsmall rise over the twelve months ended in July. At an earlier stage\nof processing, producer prices of intermediate materials posted\nanother sizable gain in July. These prices had increased at a faster\nrate thus far this year than in 1993, mirroring a similar pattern in\nprices of nonfood, non-energy crude materials. The employment cost\nindex for private industry workers rose more rapidly in the second\nquarter after a sharp slowing in the first quarter, with the\nacceleration in compensation largely reflecting a pickup in wage and\nsalary growth. The increase in total compensation over the last four\nquarters was little changed from the advance over the previous four-quarter period.\n\nAt its meeting on July 5-6, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nor slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose over the period in\naccommodation of the usual summer pickup in demands for seasonal\ncredit and averaged near anticipated levels. The federal funds rate\nremained close to 4-1/4 percent.\n\nOther market interest rates were unchanged to up slightly on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. Rates generally edged lower\nduring the early part of the period as incoming data were viewed by\nmarket participants as being consistent with continued moderation in\nfinal demands and a reduced need for any further monetary tightening\nactions. In early August, however, interest rates began to erase\ntheir previous declines, partly in response to the strong employment\nreport, which generated expectations that monetary policy might need\nto be tightened substantially in the near term. Most major indexes of\nequity prices were up on balance over the intermeeting period, with\nsecond-quarter corporate profits generally better than had been\nexpected.\n\nThe trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other\nG-10 currencies declined early in the intermeeting period but later\nrecouped its losses and ended the period unchanged on balance. The\nfluctuations in the dollar partly reflected evolving perceptions of\nthe degree to which U.S. authorities were concerned about further\nweakness in the currency. Over the intermeeting period, the dollar\ndepreciated slightly against the mark but edged higher against the\nyen.\n\nBoth M2 and M3 expanded in July after declining on average\nover May and June. The growth of M2 in July owed in part to a sizable\nincrease in liquid deposits, but in light of a resumption of run-offs\nat bond mutual funds it also may have reflected a renewed preference\nby households for the protection of principal provided by money market\nmutual funds. The strength in M2 showed through to M3, which also was\nboosted by funds garnered from wholesale sources to finance a surge in\nbank credit. For the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates\nslightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate pace.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy was operating close to its long-run capacity and that\ngrowth would trend lower over the next several quarters to a rate\ngenerally in line with the increase in its potential. Under these\ncircumstances, trends in the core rate of inflation would not deviate\nsignificantly from recent experience, but there was a risk that such\nan outcome might require further monetary policy tightening. Growth\nin consumer spending was projected to slow in response to smaller\ngains in employment and income, some reductions in pent-up demands,\nand the adverse effects on household financial wealth of earlier\nincreases in interest rates and declines in stock market prices.\nBusiness fixed investment, while remaining relatively brisk, was\nexpected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast horizon, primarily\nowing to smaller projected gains in sales, a growing shortfall of\ncorporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing\ncosts. Single-family housing construction would continue to be damped\nby the higher mortgage rates; however, the pace of homebuilding was\nexpected to remain relatively robust compared with the rate of recent\nyears, reflecting still unsatisfied demand for homeownership and the\nrelatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing, as judged by\nthe standards of the past two decades. The restraint on economic\nactivity exerted by weak export demand was projected to diminish as\neconomic conditions improved abroad, given the competitiveness of U.S.\nproduced goods.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that final aggregate demand\nappeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months but that the\nexpansion still seemed to have considerable underlying momentum.\nIndeed, available data on the various components of spending taken\ntogether might in fact be understating the growth in economic\nactivity; the strength of labor markets and measures of gross domestic\nincome suggested a somewhat stronger economic performance. Sustained\nexpansion, perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the\neconomy's long-run growth potential, remained a reasonable\nexpectation, but many members observed that they saw the risks as\nbeing on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some\nfurther policy tightening. Views varied to some degree with regard to\navailable margins of unemployed resources, but the members agreed that\nthe economy probably was operating very close to, and in the view of\nsome might have reached, its long-run potential. In these\ncircumstances, the members saw appreciable risks of intensifying\npressures on resources and higher inflation. Broad measures of wages\nand prices suggested little change in inflation trends in recent\nquarters, but worrisome signs of greater inflation were evident in the\nprices of materials purchased by business firms and in anecdotal\nreports of successful efforts by an increasing number of businesses to\npass on rising costs by raising prices.\n\nIn their comments on business conditions in different parts\nof the nation, members reported continuing expansion ranging from\nmodest to solid growth in most regions, However, the rise in business\nactivity appeared to have slowed in some areas and business conditions\nhad remained essentially unchanged in a number of others, notably in\nCalifornia. In the course of their review, members pointed to the\ngeneral strength in labor markets as evidenced, for example, by\nstatistical indications of large and persisting gains in employment\nand relatively low initial claims for unemployment compensation.\nThese data for the national economy were reinforced by reports of\nsizable employment increases in numerous industries and parts of the\ncountry and associated indications of growing labor shortages in a\nnumber of areas and some occupations.\n\nThe financial climate remained supportive of sustained\neconomic growth. It was clear that the rise in interest rates since\nthe start of the year had had some restraining effects on interest-sensitive expenditures, notably housing and perhaps to a lesser extent\nsome consumer durables, but to date these effects had not been large.\nMoreover, surveys and anecdotal reports suggested that banking\ninstitutions were becoming increasingly aggressive in their efforts to\nfoster loan growth by easing many terms and standards for lending. In\nfinancial markets more generally, risk spreads had remained relatively\nnarrow and both debt and equity markets appeared to be well positioned\nto provide ample financing for further economic expansion.\n\nIn their review of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members saw widespread evidence of a well established\nexpansion. Some signs of moderation from the rapid advance in recent\nquarters had emerged, including statistical and anecdotal indications\nof somewhat slower growth of consumer spending. Members noted,\nhowever, that an apparently significant portion of the recent weakness\nin sales of motor vehicles appeared to be related to supply shortages\nthat were in the process of being corrected. Consumer confidence\nremained at a high level and likely reflected, among other factors,\nthe strength in job markets in many parts of the country. Nonetheless, more moderate consumer spending was a reasonable expectation\nin the context of a low saving rate, increased consumer debt levels,\nand higher interest rates. One member commented that some pause in\nthe expansion of overall consumer spending would not be unusual after\nseveral quarters of robust growth, and another remarked that the rise\nin household expenditures had been larger than the increase in\nhousehold cash incomes by an appreciable margin over the past year.\n\nFurther marked expansion in business-fixed investment was\nlikely to make a sizable contribution to continuing economic growth.\nOngoing strength in orders, including foreign demand, pointed to rapid\nfurther growth in expenditures for business equipment over coming\nmonths. Some moderation in the growth of such spending appeared\nlikely later in the context of projected slower expansion in sales and\nthe rise in financing costs. The outlook for nonresidential\nconstruction, while not ebullient, nonetheless seemed likely to become\na more positive factor in fostering further economic growth. Demand\nfor commercial real estate space, including office space, had begun to\nimprove in many areas. Against this background and given the apparent\navailability of financing for soundly based projects, nonresidential\nconstruction activity, while displaying considerable local variation,\nappeared to be on a moderate uptrend for the nation as a whole.\n\nProspective developments in foreign trade also were expected\nto have a positive effect on the expansion of the domestic economy and\nindeed to offset some of the anticipated slowing in the overall growth\nof domestic demand. Economic conditions abroad were improving faster\nthan had been anticipated, and this development along with the decline\nin the foreign exchange value of the dollar was projected to stimulate\nfaster growth in exports while curbing that of imports over the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nMembers focused on recent inventory developments, which in\nthe context of some moderation in the growth of final demand had\naccounted for a considerable portion of the overall expansion in GDP\nreported for the second quarter. While the rate of inventory\naccumulation could be expected to slow in the current quarter, the\nextent of that slowing and its retarding effects on near-term economic\ngrowth were uncertain. Partly on the basis of anecdotal reports, the\nmembers concluded that much of the inventory buildup in the second\nquarter was voluntary, thereby reducing the probability of a sharp\nreversal. Indeed, to the degree that delivery lead times might edge\nup in various industries as capacity constraints were encountered,\nstronger efforts to build inventories could emerge, especially against\nthe background of currently low inventory-to-sales ratios. Some\nbusiness contacts reported that they were planning to add to their\ninventories over the months ahead. At the same time, ongoing business\nefforts to maintain relatively lean inventories undoubtedly would tend\nto limit any broad buildup in inventories.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for residential construction,\nmembers reported some slowing in single-family housing demand in many\nparts of the country as homebuyers reacted to the rise in mortgage\ninterest rates. However, single-family homebuilding activity was\nbeing maintained at relatively robust levels in some areas and\nmultifamily housing construction was improving in numerous local\nmarkets. On balance, the housing sector probably would contribute\nlittle, if any, impetus to the expansion but homebuilding was likely\nto remain well above its earlier depressed levels.\n\nIn their assessment of the outlook for inflation, many\nmembers focused on the prospects for further growth in output in the\ncontext of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources.\nIt was difficult to assess the extent of remaining margins of\navailable resources, in part because of uncertainty about the effects\non capacity of ongoing efforts to improve productivity through\nbusiness restructurings and sharp increases in business investment\nexpenditures. Despite somewhat differing views, the members generally\nconcluded that the economy probably was operating at a level that was\nquite close to, if not already at, its long-run potential. In the\ncircumstances, many of the members commented that the risks of\nintensifying inflation clearly were on the upside if the economic\nexpansion did not moderate from its pace in recent quarters.\nIndications of accelerating cost and price pressures were not yet\nvisible in broad measures of inflation and wages. Those measures,\nwhile subject to fluctuations largely associated with swings in food\nand energy prices, had not displayed any discernible trend over the\npast several quarters. At the same time, signs of increasing prices\nand costs at earlier stages of production appeared to be multiplying,\nincluding sizable price increases for a wide range of industrial\ncommodities. More generally, members cited a growing number of\nreports by business firms of rising input costs and of more successful\nefforts by some firms to raise prices. It also was noted that the\ndecline in the value of the dollar would contribute, directly and\nindirectly, to some upward pressures on prices. However, business\ncontacts, notably at the retail level, indicated that competition\nremained intense and made it very difficult to pass on cost increases\nthrough higher prices, thereby placing a premium on continued efforts\nto contain costs through improvements in productivity. From a\ndiffering perspective, one member noted that decelerating growth in\nmoney measures such as Ml, the monetary base, and reserves--which had\nbeen expanding rapidly for several years--implied that monetary policy\nhad been moved substantially to curtail any increase in inflation\npressures, though more action might still be required.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, the members agreed that a prompt further tightening move\nwas needed to provide greater assurance that inflationary pressures in\nthe economy would remain subdued. The members recognized that the\nCommittee's earlier policy actions were exerting some restraining\neffects and that further lagged effects from those actions could be\nexpected. Even so, the underlying strength in demand and narrow\nmargins of slack in the economy pointed to a considerable risk of\nfurther inflation pressures in the absence of additional policy\ntightening.\n\nWith regard to the size of the policy adjustment, the members\nwere apprised of a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors\nto approve the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that\nwas pending at several Federal Reserve Banks. The Committee members\nendorsed a proposal to allow the effects of such a rise in the\ndiscount rate, should it be approved, to be reflected fully in reserve\nmarkets. Consideration was given to a lesser adjustment in reserve\nconditions, but the members concluded that a smaller step was unlikely\nto be adequate, and on perceiving this, financial markets would\nquickly build in further monetary tightening, the unknown size and\ntiming of which would add to market uncertainty and volatility. A\nmore decisive policy move might reduce the need for further tightening\nlater, or possibly even avert that need entirely, by moderating or\narresting the inflationary momentum in the economy more promptly and\nby helping to curb inflationary expectations more effectively.\n\nIn considering possible adjustments to policy during the\nperiod before the next meeting, all the members favored moving to a\nsymmetric intermeeting instruction. Such a directive would be\nconsistent with the members' expectations that a further policy action\nwas not likely to be needed for some time, given the substantial\nnature of today's policy move. However, a symmetrical directive would\nnot rule out the possibility of a policy move in the event that\nintermeeting developments differed substantially from expectations.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all\nthe members indicated they could support a directive that called for\nincreasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that\ndid not include a presumption about possible adjustments to policy\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nslightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff\nanalysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the pace of economic expansion, though still\nsubstantial, may have moderated somewhat recently,\nwhile resource utilization has remained at high levels.\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a\nrobust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate\nedged up to 6.1 percent--about the same as the average\nfor the second quarter. Industrial production rose\nappreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer\nspending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to\nconstraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing\nstarts rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital\ngoods point to a continued strong expansion in spending\non business equipment; permits for nonresidential\nconstruction have been rising as well. Business\ninventories registered a large increase in the second\nquarter, but inventories appeared to have remained\nbroadly in line with sales. The average nominal\ndeficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger\nin April and May than the average for the first\nquarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and\nproducer prices have remained moderate in recent\nmonths, apart from the effect of short-run swings in\nvolatile food and energy components.\n\nMost market interest rates are unchanged to up\nslightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period.\n\nM2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on\naverage in both aggregates over May and June; for the\nyear through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly\nabove the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at\na moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of\n1994. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases could\npersist during the year and that money growth within\nthese ranges would be consistent with its broad policy\nobjectives. The monitoring range for growth of total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed\non tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of\n1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for\nM3. The Committee provisionally set the associated\nmonitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial\ndebt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the\nmonetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\nthe light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase in the discount\nrate. In the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nwould be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,\nKelley, LaWare, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses.\nPhillips and Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, September 27, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
