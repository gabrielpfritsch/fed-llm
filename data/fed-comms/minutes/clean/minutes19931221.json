Attended part of the meeting.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee held on November 16, 1993, were\napproved.\n\nBy unanimous vote, responsibility for making decisions on\nappeals of denials by the Secretary of the Committee for access to\nCommittee records was delegated under the provisions of 271.4(d) of\nthe Committee's Rules regarding Availability of Information to Mr.\nMullins and, in his absence, to Ms. Phillips.\n\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments\nin foreign exchange markets during the period since the November\nmeeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign\ncurrencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod November 16, 1993, through December 20, 1993. By unanimous\nvote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\nand financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over\nthe intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and\nfinancial information available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had recorded a strong advance in recent months.\nConsumer spending had picked up, and business purchases of durable\nequipment had remained on a marked upward trend. Residential\nconstruction was rising rapidly, and nonresidential construction had\nturned up from depressed levels. Industrial production had been\nboosted by developments in the motor vehicle industry, and employment\nhad continued to post solid gains. Most indexes of prices pointed to\nlittle change in inflation trends despite the recent acceleration of\neconomic activity.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in\nNovember. Another substantial increase in jobs was recorded in the\nservices industries, notably in health and business services.\nConstruction employment was up significantly further after registering\nmodest gains on balance over the first three quarters of 1993. In\nmanufacturing, there were back-to-back increases in jobs in October\nand November following seven consecutive monthly declines, and both\novertime hours and the average workweek remained at a high level.\nMost of the November expansion in factory jobs occurred in the motor\nvehicle and capital goods industries. The civilian unemployment rate\nfell considerably in November, to 6.4 percent.\n\nIndustrial production increased sharply in October and\nNovember. Manufacturing accounted for all the gain over the two\nmonths, with the rise partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the\nproduction of motor vehicles and parts. Elsewhere in manufacturing,\nstrong advances were recorded in the output of computers and non-auto\ndurable consumer goods. The sharp expansion in production was\nassociated with substantial increases in the rate of utilization of\nindustrial capacity in October and November.\n\nRetail sales were up moderately in November after a large\nadvance in October. Motor vehicle sales surged in October and\nremained at the higher level in November, apparently reflecting in\npart favorable financing terms, small price increases--adjusted for\nquality improvements--on 1994 models, and generous incentives on\npickup trucks from some manufacturers. Sales of apparel, furniture\nand appliances, and other durable goods also were strong on balance\nover October and November. Housing starts rose substantially in\nNovember; starts of single-family units reached their highest level\nsince early 1987, but starts of multifamily units edged lower. Sales\nof both new and existing homes remained robust in October.\n\nBusiness spending for durable equipment apparently continued\nto rise rapidly. Among nondefense capital goods other than aircraft,\nshipments of computers and other durable equipment were significantly\nhigher in October than in the third quarter. In addition, the demand\nfor heavy trucks remained strong, and the brisk sales of light\nvehicles in October and November likely were the result in part of a\nstep-up in spending by businesses. Nonresidential construction\nactivity increased again in October: Office building declined further\nand industrial construction retraced part of a sizable September gain,\nbut outlays for institutional, public utilities, and non-office\ncommercial structures continued to move higher.\n\nBusiness inventories were little changed in October, with\nreductions in manufacturing and wholesale stocks nearly offsetting\nincreases at the retail level. A moderate further decline in\nmanufacturers' inventories in October was concentrated among producers\nof aircraft and parts, where stocks have been contracting for more\nthan two years; the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as a\nwhole fell to its lowest level in recent years. In the wholesale\nsector, inventories declined in October after changing little in\nSeptember, and the ratio of inventories to sales remained in the\nmiddle of its range over the past several years. At the retail level,\nstocks increased considerably further; with sales expanding\nvigorously, however, the ratio of stocks to sales edged lower and this\nratio also was in the middle of its range over the past several years.\n\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for October was\nabout unchanged from its September level and its average rate for the\nthird quarter. The value of both exports and imports increased in\nOctober. Exports of automotive products rose strongly, and exports of\naircraft rebounded from a September downturn. The advance in imports\nwas spread across all major categories. Economic activity in the\nmajor foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third\nquarter; however, available data suggested that output in Japan and\nGermany might decline in the current quarter, with a depressing effect\non growth for these industrial countries as a group.\n\nBroad indexes of consumer and producer prices pointed to\nlittle change in inflation trends, although prices of some commodities\nand industrial materials had firmed recently. Producer prices of\nfinished goods were unchanged in November after declining in October\nand over the third quarter. In November, a large drop in the prices\nof finished energy goods offset a rebound in the prices of other\nfinished goods. Producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished\ngoods were about unchanged over the twelve months ended in November.\nAt the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy\nadvanced moderately in November; the twelve-month increase in this\nprice measure was a little smaller than the rise over the comparable\nperiod ended in November 1992. Average hourly earnings edged up in\nNovember; for the twelve months ended in November, these earnings were\nup by a smaller amount than over the preceding year.\n\nAt its meeting on November 16, 1993, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of\nthe Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and\nM3 over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat less\nthan anticipated levels, reflecting very light amounts of adjustment\nborrowing over most of the period, and the federal funds rate remained\nclose to 3 percent.\n\nWhile most short-term interest rates changed little over the\nintermeeting period, signs of stronger economic growth and the firming\nof some commodity prices tended to push up longer-term interest rates,\nalthough that pressure was offset to some extent by declines in oil\nprices. Taken as a whole, incoming economic data were seen by market\nparticipants as increasing the odds of a tightening of monetary policy\nat some point but not necessarily in the very near term. Most\nindexes of stock prices fell slightly over the intermeeting period,\nbut the strong performance of a few firms boosted the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average to a new high near the end of the period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated against\nthe yen in response to incoming data suggesting weakness in the\nJapanese economy and heightened prospects for further monetary easing\nby the Bank of Japan. Even though interest rates eased in Europe as\ncentral banks lowered their money-market intervention rates, the\ndollar was little changed against the German mark and declined\nsomewhat against other European currencies.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November;\nboth aggregates had risen at somewhat faster rates since late summer\nthan earlier in the year. Ml growth remained brisk in November, and\nmoney funds included in M2 apparently benefited from a slowdown in\ninflows to bond funds in the wake of the earlier decline in bond\nprices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in term Eurodollar\ndeposits as well as faster growth of M2. For the year through\nNovember, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates somewhat\nabove the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total\ndomestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months,\nand for the year through November it was estimated to have increased\nat a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that,\nafter a strong fourth-quarter advance, the economy would expand at a\nmore moderate rate in 1994. Consumer spending was projected to\ndecelerate to a rate more in line with the growth of disposable\nincome. Business fixed investment was expected to advance briskly,\nalthough not quite as rapidly as in 1993, and further gains in\nhomebuilding activity likely would be concentrated in the first half\nof the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered\nby a modest pickup in foreign economic growth. Fiscal restraint was\nexpected to exert a substantial drag on spending, through both falling\ngovernment defense purchases and higher taxes. In light of the\nlimited margins of slack in labor and product markets, the ongoing\nexpansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further\nreduction in inflation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members referred to widespread indications,\nboth statistical and anecdotal, of a marked strengthening in economic\nactivity and much improved business and consumer confidence in recent\nmonths. The rate of economic growth could be expected to moderate\nduring the early months of 1994 from what currently appeared to be an\nunsustainable pace, but the members viewed the extent of such\nmoderation as a key uncertainty in the outlook. A number of members\nobserved that a sharp slowing of the expansion early next year,\nsimilar to the slowdown after the surge in activity during the closing\nmonths of 1992, could not be ruled out. However, most saw the gains\nin the economy as more solidly based than earlier in the expansion,\nand they generally expected the economy to settle into a pattern of\nmoderate growth over coming quarters at a trend rate close to or\nsomewhat above the economy's long-run potential. With regard to the\noutlook for inflation, the members saw little evidence in available\nmeasures of prices and wages or in other indicators that any\nsignificant change might already have occurred in underlying inflation\ntrends. Nonetheless, views varied somewhat with regard to the outlook\nand ranged from expectations of some modest further decline in the\ncore rate of inflation to concerns about the possibility of some\nacceleration in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed\nproduction resources and an accommodative monetary policy as reflected\nin low real short-term interest rates and continued rapid growth in\nnarrow measures of money and reserves.\n\nIn their comments about developments across the nation,\nmembers observed that economic conditions clearly had strengthened in\nmany regions and that the better conditions had fostered appreciable\nimprovement in business and consumer sentiment in most parts of the\ncountry. The members recognized that the economic expansion was still\nquite subdued in many local areas and that economic activity remained\ndepressed in some parts of the country such as southern California.\nThe overall strength of the economy was fueled to an important extent\nby interest-sensitive spending on producer and consumer durables and\nhousing and tended to confirm the durability of the expansion.\nGains in such spending were not likely to be sustained at their recent\nrates, but the cash flow and income that such expenditures had\ngenerated were likely to foster further economic growth, especially in\nthe context of generally supportive conditions in financial and credit\nmarkets. The members acknowledged that a number of factors continued\nto constrain the expansion, including ongoing though less pervasive\nbalance-sheet rebuilding, business restructuring and downsizing\nactivities, and the downtrend in defense spending. On balance,\nhowever, current developments did not point to a marked deviation from\nthe moderate growth trend in economic activity that had been\nexperienced over the past two years, though in the view of a number of\nmembers the odds on somewhat stronger growth were greater than they\nhad been earlier in the expansion.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy,\nconsumer expenditures were seen as likely to continue to provide vital\nsupport to the expansion even though increases in consumer spending\nwere not likely to be maintained at recent rates. Members noted that\nthe improved consumer confidence and increased spending were reflected\nin a somewhat greater willingness to incur debt, at least in the\ncontext of reduced interest rates. Some members cautioned, however,\nthat growth in consumer expenditures had exceeded gains in incomes for\nan extended period, insofar as could be judged from available data,\nand an already low saving rate seemed likely to limit the potential\ngrowth in such spending. Moreover, the negative impact of increased\ntax rates on high incomes seemed likely to be felt especially during\nthe first half of 1994, though the extent of that impact on consumer\nspending remained uncertain. On the positive side, members cited a\nnumber of developments that would tend to bolster overall consumer\nexpenditures, including lower energy costs, reduced income taxes for\nmany individuals stemming from indexing, and lower interest charges on\nvarious kinds of debt. More generally, the rise in consumer\nconfidence seemed to be related to perceptions of improving employment\nopportunities despite continuing announcements of sizable workforce\nreductions by some large firms.\n\nThe members expected growth in real business investment to\nremain robust in 1994 but to decelerate somewhat from the rapid rate\nof expansion over the past year. Continuing increases in business\nsales and low financing costs along with ongoing efforts to improve\nproductivity were likely to remain conducive to substantial further\ngrowth in overall spending for business equipment despite persisting\nweakness in aerospace and defense-related industries. Nonresidential\nconstruction activity, including commercial and industrial building\nand infrastructure construction, displayed signs of considerable\nstrength in some parts of the country; and declining vacancy rates\npointed to a leveling out or even a pickup in nonresidential building\nconstruction in a number of other areas. Some expansion in inventories seemed likely over the forecast horizon to accommodate the\ncontinuing growth in overall demands. In this connection, members\nnoted that a rise in inventories probably contributed to the expansion\nin production in recent months since the latter could not be explained\nentirely by the strength of final demand, and a buildup of motor\nvehicle stocks in late 1993 was likely to continue into the early part\nof 1994.\n\nThe housing sector was expected to remain a source of\nconsiderable economic stimulus during the early months of 1994, both\ndirectly and indirectly in terms of the favorable effects on purchases\nof home furnishings. Some members commented that the increases in\nhousing starts experienced over the closing months of this year might\nnot be sustainable; even so, housing construction, especially in the\nsingle-family sector, should be relatively well maintained given the\nlikelihood that home ownership would remain comparatively affordable\nin the context of growing incomes, favorable mortgage rates, and\nlimited pressures on the prices of new homes.\n\nWith respect to fiscal policy, members referred to the\nprospects for further cutbacks in defense spending that probably would\ncontinue to be offset only in part by growth in federal government\npurchases of other goods and services. However, net reductions in\ngovernment purchases were expected to diminish over the projection\nhorizon. Likewise, adverse effects on spending of the rise in tax\nrates on higher incomes would tend to be concentrated in the first\nhalf of 1994, and the impact on spending over the months ahead might\nwell be relatively limited because many taxpayers probably had\nanticipated the higher taxes and had taken measures to mitigate or\nspread out their effects or would meet new tax obligations partly out\nof savings. Proposed health care reform legislation would exert a\nrestraining effect on the economy, should it be enacted, owing to\nmandated cost increases on employers. If this form of financing were\nadopted, however, the legislation might have little, or perhaps even a\nfavorable, effect on the federal deficit.\n\nThe external sector of the economy also appeared likely to\nhave a moderating effect on domestic economic activity over the year\nahead. The economies of key foreign industrial nations and thus U.S.\nexports to those nations were projected to grow only gradually, while\nthe expansion of U.S. imports was likely to remain relatively robust\non the basis of current expectations for domestic economic activity.\nIn the view of at least some members, however, stimulative economic\npolicies in a number of foreign countries might well lead to stronger\neconomic performances and to greater demand for U.S. goods and\nservices than many observers currently anticipated. In any event, the\nmembers generally agreed that the outlook for developments abroad\nremained a source of particular uncertainty for the domestic economy.\n\nMembers commented that there were few indications of any\nchange in inflationary trends in broad measures of prices and wages\ndespite the surge in economic activity in recent months and associated\nincreases in capacity utilization rates. One important sign of\ngrowing inflationary pressures, rising lead times for deliveries of\nmaterials, had not emerged. Some members noted that while capacity\nusage rates were approaching or had reached levels that in the past\nhad tended to signal the onset of rising inflation, the growth of\ncompetition stemming from the internationalization of numerous markets\nsuggested that old capacity benchmarks might no longer apply and,\nespecially in the context of excess capacity in many foreign\neconomies, the potential inflationary effects of strong domestic\ndemand pressures might remain subdued for some period of time. In\nkeeping with these assessments, members again reported on the absence\nof inflationary cost pressures in local areas across the country and\non persisting comments by business contacts regarding their inability\nto raise prices to achieve more satisfactory or customary profit\nmargins. Business executives continued to look to improvements in\nproductivity to maintain or increase their margins, and there were\nnumerous reports of considerable success in implementing productivity\ngains. Price developments in commodity markets presented a mixed\npicture; higher food prices stemming from weather conditions earlier\nin the year had had an adverse effect on broad measures of prices, but\nthe drop in energy prices had favorable implications for the near-term\ninflation outlook.\n\nIt also was noted that rising inflationary pressures often\nwere accompanied by a pickup in credit demands, and there was no\nevidence of any surge in such demands. However, the expansion of\noverall nonfinancial debt had strengthened to a degree. Moreover, in\nthe view of some members, the rise in long-term interest rates and in\ngold prices might well have been caused in part by heightened\ninflation concerns. Members also cited scattered examples of greater\nprice pressures, notably the prices of lumber and some other building\nmaterials and of related efforts to pass on the added costs through\nhigher prices on new homes in some areas. Despite the absence of any\ngeneral indication of rising inflation, a number of members expressed\nconcern about the potential for increasing inflationary pressures in\nthe economy and saw a need to monitor possible future sources of\ninflation with special care over the period ahead, especially in light\nof the considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their\neffects on prices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the\nperiod until the next scheduled meeting in early February, a majority\nof the members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in\nreserve markets and to retain the currently unbiased instruction in\nthe directive concerning possible intermeeting adjustments to policy.\nLooking forward, many of the members commented that the Committee\nprobably would have to firm reserve conditions at some point to adjust\nmonetary policy from its currently quite accommodative stance to a\nmore neutral position, and that such a policy move might have to be\nmade sooner rather than later to contain inflation and continue to\nprovide a sound basis for sustained economic expansion. Monetary\nconditions had been eased to their current degree of accommodation in\nthe 1990-1992 period in the context of balance-sheet restructuring and\nother unusual forces that were holding down spending. Since the\nlatter part of 1992, however, downside risks to the expansion had\ndiminished considerably as financial conditions became more supportive\nof economic activity. Borrowers and lenders had strengthened their\nfinancial positions substantially and were less reluctant to use and\nextend credit. Moreover, the low level of real short-term interest\nrates and in the view of some members the continued rapid growth of\nreserves or increases in a variety of commodity prices provided\nevidence of a quite accommodative monetary policy. Overstaying such a\npolicy would incur an increasing risk of fostering greater inflationary pressures that in turn would undermine the sustainablity of the\nexpansion. For now, however, a majority believed that the risks\nremained at an acceptable level, given the remaining slack in the\neconomy and the lack of near-term inflation pressures. Waiting for\nfurther developments before making any policy move was warranted in\nlight of the uncertainties surrounding the outlook, notably with\nregard to the extent of the moderation in economic growth expected\nearly next year. If the economy settled into a pattern of growth\nabout in line with its potential, the chances of greater inflation\npressures down the road would be reduced and the need for a near-term\npolicy adjustment would be less pressing, though it would still be\nrequired at some point.\n\nTwo members expressed a strong preference for a prompt move\ntoward a firmer policy stance to forestall inflation pressures. A\nnumber of others commented that the decision was a close call,\nincluding two who had a marginal preference for tightening policy at\nthis time but who could accept a delay in light of the uncertainties\nthat were involved.\n\nMembers who could support an unchanged policy stance also\nindicated their acceptance of a directive that was not biased in\neither direction with regard to possible adjustments in the degree of\nreserve pressure during the intermeeting period. Some observed that\nwhile the flow of economic reports during this period was likely to\nunderscore the marked strengthening of the economy, those reports\nmainly would cover developments in the fourth quarter, and from a\nmonetary policy perspective the members were more interested in\nknowing something about the extent of the follow-through strength\nearly in the new year. Moreover, the members recognized that any\ntightening move would represent a turn in policy that might well have\na greater-than-usual effect on financial markets. This prospect\nargued for taking such an action at a meeting, with the benefit of a\nfull Committee review of the implications for future growth and\ninflation pressures of a wide variety of emerging developments--including those in money, credit, and financial markets--rather than\nan intermeeting action based on an asymmetric directive. In the view\nof one member, a tightening action over the coming intermeeting period\nwould incur an undue risk of an exaggerated response in financial\nmarkets, given the likelihood of thin trading markets around year-end;\nand since a policy move should be postponed, a symmetrical directive\nseemed appropriate.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two\nof the members indicated that they could support a directive that\ncalled for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions and that did not include a presumption about the likely\ndirection of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.\nAccording to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at\nthis meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3\nover the months ahead.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\na strong advance in economic activity in recent months.\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably\nfurther in November, and the civilian unemployment rate\nfell considerably to 6.4 percent. Industrial\nproduction increased sharply in October and November,\npartly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of\nmotor vehicles. Retail sales were up moderately in\nNovember after, a large increase in October. Housing\nstarts advanced substantially in November. Business\nequipment expenditures have been rising rapidly, and\nnonresidential construction has turned up from\ndepressed levels. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade\ndeficit in October was about unchanged from its average\nrate in the third quarter. Broad indexes of consumer\nand producer prices suggest little change in inflation\ntrends, although prices of some raw materials have\nincreased recently.\n\nShort-term interest rates have changed little,\nwhile intermediate- and long-term rates have risen\nslightly since the Committee meeting on November 16.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value\nof the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is\nabout unchanged on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 strengthened in November, and\nboth aggregates have risen at somewhat faster rates\nsince late summer than earlier in the year. For the\nyear through November, M2 and M3 are estimated to have\ngrown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the\nCommittee's ranges for the year. Total domestic\nnonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in\nrecent months, and for the year through November it is\nestimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half\nof the Committee's monitoring range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in July lowered the ranges it had established\nin February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5\npercent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of\n1993. The Committee anticipated that developments\ncontributing to unusual velocity increases would\npersist over the balance of the year and that money\ngrowth within these lower ranges would be consistent\nwith its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was\nlowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the\nCommittee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary\ngrowth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and\n0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set\nthe monitoring range for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The\nbehavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be\nevaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and\ndevelopments in the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the\ncontext of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent\nwith moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, McTeer,\nMullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.\n\nVotes against this action: Messrs. Angell\nand Lindsey.\n\nMessrs. Angell and Lindsey dissented because they believed\nthat monetary policy was overly accommodative and needed to be\nadjusted promptly toward a more neutral stance to counter potential\ninflationary pressures in the economy. They referred to the long lags\nwith which monetary policy exerts its effects on inflation and the\nconsequent need to adjust monetary policy on a timely basis to foster\nthe Committee's long-run objective of stable prices. They understood\nthe difficulty of finding the appropriate circumstances for tightening\nactions so as to avoid unintended interpretations and repercussions in\nfinancial markets. In their judgment, economic and financial conditions were unlikely to be more favorable later and waiting risked\nundesirable inflationary consequences.\n\nMr. Angell also stressed that the Committee should focus more\ndirectly on forward-looking indicators such as the price of gold and\nthe estimate of the natural rate of interest provided by the rate on\nfive-year Treasury notes. He favored an immediate increase of 50\nbasis points in the federal funds rate, which would enable the\nCommittee to observe how the market adjusted the price of gold to the\nchanged opportunity cost of holding gold. He believed that if bond\nmarket participants concluded that the Committee was using the price\nof gold to target the price level, five-year and ten-year interest\nrates would then be significantly lower than if the Committee's\ntightening was a belated response to a worsening outlook for\ninflation. He emphasized that the objective of monetary policy\nclearly should be stable money which produces stable prices and an\nongoing optimal and stable economic growth path.\n\nMr. Lindsey commented further that a modest policy move now\nwould appropriately signal the Committee's concern about the potential\nfor inflation. Such an action would begin the process of moving\npolicy away from what he perceived as an unsustainable stance. He\nalso noted that foreign competition had been restraining pressures on\ndomestic prices, and the policy course he had in mind would continue\nto help in that regard by supporting the foreign exchange value of the\ndollar.\n\nRequest for access to conference call record.\n\nAt this meeting the Committee considered a request from Mr.\nHenry B. Gonzalez, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking,\nFinance, and Urban Affairs, for access by his staff to the tape\nrecording and transcript of the Committee's telephone conference on\nOctober 15, 1993. The main purpose of the conference call was to\ndiscuss what position the Committee should take on the release of\nmaterial about its deliberations that are contained in historical\nfiles of meeting transcripts; the issue undoubtedly would be raised in\nthe near future, probably during upcoming testimony before Chairman\nGonzalez' Committee on October 19, 1993.\n\nChairman Gonzalez had indicated that he was investigating the\npossibility that Committee members had conspired during the conference\ncall to hide information from the House Banking Committee. The\naccusation was wholly without merit, but at this stage the Committee\ncould fully vindicate itself only by making the tape and transcript\navailable to Congressional staff for their review.\n\nSuch a step would be taken with considerable reluctance.\nThe recording in question did not contain a discussion of monetary\npolicy, but it did involve Committee deliberations, which are\nprotected from public disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act.\nSome members expressed concern that granting access to this material\ncould be viewed as setting a precedent for the premature release of\nother tapes and transcripts, with adverse effects on the Committee's\ndeliberations. However, the Committee's General Counsel expressed the\nopinion that the Committee could make an exception for this transcript\nwithout prejudicing its ability to withhold deliberative or other\nprivileged materials in other transcripts under the Freedom of\nInformation Act. The members agreed with a proposal from the Chairman\nthat the staff of Chairman Gonzalez and of certain other Banking\nCommittee members be allowed to listen to the tape recording of the\nOctober 15 conference call. The review would be conducted at the\noffices of the Board of Governors, and the Congressional staff members\nwould be asked to keep confidential the information to be made\navailable to them. The members indicated that it should be made clear\nthat access to the tape in question was being undertaken solely to\ndispel the unfounded allegations regarding the Committee's actions.\nThe Committee already had decided to make public with a 5-year lag\nlightly edited versions of all the transcripts currently in the\npossession of the FOMC Secretariat. These transcripts as edited will\ninclude all the deliberative materials except for highly sensitive\ninformation that can continue to be withheld under the provisions of\nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Thursday-Friday, February 3-4, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:30 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
