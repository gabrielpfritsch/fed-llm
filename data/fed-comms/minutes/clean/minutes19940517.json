By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments\nin domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions\nin government securities and federal agency obligations during the\nperiod March 22, 1994, through May 16, 1994. By unanimous vote, the\nCommittee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had expanded substantially on balance thus far in\n1994. Favorable business expectations and buoyant consumer sentiment\nin the context of stronger gains in employment appeared to have\nsustained strong growth in domestic final demand. Broad measures of\ninflation had remained subdued and labor cost increases had been\nmoderate, though prices of industrial materials had continued to rise.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and\nApril, in part reflecting a rebound in industries affected by earlier\nsevere winter weather; for the first four months of the year, the\naverage monthly rise exceeded the improved pace of the fourth quarter.\nFurther large advances in employment in the March-April period were\nrecorded in the services sector, notably at personnel supply services\nfirms; hiring in construction was strong after earlier weather-related\nlosses; and the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to expand,\nalthough at a somewhat slower pace than in previous months. The\ncivilian unemployment rate registered another slight decline in April,\nto 6.4 percent, and the average workweek of production or\nnonsupervisory workers remained at an unusually high level.\n\nIndustrial production was up appreciably further in April,\nwith increases widespread across sectors. The pace of motor vehicle\nassemblies slowed, but much of the indicated slowdown reflected the\neffects of seasonal adjustment, which called for increases at a time\nwhen manufacturing operations already were at levels close to\ncapacity. Output of public utilities fell again, as electricity\ngeneration dropped with the return to less severe weather patterns.\nRates of industrial capacity utilization had risen rapidly in recent\nmonths and were at very high levels in many industries--especially in\nmotor vehicles, petroleum refining, lumber, and primary metals.\n\nRetail sales were estimated to have fallen in April after two\nmonths of very large increases. Despite the April decline, which was\nwidespread by type of retail outlet, outlays were considerably above\nthe first-quarter average. Sales of new and existing homes posted\nsignificant gains in March although they remained below their fourth-quarter averages. Housing starts decreased slightly in April but were\nwell above the depressed winter pace. The third consecutive monthly\ngain in multifamily starts was more than offset by a decline in\nsingle-family starts.\n\nReal business fixed investment continued to increase rapidly\nin the first quarter, but at a less robust pace than in the fourth\nquarter of 1993. Outlays for producers durable equipment posted\nanother sizable advance, spending for computing equipment surged\nagain, and purchases of most other types of equipment also continued\nto trend up. Moreover, business demand for automobiles and trucks\nremained strong. Outlays for nonresidential structures declined\nsharply in the first quarter, although construction activity showed\nsome recovery in March after the disruptions associated with severe\nweather during January and February.\n\nBusiness inventories declined in March, reversing part of the\nlarge run-up in stocks that had occurred in the first two months of\nthe year. For the first quarter as a whole, inventories rose at a\nslightly slower pace than in the second half of last year. In\nmanufacturing, the accumulation in the first quarter retraced much of\nthe drawdown that had taken place in previous months; the inventory-to-shipments ratio, already at a low level, edged still lower.\nWholesale inventories were down on balance over the first quarter,\nwith a large March decline more than retracing increases earlier in\nthe year; the ratio of inventories to sales was well below the range\nprevailing over the last several years. Retail inventories expanded\nmodestly in the first quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell\nslightly.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was\nlarger on average in January and February than it had been in the\nfourth quarter. The value of exports in the January-February period\nwas sharply below the unusually strong level in the fourth quarter but\nwas slightly higher than the levels recorded in the first three\nquarters of 1993. Exports were down in virtually all major trade\ncategories; one important exception was semiconductors, for which\nexports continued to trend higher. Imports in the two-month period\nfell by less than exports; nearly all of the decline reflected reduced\noil imports. Available indicators for the first quarter pointed to\nrecovery in economic activity at a moderate pace on average in the\nmajor foreign industrial countries. Signs of recovery ranged from\nquite tentative in Japan to relatively well-established in the United\nKingdom and Canada.\n\nIndexes of consumer and producer prices had increased\nslightly thus far in 1994. In April, consumer prices posted their\nsmallest rise since January; food prices were up a bit further, but\nenergy prices retraced their March run-up. Excluding the food and\nenergy components of the index, consumer prices edged up in April, and\nover the twelve months ending in April these prices increased less\nthan they had over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of\nfinished goods declined a little in April as prices of finished foods\nand energy moved down; for items other than food and energy, prices\nwere up slightly in April and for the twelve months ending in April.\nAt earlier stages of processing, the index of producer prices of crude\nmaterials other than food and energy was substantially above its year-ago level, despite a small drop in April. At the intermediate stage,\nthe prices of some important construction materials had increased\nsharply although, overall, prices of nonfood, non-energy goods had\nrisen only modestly over the past twelve months.\n\nIncreases in labor costs continued to moderate in early 1994.\nThe employment cost index for private industry workers rose more\nslowly in the first quarter of 1994 than in any quarter of 1993. The\nslowdown reflected more moderate growth in both wages and salaries and\nbenefit costs. Hourly compensation increased at a slightly slower\npace over the twelve months ending in March 1994 than over the\nprevious year. In April, average hourly earnings of production or\nnonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls increased moderately after\nhaving changed little over February and March.\n\nAt its meeting on March 22, 1994, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve\nrestraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The\nreserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of\n1994.\n\nImmediately after the meeting, open market operations were\ndirected toward implementing the slightly less accommodative degree of\nreserve pressure sought by the Committee. Subsequently, on April 18,\nagainst the background of incoming data suggesting considerable\nmomentum and diminishing slack in the economy and of indications that\nfinancial markets were less likely to be destabilized by a further\npolicy action, the degree of accommodation in reserve pressures was\nreduced a little further. The federal funds rate rose 1/4 percentage\npoint, to 3-1/2 percent, after the initial policy action; following\nthe second policy move, the funds rate went up another 1/4 percentage\npoint and generally remained near 3-3/4 percent. Over the\nintermeeting period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged\nslightly above anticipated levels.\n\nMost market interest rates increased by more than the federal\nfunds rate over the period since the March meeting, with the largest\nincreases occurring at intermediate maturities. Weakness in the\ndollar as well as the release of data suggesting considerable vigor in\neconomic activity appeared to have contributed to the upward pressure\non market rates. The bank prime rate was raised 3/4 percentage point,\nto 6-3/4 percent, while major indexes of stock prices fell\nsubstantially.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat further\non balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar's depreciation\noccurred despite the implementation of less accommodative policy\nactions in the United States and monetary easing moves in several key\nforeign countries. Market concerns about political developments in\nJapan as well as a worsened outlook for progress toward more open\ntrading relationships and for a more stimulative fiscal policy in that\ncountry contributed to downward pressure on the dollar. Against the\nbackdrop of a falling dollar, U.S. authorities conducted intervention\noperations on April 29 and again on May 4. The latter operations were\ncoupled with a statement by Treasury Secretary Bentsen indicating that\nintervention was being undertaken in response to recent movements in\nexchange markets that had gone beyond what could be justified by\neconomic fundamentals and was being conducted in concert with\noperations by other major countries. Subsequent to these actions, the\ndollar retraced part of its earlier decline.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 turned up, on balance, in March and\nApril despite the rising short-term opportunity costs of holding\ndeposits. The strengthening of these aggregates seemed to be related\nto a reassessment by households of the relative attractiveness of\ninvesting in capital market instruments; capital losses sparked\nsubstantial net redemptions at bond mutual funds over March and April\nthat were accompanied by a surge in flows to retail money market funds\nand slower runoffs of small time deposits. For the year through\nApril, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range\nfor 1994, and M3 at a pace somewhat above the lower end of its range.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate\nrate over recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity, after rebounding from the disruptions caused by\nadverse weather conditions earlier in the year, would expand in the\nsecond half of 1994 at a rate close to the growth of the economy's\npotential. Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household\nincome for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in\nline with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently\nreduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect,\nmuch of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable\ngoods. Business fixed investment would be restrained by the slower\ngrowth of business output and the associated moderation of corporate\ncash flows but would continue to advance at a faster rate than overall\neconomic activity. Homebuilding was projected to remain at a pace\nthat was relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years,\nthough a bit below that of the fourth quarter. The restraint on\noutput growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand\nwas expected to diminish somewhat. In light of limited margins of\nslack in labor and product markets over the forecast horizon, little\nor no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\ndevelopments, members commented on widespread indications, both\nstatistical and anecdotal, of considerable momentum in the economic\nexpansion. Business activity seemed to be rebounding smartly from the\ndisruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather, and it appeared\nthat the expansion over the first half of the year was likely to be a\nlittle stronger than had been expected at the time of the March\nmeeting. A deceleration in activity still seemed to be in train for\nthe second half, but the extent of such a slowing was an important\nsource of uncertainty in the outlook. The members continued to see\nmoderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy's\npotential as the most likely prospect, but the overall momentum of the\nexpansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy\nsuggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a\nperiod, with consequent implications for greater pressures on\nresources. At the same time, the members saw relatively few signs of\nthe kinds of imbalances that would pose a significant downside\npotential for the economy, although some cautioned that the rise in\nlong-term interest rates, recently weaker data on production and\nsales, and continuing anxiety about job security in an environment of\ncorporate restructuring contributed elements of fragility to what was\notherwise a healthy outlook. The near-term prospects for inflation\nwere favorable. Wage and price trends generally remained moderate;\nthe persisting high rate of business investment bode well for further\nenhancements of productivity; and competitive pressures, including\nthose from imported goods, were restraining efforts by firms to raise\nprices. The members were concerned, however, that in an environment\nin which slack in the economy already had been reduced to a fairly low\nlevel and could decline further in the quarters ahead, inflation could\nbegin to rise unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its\naccommodative stance.\n\nIn their comments about developments across the nation,\nmembers took note of the considerable strength in economic conditions\nin many parts of the country. However, they also recognized that some\nparts of the nation were experiencing relatively subdued growth and\nthat economic activity remained depressed in other areas such as\nSouthern California and Hawaii. The strong forward momentum in the\neconomy was most clearly evident in interest-sensitive sectors,\nincluding motor vehicles, other durable goods, and housing. The rise\nin interest rates over the course of recent months was cited by\nbusiness contacts as a potential source of restraint on interest-sensitive expenditures, but thus far relatively few contacts had\nreported actual examples of adverse interest-rate effects on spending.\nWhile higher rates would constrain aggregate demand going forward,\ntheir effects probably would be offset in part by more aggressive\nlending practices at banks and other institutions. At the same time,\nreports of industries that were operating at or near capacity limits\nwere becoming more numerous, and capacity constraints were said to be\nlimiting some sales.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy,\nconsumer expenditures were viewed by many members as likely to be well\nmaintained, particularly for motor vehicles and other consumer\ndurables. Reports from various parts of the country indicated that\nsales had tended in many areas to exceed retailers' expectations by a\nconsiderable margin in recent months. Some members noted, however,\nthat sales had been less ebullient since late winter and cited factors\nthat might work to restrain somewhat the growth of consumer spending.\nThese included high and rising debt levels, declines in household\nwealth owing to the drop in stock and bond prices, and the effects on\nconsumer confidence of ongoing workforce reductions associated with\nbusiness restructuring. Higher interest rates also might limit the\npace at which pent-up demands would continue to be satisfied. On\nbalance, in the view of a number of members, growth in consumer\nspending seemed likely to moderate to a pace close to the growth in\nincomes.\n\nMembers expected business fixed investment to continue to\nexpand at a pace substantially above that of the economy as a whole.\nWith production straining capacity limits in a number of industries\nand firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to\nmaintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers' durable\nequipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an\nanticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased\ncost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and\nlower equity prices. It was noted in this connection that order books\nat producers of capital equipment had grown considerably.\nNonresidential construction appeared to be rebounding from the\ndisruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather conditions;\nhowever, the pattern of construction activity across the nation was\nmixed, with some areas of the country displaying considerable strength\nin activity and other areas still depressed. The construction of\noffice buildings for the most part remained at very low levels, but\nanecdotal reports indicated that markets for office space, especially\nthose that had been hard hit in recent years, seemed to be improving\nconsiderably in some locales. Business inventories remained quite\nlean by historical standards, and some reports suggested that efforts\nto augment stocks had been negated by strong sales. With survey\nreports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on\nmaterials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing\nthat desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup\nin inventory investment might get under way, especially in\nmanufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new\nlows.\n\nResidential construction was indicated to be robust across\nmuch of the country, with activity picking up rapidly in the aftermath\nof the unusually severe winter. The affordability of housing remained\nhigh by historical standards, and the appeal of home ownership had\nbeen enhanced somewhat by the apparent firming of house prices over\nthe past year. In these circumstances, housing activity had been well\nsustained, although there were some indications that the higher\nmortgage rates now prevailing had begun to damp residential\ninvestment.\n\nThe foreign trade sector was expected to continue to exert\nsome drag on economic growth, but the members saw this as likely to\nlessen as an anticipated gradual pickup in economic activity among key\ntrading partners bolstered demand for U.S. exports while imports were\nrestrained by a projected moderation in the growth of U.S. domestic\ndemand. In the view of one member, the export sector would tend to\nsustain and perhaps become an important stimulus to growth in the\nUnited States as earlier declines in the dollar, taken in conjunction\nwith technological improvements and higher product quality, enhanced\nthe competitiveness of U.S. exports.\n\nIn their discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, the\nmembers noted that broad measures of inflation remained subdued and\nincreases in labor costs had been moderate. Nevertheless, they\ncontinued to be concerned that inflation could begin to rise if growth\nin excess of potential were to persist and margins of unutilized\nproduction resources were to shrink further, or even disappear.\nProduction already had reached capacity limits in a number of\nindustries, including motor vehicles and steel, and prices of some raw\nmaterials and intermediate goods had risen substantially over the past\nyear. Ongoing efforts to expand production capacity through\nproductivity-enhancing investment and the hiring of additional workers\nwere likely to be of some help in meeting growing demands, but an\nincreasing number of contacts were reporting that business firms were\ntaking advantage of opportunities to adjust prices upward. There also\nwere indications of shortages of qualified workers in some labor\nmarkets or industries, but to date there were only limited signs of\nupward wage pressures and these did not seem to signal a near-term\nemergence of general upward cost pressures on prices. Indeed, even\nwith sales strong, many business contacts were reporting that intense\ncompetition, in part from imports, was curbing or negating efforts to\nraise prices. Firms were continuing to look primarily to improvements\nin productivity and quality to bolster their profit margins, although\nthere also were reports that price discounting was lessening and that\nsales promotions were becoming less frequent. Price and wage\npressures were most clearly evident and widespread in the construction\nindustry, where resource constraints appeared to be most pronounced.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the\nperiod until the meeting in early July, the members favored prompt\nfurther action to remove much of the remaining accommodation in the\nstance of monetary policy, at least as measured by real short-term\ninterest rates. Many members commented that the expansion was on a\nsolid and self-sustaining basis and appeared to have more underlying\nstrength than they had foreseen earlier. The stimulative effects of\nan expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent--especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer\nspending on housing, motor vehicles, and other consumer durables. At\nthe same time, the constraints on economic expansion that had been\nassociated with business restructuring activities, widespread efforts\nto strengthen balance sheets, and other retarding forces had\ndiminished considerably. The financial health of the banking system\nwas greatly improved, and banking institutions had evidenced a growing\nwillingness to make new loans. Moreover, the demand for bank loans,\nwhich had been sluggish for several years, now appeared to be on the\nrise. While a series of small steps earlier this year had already\nreduced the degree of accommodation in monetary policy and inflation\nwas subdued for the time being, the members were concerned that\ncontinued policy accommodation could be expected to lead before long\nto growing pressures on production resources and to a fresh outbreak\nof inflation.\n\nIn the circumstances, all the members agreed that a further\ntightening action was needed at this point; and, in order to better\nassure that the remaining degree of policy accommodation had been\nlargely removed, the adjustment should fully reflect the 1/2\npercentage point increase in the discount rate that the Board of\nGovernors was expected to approve later in the day. The actions taken\nearlier in the year had been modest in size because of concerns that\nmore aggressive steps might generate substantial uncertainty and undue\ndisruptions in financial markets, with adverse consequences for the\neconomy. Even though financial markets remained volatile, speculative\nsentiment and holdings seemed to have been reduced to a marked extent,\nand financial markets appeared to be in a much better position to\nabsorb needed policy adjustments. Accordingly, a stronger action\nprobably would not produce an unduly adverse market response and could\nwell have a settling effect on the markets. A number of members\ncautioned that the Committee could not be sure that today's policy\nactions, along with those implemented earlier this year, had produced\na policy stance that would foster economic growth at a sustainable,\nnon-inflationary pace. Thus, the Committee would have to remain alert\nto economic and financial developments that might signal the need for\nfurther tightening.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting\nadjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, all but one of the\nmembers indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive.\nSymmetry would be consistent with a judgment that further policy\nadjustment likely would not be needed during the intermeeting period\nahead and, in particular, that additional tightening would not be\ntriggered unless inflation pressures greater than those currently\nanticipated were to emerge. The adoption of a symmetric directive\nwould not preclude an intermeeting consultation and possible\nadjustment by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee if such were\nwarranted by intermeeting developments. One member expressed a\npreference for an asymmetric directive. In his view, a symmetric\ndirective might be mistakenly interpreted both in the United States\nand abroad as a signal that the Committee believed that policy\nneutrality definitely had been achieved and that there was no need to\nallow for the possibility of further tightening.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all\nthe members indicated they could support a directive that called for\nincreasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that\ndid not include a presumption about the likely direction of any\nadjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability\nand sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to\neconomic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided\nthat slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff\nanalysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat economic activity has expanded substantially on\nbalance thus far in 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment\nincreased sharply in March and April, in part\nreflecting a rebound in sectors affected by severe\nwinter weather; the civilian unemployment rate fell\nslightly further in April, to 6.4 percent. Industrial\nproduction was up appreciably in April after a strong\nrise over the previous two quarters. Advance data on\nretail sales indicate a decline in April, after very\nlarge increases in February and March. Housing starts\nfell slightly in April but remained well above the\ndepressed winter pace. Orders for nondefense capital\ngoods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending\non business equipment, while nonresidential building\nhas shown some recovery after severe weather disrupted\nconstruction during January and February. The nominal\ndeficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened on\naverage in January and February from the fourth-quarter\nrate. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and\nproducer prices remained moderate through April, though\nprices of industrial materials continued to rise.\n\nMarket interest rates have posted large additional\nincreases since the Committee meeting on March 22,\n1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies declined somewhat further on balance over\nthe intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 and M3 picked up on average in March\nand April; for the year through April, M2 expanded at a\nrate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994\nand M3 at a pace somewhat above the bottom of its\nrange. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded\nat a moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its\nmeeting in February established ranges for growth of M2\nand M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the\nfourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that\ndevelopments contributing to unusual velocity increases\ncould persist during the year and that money growth\nwithin these ranges would be consistent with its broad\npolicy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8\npercent for the year. The behavior of the monetary\naggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light\nof progress toward price level stability, movements in\ntheir velocities, and developments in the economy and\nfinancial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions,\ntaking account of a possible increase in the discount\nrate. In the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, slightly greater\nreserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nmight be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,\nLaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be\nheld on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 5-6, 1994.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn Secretary\n\nFOMC"
