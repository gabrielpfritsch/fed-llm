There were no open\nmarket operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in\nthe period since the previous meeting, and thus no vote was required\nof the Committee.\n\nBy unanimous vote the Committee amended the Authorization for\nForeign Currency Operations to add the euro to the list of foreign\ncurrencies in which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is authorized\nto conduct open market operations. The Desk's holdings of German\nmarks will automatically be converted to euros when that currency is\nintroduced on January 1, 1999.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period November\n17, 1998, through December 21, 1998. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to the economic and financial\noutlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomy had continued to expand at a brisk pace in recent months.\nDomestic final demand had remained robust, and production and\nemployment had recorded further solid gains. Trends in various\nmeasures of wages and prices had been mixed in recent months.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose strongly in November after\nrecording reduced increases in September and October. Job gains were\nwidespread in November; hiring in the services industries remained\nbrisk, construction payrolls surged further, and retail employment\nrebounded after a lackluster rise in October. In sharp contrast to\nthe general job picture, employment in manufacturing continued to\ndrop. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in November.\n\nTotal industrial production declined somewhat in November in\nassociation with a weather-related drop in utilities output and\npersisting weakness in mining activity. Manufacturing output was\nunchanged in November after a considerable increase in October.\nProduction in high-tech industries recorded large gains over the\nOctober-November period, the output of construction supplies climbed\nrapidly, and consumer goods manufacture expanded briskly. Elsewhere,\nproduction of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged on balance over\nthe two months and materials output continued to decline, with the\niron and steel industry registering particularly large decreases. The\nutilization of manufacturing capacity dropped over the October-\nNovember period to its lowest level in more than five years.\n\nStrength in consumer spending persisted in October and\nNovember, with retail sales rising sharply in both months. Increases\nin sales of motor vehicles and other durable goods were particularly\nlarge, but expenditures for nondurable goods also recorded sizable\nadvances. Supported by continuing gains in disposable income and the\nrebound in the stock market, consumer confidence remained at a\nrelatively favorable level, though noticeably below the peak reached\nearlier in the year.\n\nThe residential housing sector continued to surge, as single-\nfamily housing starts registered another strong advance in November\nand sales of new homes remained at a very high level. Unseasonably\nfavorable weather over much of the country evidently contributed to\nthat performance. Nonetheless, the low level of mortgage rates and a\nrecord high in an index of consumer assessments of homebuying\nconditions in November suggested that strength in single-family\nhousing might continue for a time. Multifamily housing starts in\nOctober and November were slightly above the average for earlier in\nthe year, and permits for new projects had been rising recently.\n\nBusiness fixed investment appeared to have rebounded from a\nsmall decrease in the third quarter that had been associated in part\nwith a strike-related drop in business purchases of motor vehicles and\npersisting weakness in nonresidential construction. Shipments of\noffice and computing equipment rose sharply in October after having\ndeclined for two months, and a sizable backlog of orders for\ncommunications equipment suggested that the downturn in shipments in\nOctober after a September surge would be shortlived. In addition,\noutlays for heavy trucks reached record levels and expenditures for\naircraft were well maintained. In the nonresidential sector, building\nactivity remained soft in October. Office construction picked up\nfurther in response to falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs,\nbut other building activity continued sluggish, and available data on\nnew contracts pointed to persisting weakness.\n\nBusiness inventory accumulation slowed appreciably in October\nafter a sizable rise in the third quarter. In manufacturing, however,\nthe pace of stockbuilding picked up in October from a slow rate in the\nthird quarter, and the stock-shipments ratio remained in the upper\nportion of its narrow range over the past year. In the wholesale\nsector, inventories declined somewhat in October following a large\nincrease in the third quarter; much of the reduction was in farm\nproducts. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector was\nstill at the top of its range over the past year. Retail inventory\naccumulation in October was near the modest pace of the third quarter,\nand the inventory-sales ratio was slightly below its range over the\npreceding twelve months.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in\nOctober was little changed from its September level but was slightly\nsmaller than its average for the third quarter. The value of exports\nwas up considerably in October from its third-quarter average; the\nlargest gains were in machinery, agricultural products, and industrial\nsupplies. The value of imports also rose in October. The rise in\nimports was spread across all major trade categories, with the largest\nincreases being in capital goods and oil. The limited information\navailable for the fourth quarter suggested that the Japanese economy\nremained mired in recession and that the pace of economic growth in\nmost of the other major industrial countries was slowing. Activity in\nmost of the Asian developing economies remained depressed, though\nthere were signs that activity in some was nearing a trough and that\ngrowth in China and Taiwan had picked up somewhat. In contrast,\neconomic conditions in most Latin American economies had worsened\nconsiderably in recent months.\n\nConsumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with\nboth the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items\nrising at the same relatively low rates as in October. For the twelve\nmonths ended in November, the increase in core consumer prices was a\nlittle higher than in the previous twelve-month period, reflecting\nslightly bigger advances in the prices of both commodities and\nservices. A similar pattern was evident in producer prices of\nfinished goods other than food and energy; core producer prices\ncontinued to rise at a low rate in November, and the increase in these\nprices in the twelve months ended in November was somewhat larger than\nin the previous twelve-month period. In contrast, prices for crude\nand intermediate materials continued their downward trend in both the\nOctober-November period and the twelve months ended in November.\nGrowth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory\nworkers had slowed over recent months to a modest rate in October and\nNovember. While the deceleration in hourly earnings was relatively\nwidespread across industries, and most pronounced in manufacturing,\nwages continued to accelerate in the services industries and in\nfinance, insurance, and real estate.\n\nAt its meeting on November 17, 1998, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets\nthat were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in\nthe federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. The\nCommittee also decided that moving to a symmetric directive would be\nappropriate, given that further easing likely would not be needed over\nthe months ahead unless unexpected developments were to point toward a\nmore substantial weakening in the growth of economic activity or to\nless inflation than was currently anticipated. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nsome moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.\n\nOpen market operations immediately after the meeting were\ndirected toward implementing the desired slight easing in the degree\nof pressure on reserve positions, and through the remainder of the\nintermeeting period the Manager sought to maintain that easier stance.\nThe federal funds rate remained very close to its intended lower level\non average, and most other short-term market rates registered small\nmixed changes. Longer-term Treasury rates declined somewhat in\nresponse to a weaker outlook for foreign economic activity and the\npotential damping effect of lower commodity prices on inflation.\nShare prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile but posted\nsubstantial increases on balance over the intermeeting period.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar fell slightly over the intermeeting period in relation to other\nmajor currencies and also in terms of an index of the currencies of\nother countries that are important trading partners of the United\nStates. Concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. markets to financial\ndifficulties in Brazil and uncertainty generated by the impeachment\nproceedings were said to weigh on the dollar at times. The dollar's\nlarger decline against the Japanese yen than against the German mark\nand other European currencies may have stemmed from a disparity in\ninterest rate movements in those countries; long-term interest rates\nrose in Japan, partly in anticipation of heightened financing\nrequirements associated with further fiscal stimulus, while European\ninterest rates fell in response to cuts in official interest rates and\nweaker-than-expected economic data. Financial conditions affecting\nemerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the\nCommittee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that\ntrend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to\nreject a key fiscal reform measure.\n\nM2 and M3 had continued to expand rapidly in recent months,\nalthough incoming data indicated that growth was slowing somewhat in\nDecember. The continued strength of M2 in November reflected the\nreduction in its opportunity cost as a result of recent easings of\nmonetary policy, greater growth of liquid deposits in association with\nheavy mortgage refinancing activity, and brisk demand for U.S.\ncurrency both at home and abroad. M3 growth was bolstered by further\nlarge flows into institution-only money market funds and additional RP\nfinancing in association with hefty acquisitions of securities by\nbanks. For the year through November, both aggregates rose at rates\nwell above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt had expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat above the middle\nof its range. Continued paydowns of debt by the federal government\nwere more than offset by appreciable growth of private demands for\ncredit to finance strong spending on durable goods, housing, and\nbusiness investment, as well as merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to\nconsiderable slowing in the expansion of economic activity in the year\nahead to a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's\npotential. However, the expansion was expected to pick up later to a\nrate more in line with that potential. Subdued expansion of foreign\neconomic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place\ncontinuing, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S.\nexports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of\nimports for domestic products. In addition, growth in private final\ndemand would be restrained to some extent by the tighter terms and\nconditions that were now being imposed by many types of lenders, by\nthe anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from\nearlier large increases in equity prices, and by the buildup of stocks\nof consumer durables, housing units, and business capital goods.\nPressures on labor resources were likely to ease slightly as the\nexpansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected\nto rise noticeably over the year ahead, largely in association with a\npartial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic conditions, members commented that moderate growth at a pace\nclose to the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation for\nthe year ahead. The members recognized, however, that such a\nprojection was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in\nboth directions. On the upside, they emphasized the marked resilience\nand persisting strength of private domestic demand, which had kept the\neconomy expanding at a faster pace than most had anticipated. In\naddition, members commented that domestic financial conditions,\nincluding the rebound in stock market prices, currently were\nsupportive of further expansion in aggregate demand, and in that\nregard several noted the continued rapid growth of the broad monetary\naggregates. Still, domestic financial markets remained unusually\nsensitive and subject to relatively pronounced adjustments to\nunanticipated developments that could have substantial effects on\nconfidence and economic activity. The external sector continued to\nrepresent a major source of downside risk; the economies of several\nindustrial countries seemed to be weakening, and the outlook for\nseveral key emerging market economies remained in doubt, with a\nfurther loss of confidence and contagion from the latter a continuing\nthreat. With regard to the outlook for inflation, members reported\nthat labor markets were extraordinarily tight across the nation, but\nthey saw only limited evidence of accelerating wage increases and\nlittle or no evidence of rising inflation in broad measures of prices.\nSeveral commented, however, that the risks of inflation appeared to be\ntilted to the upside, given the continuing strength of the domestic\nexpansion and accommodative financial conditions.\n\nIn their review of developments in various parts of the\ncountry and major industries, members referred to widespread evidence\nof high levels and strong growth of overall domestic production and\ndemand, but also to the continued retarding effects of the foreign\ntrade sector on agriculture and manufacturing and extractive\nindustries. Growth in consumer spending was expected to moderate over\ncoming quarters from a very robust pace. Factors contributing to this\nassessment included expectations of somewhat slower growth in\nemployment and incomes and the prospect that increases in financial\nwealth would moderate or even end at some point. Members also\nreferred to the possibility that the very low saving rate would tend\nto limit increases in consumer spending, but they noted that high\nlevels of consumer confidence and wealth along with low interest rates\nshould help to sustain at least moderate growth in coming quarters.\n\nForecasts of business investment spending pointed to\nappreciable deceleration in the year ahead after very rapid increases\nin recent years. Among the factors cited in support of a slowing\nuptrend were the anticipated slower growth in overall demand and the\nlarge cumulative buildup of business capital that had resulted in\ncomparatively subdued pressures on capacity. Forecasts of reduced\ngrowth in business expenditures tended to be supported by anecdotal\nreports that many business firms were planning to trim their capital\noutlays during the year ahead. Perhaps the slower growth in corporate\nearnings, which had been evident since earlier in the year, and\nreduced cash flows were beginning to exert some restraint on business\ncapital spending. Some members observed, however, that there was\nlittle evidence thus far of any deceleration in business equipment\nexpenditures and that the persistence of tight labor markets should\ncontinue to encourage relatively rapid growth in labor-saving business\ncapital.\n\nHousing activity had displayed a great deal of strength in\nrecent months according to both anecdotal and statistical reports at\nthis meeting. Comparatively warm weather had extended the building\nseason in several areas, while rising incomes and low interest rates\nhad continued to stimulate housing demand. Some retrenchment in\nhousing activity from currently high levels seemed likely over coming\nquarters, given the recent large additions to the stock of housing\nunits and some anticipated deceleration in the growth of jobs and\nincomes.\n\nMembers viewed the foreign sector as likely to exert a\nsmaller negative effect on domestic growth in the year ahead. This\nview was based on the expectation of some stabilization or improvement\nin foreign financial markets and economies. In addition, the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar had been declining in recent months, and\nthe effects of its earlier appreciation on the trade balance would be\nwaning. However, they recognized that net exports could turn out to\nbe substantially more negative than the modal forecast, given the\npersistence of very fragile financial and economic conditions in\nseveral large emerging economies, continued weakness in the Japanese\neconomy, and questions about the prospective strength of economic\nactivity in other industrial nations. As recent experience had\ndemonstrated, a crisis in one or a group of important financial\nmarkets and economies could spread rapidly around the world.\n\nThe outlook for inflation remained favorable, though some\nmembers referred to a number of upside risks going forward. For now,\nhowever, there were few signs of rising price inflation despite\nwidespread indications of very tight labor markets, including reports\nof further tightening in some areas. Indeed, the most recent wage and\nprice data were encouraging. Increases in core measures of prices\nwere limited and sizable declines in oil and commodity prices should\nhelp to moderate inflation going forward, in part by holding down\ninflation expectations. Looking beyond the nearer term, current\nforecasts suggested that moderating growth in overall economic\nactivity would tend to limit pressures on resources and foster\nrelatively subdued price inflation in the context of robust\nproductivity growth and ample industrial capacity. Members who viewed\nthe risks as tilted mainly to the upside commented that the effects of\nthe anticipated reversal of a number of factors--including the\ndeclines in oil and commodity prices and restrained increases in\nhealth care costs--that had tended to hold down overall inflation\nmight turn out to be more pronounced than was currently forecast.\nMoreover, underlying cost and price pressures might emerge more\nrapidly under such circumstances, especially if overall demand\ncontinued to outpace the growth of potential. Some members also\nreferred to the potential inflationary effects over time of the\ncontinuation of quite rapid monetary growth. On balance, however, the\nmembers generally believed that prospective trends in overall economic\nactivity and the persistence of strong competitive pressures in most\nmarkets, including the effects of foreign competition, were likely in\nthe context of now firmly embedded expectations of low inflation to\nmoderate any tendency for price inflation to accelerate over the year\nahead.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod, all the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining an\nunchanged policy stance. The System's policy easing actions since\nlate September had helped to stabilize a dangerously eroding financial\nsituation, and current financial conditions as well as underlying\neconomic trends suggested that needed policy adjustments had been\ncompleted. For now at least, monetary policy appeared to be\nconsistent with the Committee's objectives of fostering sustained low\ninflation and high employment. Accordingly, the Committee had entered\na period where vigilance was called for but where the direction and\ntiming of the next policy move were uncertain.\n\nAs already noted, Committee members saw risks on both sides\nof their forecasts. Persistently strong demand and increasingly\nsupportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the\npossibility of rising inflation pressures. But greater disturbances\nabroad, especially if they were to be transmitted to domestic\nfinancial markets, could exert considerable restraint on the domestic\neconomy. Fortunately, with low inflation, if not price stability,\nincreasingly embedded in expectations, the Committee would have time\nto react to potential inflationary pressures. In the event of\ndownward shocks to the expansion, prompt action to ease policy would\nbe needed, but such shocks could not be anticipated at this point.\nAgainst this background, all the members indicated that they were in\nfavor of retaining the symmetry in the existing directive.\n\nPrior to its vote on policy at this meeting, the Committee\ndiscussed the wording of the operating paragraph of the directive,\nbuilding on progress made toward a consensus at previous meetings.\nAttention focused in part on proposed new wording to describe the\npossibility of intermeeting actions. There were minor differences\nabout specific wording, but no strongly held opinions, and all the\nmembers agreed that the new wording preferred by a majority of the\nmembers represented an improvement over the traditional language in\nthat it would communicate more clearly and succinctly the substance of\nthe Committee's policy decisions. The Committee also discussed\ndeleting the last sentence in the operating paragraph relating to the\noutlook for the growth of money; another paragraph in the directive\nwould continue to report the long-run ranges for such growth that the\nFederal Reserve Act requires the Committee to establish. With regard\nto the proposed deletion, some felt it was desirable for the central\nbank to retain a reference to money in the operating paragraph; more\nmembers supported the deletion on the ground that, as had been\nexplained to the Congress, money growth had not had any special\nsignificance for some time in the formulation of monetary policy owing\nto often unexplained and unexpected changes in velocity. The\nrewording of the sentence on symmetry and the deletion of the sentence\non money were not intended to imply any change in policy or the\nCommittee's approach to policy or its decisionmaking.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers supported a reworded directive that called for maintaining\nconditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged\nfederal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and did not contain any bias\nwith respect to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period.\n\nThe Committee then voted to authorize and direct the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to\nexecute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the\nfollowing domestic policy directive:\n\nMost short-term interest rates have changed little\non balance since the meeting on November 17, but longer-\nterm rates have declined somewhat. Share prices in\nequity markets have remained volatile and have posted\nsizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of\nthe dollar has declined slightly over the period in\nrelation to other major currencies and in terms of an\nindex of the currencies of other countries that are\nimportant trading partners of the United States.\n\nM2 and M3 have posted very large increases in recent\nmonths. For the year through November, both aggregates\nrose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent\nmonths at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting\non June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in\nFebruary for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2\nto 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\nquarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998. The range\nfor growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was\nmaintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1999, the\nCommittee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same\nranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth\nquarter of 1999. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nTo promote the Committee's long-run objectives of\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, the\nCommittee in the immediate future seeks conditions in\nreserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal\nfunds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent. In\nview of the evidence currently available, the Committee\nbelieves that prospective developments are equally likely\nto warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds\nrate operating objective during the intermeeting period.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Jordan,\nKelley, Meyer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Poole, and\nMs. Rivlin.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nThe members also discussed various issues relating to the\ntiming and manner of releasing information about the Committee's\npolicy decisions. A range of views was expressed, as at earlier\nmeetings, on the desirability of releasing a statement routinely not\nonly after those meetings at which there was a change in the stance of\npolicy but also after meetings where the Committee altered its view of\nthe direction of possible policy actions during the intermeeting\nperiod. Members who favored more announcements believed that such\ndisclosure, by providing more information on the Committee's views of\nthe risks in the economic outlook, generally would allow financial\nmarket prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of\nmonetary policy. However, other members were concerned that such\nannouncements often would provoke market reactions. As a consequence,\nthe Committee would become less willing to change the symmetry in the\ndirective, and a policy of immediate release might therefore have\nadverse repercussions on the Committee's decision-making.\nNonetheless, the members decided to implement the previously stated\npolicy of releasing, on an infrequent basis, an announcement\nimmediately after certain FOMC meetings when the stance of monetary\npolicy remained unchanged. Specifically, the Committee would do so on\nthose occasions when it wanted to communicate to the public a major\nshift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction\nof future policy. Such announcements would not be made after every\nchange in the symmetry of the directive, but only when it seemed\nimportant for the public to be aware of an important shift in the\nmembers' views. On the basis of experience with such announcements,\nthe Committee would evaluate later whether further changes in its\napproach to disclosures would be desirable.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday-Wednesday, February 2-3, 1999.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:55 p.m."
