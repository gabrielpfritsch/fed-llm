There\nwere no open market transactions in foreign currencies for System\naccount since that meeting, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period August 19,\n1997, through September 29, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had expanded briskly further in the third quarter.\nThe expansion was paced by robust growth in consumer spending and\nsubstantial further increases in business investment expenditures.\nHousing demand seemed to have been well maintained over the summer.\nEmployment and production had risen considerably further since\nmidyear. Despite widespread indications of tight labor markets,\nincreases in labor compensation had been moderate in recent months,\nand price inflation had remained subdued.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially over\nJuly and August despite the retarding effects of a work stoppage at a\nmajor package shipping firm. Aggregate weekly hours of production or\nnonsupervisory workers were considerably above their second-quarter\naverage over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.9\npercent in August, was marginally above its low for the current\neconomic expansion.\n\nIndustrial production increased considerably in July and\nAugust, extending a relatively brisk advance over the first half of\nthe year. The output of business equipment rose strongly over the two\nmonths, with sizable gains in all major categories, and the output of\nconsumer nondurables turned up after having displayed some weakness in\nearlier months of the year. The production of consumer durables also\nincreased on balance over the two months. After rising somewhat in\nother recent months, the utilization of total manufacturing capacity\nwas up appreciably in August, reaching its highest level since the\nspring of 1995.\n\nRetail sales were up substantially over the summer after\nhaving edged lower during the spring. The upturn in recent months\nincluded a rebound in sales at automotive dealers following some\nweakness in earlier months. Sales at non-auto durable and at\nnondurable goods stores also strengthened after having declined on\nbalance during the second quarter. The pickup in consumer spending\noccurred against a backdrop of further strong gains in incomes and\nhousehold net worth that, according to recent surveys, had fostered\nhigh levels of consumer confidence. In addition, credit continued to\nbe readily available to most consumers. Total private housing starts\nand building permits declined in August to levels somewhat below their\naverages in earlier months of the year, but data on overall home sales\nand builder ratings of new home sales continued to suggest that demand\nfor single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.\n\nReal business fixed investment had remained on a steep\nuptrend since midyear, with exceptional ongoing demand for computers\nand communications equipment and relatively robust demand in other\ncategories of business equipment as well. Nonresidential construction\nactivity appeared to have rebounded somewhat in late spring and early\nsummer after having declined moderately earlier in the year. While\nnew construction contracts displayed little trend, favorable\nconditions for nonresidential construction were suggested by low\nvacancy rates, rising prices for commercial real estate, and a\nwidespread availability of financing.\n\nThe accumulation of nonfarm business inventories slowed\nsubstantially in July (latest data) from its average pace in the\nsecond quarter. Inventory investment in manufacturing was only a bit\nbelow its pace in the second quarter, but the inventory-shipments\nratio for the sector remained at a very low level. In wholesale\ntrade, stocks fell after a sharp buildup in June, and the stock-sales\nratio for this sector was at the middle of its relatively low range\nfor the past year. At the retail level, a rise in inventories in July\nabout matched that in June and the inventory-sales ratio for the\nsector also was near the middle of its range for the past year.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports\nand a rise in imports. The lower exports of goods and services\nwere associated with decreases in most trade categories and left total\nexports slightly below their relatively high level of the second\nquarter. The July increase in imports also was spread among nearly\nall trade categories and brought total imports of goods and services\nto a level somewhat above the average for the second quarter. The\navailable information suggested that economic activity expanded\nfurther in recent months in all the major foreign industrial countries\nexcept Japan. Growth remained relatively robust in Canada and the\nUnited Kingdom, and activity apparently picked up in France and\nGermany after having been sluggish early in the year. Economic\nactivity in Japan declined appreciably in the second quarter, and more\nrecent information provided little clear evidence of subsequent\nstrength.\n\nPrice inflation has remained subdued. Consumer price inflation\npicked up slightly in July and August from a slow rate of\nincrease in each of the previous four months; reduced but still\nappreciable increases in food prices contributed to the larger advance\nin both months and a sizable rise in energy prices held up the\nconsumer price index in August. At the producer level, the price\nindex for finished goods rose moderately in August after having fallen\nfor seven consecutive months; the August rise largely reflected a jump\nin energy prices. Over the twelve months ended in August, consumer\nprices were up considerably less than in the previous twelve months,\nwhile producer prices of finished goods were down slightly after\nhaving increased moderately in the previous twelve months. The\nbehavior of these broad measures of inflation excluding the effects of\nfood and energy prices also was favorable over the year ended in\nAugust, albeit slightly less so. Average hourly earnings of\nproduction and nonsupervisory workers picked up in August from a much\nreduced pace in July; the rise in such earnings over the twelve months\nended in July was slightly above that in the previous twelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on August 19, 1997, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging\nabout 5-1/2 percent. The directive included a bias toward the\npossible firming of reserve conditions and a somewhat higher federal\nfunds rate to reflect a consensus among the members that the economic\nrisks remained biased toward higher inflation. Although the members\ndid not see a high probability that likely developments would warrant\na tightening of policy during the intermeeting interval, they\ncontinued to anticipate that the next policy move was more likely to\nbe in the direction of some firming than toward some easing. The\nreserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected\nto be consistent with some slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to more\nmoderate rates over coming months.\n\nOpen market operations were directed throughout the inter-meeting\nperiod toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on\nreserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged just slightly\nabove the Committee's intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other\ninterest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the\nperiod. Rates on longer-term obligations were down somewhat on\nbalance, apparently reflecting a reassessment of the outlook for\ninflation by some market participants in the light of unexpectedly low\ninflation and other statistics released during the latter part of the\nperiod. The downward movement in long-term interest rates resulted in\nsome further flattening of the slope of the yield curve and appeared\nconsistent with an interpretation that market participants saw little\nlikelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months.\nShare prices in equity markets continued to display considerable\nvolatility but increased appreciably further on balance over the\nintermeeting interval.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the dollar experienced mixed\nchanges in relation to major foreign currencies, largely reflecting\ndiverging economic developments abroad. On balance, the dollar's\ntrade-weighted value in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined\nsomewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar was down considerably\nagainst the mark as data suggesting a pickup in German economic\nactivity and inflation led to market speculation concerning a possible\nincrease in short-term German interest rates. The dollar also\nregistered sizable declines over the period against a number of other\nEuropean currencies. On the other hand, the dollar rose appreciably\nin relation to the Japanese yen, which came under selling pressure\nagainst the background of continuing sluggish economic conditions in\nJapan, persistent problems in its financial system, and concerns about\nthe potential effect on Japan of the recent depreciations of Southeast\nAsian currencies. The dollar also strengthened somewhat in terms of\nthe British pound, in part as a result of some indications that\neconomic activity in the United Kingdom was not as strong as expected\nand the sizable declines that had occurred recently in that nation's\nlong-term interest rates.\n\nM2 expanded at a rapid pace in August and continued to grow\nat a still robust though diminished rate in September according to the\nlimited data available for that month. The strength of M2 and also\nthat of M3 was related at least in part to changes in the allocation\nof financial assets and liabilities rather than to the growth in\nspending; in particular, the volatility in the stock market evidently\nfostered a redirection of funds to M2 assets, among others, and\nincluded heavy inflows to the money market funds component of M2. For\nthe year through August, M2 rose at a rate somewhat above the upper\nbound of the Committee's range. M3 grew at an exceptionally rapid\nrate over the summer months, with only few signs of moderation in\nSeptember according to the partial data available for that month.\nApart from the strength in its M2 components, the increase in this\naggregate reflected bank substitution of large time deposits for\nforeign borrowings to finance credit growth and also reflected\nsubstantial inflows to institution-only money funds. For the year\nthrough August, M3 expanded at a rate well above the upper bound of\nits range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to increase at\na relatively moderate rate in recent months.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe economy would expand at a pace significantly above that anticipated\nearlier for the second half of the year and the early part of\n1998, but economic growth was likely to moderate appreciably to a more\nsustainable rate later. In the near term, business fixed investment\nappeared to be providing surprisingly strong impetus to income growth,\nand rising levels of wealth were stimulating robust consumer demand.\nWith sales so strong, the downward adjustment in inventory investment\nthat had been anticipated in the previous staff forecast seemed likely\nto occur more gradually. The projected strength in aggregate demand\nappeared likely to intensify pressures on resources and lead to some\npickup in inflation. Less accommodative financial market conditions\nwere anticipated to damp these tendencies over time.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on the continued remarkable\nperformance of the economy. Strength in consumer spending and further\nacceleration in capital investment sparked faster-than-expected growth\nin the third quarter, and relatively brisk economic expansion seemed\nto be in prospect for a period ahead in the context of very positive\nbusiness and consumer sentiment, strong demands for capital goods, and\nfavorable financial conditions. The rate of expansion might\nsubsequently be expected to slow as stocks of business capital and\nconsumer durable goods built up relative to sales and incomes,\ninventory investment moderated somewhat, and the recent strength of\nthe dollar began to exert a drag on exports. It was an open question,\nhowever, as to whether these influences would be sufficient to slow\nthe growth of demands for goods and services to a more sustainable\npace, and many members suggested that the risks to the forecast were\non the side of increases in final demands that would press more\nintensely against the available resources. Despite high levels of\nresource utilization, inflation and inflationary expectations had\nremained subdued to date, reflecting to some extent special influences\nlike the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Moreover,\nsizable gains in productivity combined with moderate increases in\nwages and salaries seemed to have contributed to keeping unit labor\ncosts and prices under control. However, the growing tightness in\nlabor markets in many parts of the country was being accompanied by\nsome signs of rising pressures on labor compensation, including the\nuse of special bonuses and other innovative compensation initiatives\nthat are not included in the usual statistical measures of labor\ncosts. In the circumstances, members saw a risk of added wage and\nprice inflation if economic activity did not slow to a more\nsustainable pace consistent at a minimum with no further appreciable\nincrease in labor utilization rates.\n\nWith regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors,\nmembers took note of the rebound in consumer expenditures after a\nsluggish second quarter. Solid gains in employment, incomes, and\nhousehold net worth were seen as sustaining further robust expansion\nin consumer spending. In addition, members anticipated that continued\nfurther rapid expansion in investment expenditures by business firms\nfor equipment and structures would provide strong underlying support\nfor the economic expansion. High rates of return on investments in\nequipment, particularly for computers and communications equipment\nwhere prices were falling rapidly, coupled with ready financing from\nboth internal cash flows and external sources were inducing firms to\nundertake large investment programs. Such investments would expand\ncapacity, improve productivity, and lower costs of production.\nAnecdotal reports suggested a mixed picture in nonresidential real\nestate markets. In much of the country, commercial and office\nvacancies were declining from already low levels and lease rates were\nrising. Shortages of construction workers were said to be holding\nback construction in some areas, but in other parts of the country\nthere were indications of some moderation in construction activity and\nof emerging overcapacity in some markets. The ready availability of\nfinancing was a supportive factor in the outlook for nonresidential\nconstruction.\n\nA gradual decline in housing activity was expected to exert\nonly mild restraint on the increase of economic activity. Solid job\nand income growth, the high level of household wealth, and the low\ncash-flow burden of homeownership would continue to provide good\nsupport for housing demand. In this regard, recent statistical and\nanecdotal information indicated that home sales were holding up well\nacross the country, although higher-priced homes appeared to be\nselling relatively slowly in some areas.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation,\nmembers discussed the relative absence of price pressures in an\nenvironment of increasingly tight labor markets across the country and\nrising levels of manufacturing capacity utilization. In labor\nmarkets, costs were increasing much less than would have been expected\non the basis of previous experience under similarly tight conditions.\nAmong the possible explanations for this outcome were persisting\nconcerns about job security; the muted rise in worker benefits,\nnotably health care; and the increasing use by employers of more\nflexible and innovative means to attract and retain workers that were\nin high demand. Moreover, it was suggested that, at least in\nmanufacturing, productivity had risen unusually rapidly of late,\nallowing corporations to hold the line on prices despite increases in\nlabor costs. While the underlying reasons for the favorable inflation\ntrends were not entirely clear, the members noted that, in addition to\nsubdued increases in labor costs, the appreciation of the dollar and\nthe relatively sluggish performance of many foreign industrial\neconomies seemed to be contributing to the better-than-expected\ninflation performance by holding down prices in world commodity\nmarkets and prices of imported goods more generally. These\ndevelopments also added to competitive pressures on businesses, which\ntogether with customer resistance were making it very difficult for\nfirms to raise prices to reflect their higher costs.\n\nThe members commented that while few signs of rising price\ninflation had surfaced, the widespread tautness of labor markets and\nthe emergence of scattered indications of increased pressure on wages\nand other labor costs were cause for concern. Anecdotal reports\nsuggested that increases in health care costs were likely to turn up,\nand there were indications that fears about job security might be\ndiminishing and that workers were becoming less reluctant to leave\ntheir jobs before finding better ones. In addition, businesses were\nreporting increasing difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified\nworkers. Growth in labor demand had been outpacing sustainable\nincreases in labor supply; these reports suggested that the risk of an\nacceleration in labor compensation was rising.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged policy stance, but several also indicated that economic\ndevelopments could well require a tightening of policy in the\nrelatively near future. Members observed in this regard that some\nfactors that had contributed to a currently subdued rate of inflation,\nnotably the appreciation of the dollar, damped wage demands, and\nrelatively limited increases in the cost of health benefits, were not\nlikely to continue to exert the same restraining influence. Moreover,\nfinal demands had been unexpectedly strong, with economic activity and\nthe associated demand for labor expanding at an unsustainable pace for\nsome time, and it was unclear whether without policy action overall\ndemands would moderate sufficiently to avoid increasing pressures on\nresources. In the circumstances, the risks to the economy appeared to\nbe strongly tilted toward rising inflation whose emergence would in\nturn threaten the sustainability of the expansion. Several members\nemphasized in this regard that a tightening move could be most\neffective if it were implemented preemptively, before inflation had\ntime to gather upward momentum and become embedded in financial asset\nprices and in business and consumer decisionmaking.\n\nThere were, nonetheless, a number of reasons for delaying a\ntightening of policy. The behavior of inflation had been unexpectedly\nbenign for an extended period of time for reasons that were not fully\nunderstood. Forecasts of an upturn in inflation were therefore\nsubject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the expansion of\neconomic activity could still slow to a noninflationary pace. Members\nalso commented that a policy tightening was not anticipated at this\ntime and such an action might therefore have unintended adverse\neffects on financial markets. Members recognized that from the\nstandpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary\npolicy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive. Several\nnoted, however, that credit from a wide variety of lenders appeared to\nbe amply available in financial markets on favorable terms, perhaps\noverly so in present circumstances, and some also noted that the\nstrength in the broad measures of money in recent months suggested\nthat policy was not restraining liquidity or financial conditions more\ngenerally. In the course of the Committee's discussion of these\ndiverging considerations, a consensus emerged for maintaining a steady\npolicy course at this time, but members also expressed the need for a\nheightened degree of vigilance as they continued to assess ongoing\ndevelopments for signs that inflation might intensify in the future.\n\nIn their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during\nthe intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they wanted to\nretain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing\nasymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the May\nmeeting. Such a directive was consistent with their view that the\nrisks continued to be biased toward rising inflation and indeed with\nthe view of most members that those risks might have increased.\nAccordingly, while the probability that the incoming information would\nwarrant a tightening move during the intermeeting period might not be\nhigh, the members continued to view the next policy move as more\nlikely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions\nin reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal\nfunds rate of about 5-1/2 percent. All the members also agreed on the\ndesirability of retaining a bias in the directive toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate during\nthe intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a\nsomewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion in M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMost market interest rates are about unchanged on\nbalance since the day before the Committee meeting on\nAugust 19, 1997. Share prices in equity markets have\nincreased considerably over the period, with some stock\nprice indexes reaching new highs. In foreign exchange\nmarkets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms\nof the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance\nover the intermeeting period.\n\nGrowth of M2 appears to have moderated somewhat in\nSeptember from a very rapid pace in August, while\nexpansion of M3 remained very strong in both months. For\nthe year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat\nabove the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at\na rate substantially above the upper bound of its range.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand\nin recent months at a pace near the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on\na tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for\ngrowth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\nto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with some moderation in the\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\n: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow,\nParry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nVotes against this action : None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Wednesday, November 12, 1997.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m."
