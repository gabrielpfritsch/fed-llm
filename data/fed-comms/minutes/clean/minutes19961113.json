There were no open\nmarket transactions in foreign currencies for System account during\nthe period since the meeting on September 24, 1996, and thus no vote\nwas required by the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period September\n24, 1996 through November 12, 1996. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal for\nan additional one-year period of the System's reciprocal currency\n(\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks and the Bank for\nInternational Settlements.

A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\ngrowth of economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter,\nand the limited information available for the period since then\nindicated continued moderate expansion. A marked softening in the\ngrowth of consumer expenditures accounted for much of the slowing in\nthe third quarter, but slight weakening in housing demand, net\nexports, and federal purchases of goods and services also exerted\nretarding effects. On the other hand, a sizable increase in inventory\ninvestment, greater strength in business demand for durable equipment,\nand an upturn in spending on nonresidential construction helped foster\nmoderate further economic growth in the third quarter. Employment\nposted sizable increases over the third quarter and rose substantially\nfurther in October, but on balance the gains were somewhat below those\nrecorded earlier in the year. Industrial production had weakened\nsomewhat recently. Consumer price inflation had picked up this year\nbecause of larger increases in food and energy prices. Increases in\nlabor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, also had\nbeen somewhat larger this year.\n\nPrivate nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in\nOctober after a small rise in September; private payroll growth had\nmoderated on balance since midyear but nevertheless had remained\nsubstantial. In October, job gains were large in services industries;\nconstruction employment registered another moderate gain; and\nmanufacturing payrolls edged up after a sizable September loss. The\ncivilian unemployment rate in October was unchanged at 5.2 percent.\n\nIndustrial production appeared to have declined appreciably\nin October after having grown briskly on balance over earlier months\nof the year. Much of the slackening in October was due to work\nstoppages in the motor vehicles industry, but the output of other\nindustries also apparently decreased slightly on balance. The drop in\nproduction was accompanied by a slight decline in capacity utilization\nin manufacturing.\n\nTotal retail sales rose appreciably in September after having\nchanged little on balance over July and August; for the third quarter\nas a whole, total retail sales edged higher after having expanded\nbriskly in the first half of the year. September sales totals were\nboosted by strong spending at automotive dealers, food stores, and\nnondurable goods outlets. However, expenditures for furniture,\nappliances and other non-auto durable goods fell, and apparel sales\nweakened a little further. Housing starts declined in September from\nthe unusually high level recorded in August and permits moved lower\nfor a second straight month. Home sales were mixed, with sales of new\nhomes well sustained in September while those of existing homes\ncontinued on a downtrend.\n\nGrowth of business fixed investment surged in the third\nquarter. Outlays for durable equipment picked up sharply, and new\norders for business equipment remained on an upward trend. Sales of\ncomputers and communications equipment increased rapidly, but demand\nfor other capital goods was up only slightly during the quarter. In\nthe transportation sector, expenditures on motor vehicles and aircraft\nstrengthened while sales of heavy trucks continued to drift lower.\nSpending on nonresidential structures more than reversed a second-\nquarter decline; however, incoming data on contracts pointed to a\ncontinuation of the pattern of somewhat slower growth recorded thus\nfar in 1996.\n\nThe pace of inventory investment picked up markedly after\nmidyear, but inventory-sales ratios nonetheless remained relatively\nlow. In manufacturing, inventories rose moderately in the third\nquarter, more than offsetting a small rundown in stocks in the\nprevious quarter; stock-shipments ratios for most industries remained\nnear the low end of their recent ranges. In the wholesale sector,\ninventories declined sharply in September after having edged down in\nthe previous two months, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for\nthe sector fell to the low end of its range over recent years. At the\nretail level, substantial inventory accumulation occurred over the\nJuly-August period (latest data). Although stock-sales ratios rose\nslightly, inventories remained relatively well aligned with sales.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nnarrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the\ntwo months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its\naverage rate for the second quarter. Exports declined appreciably\nover the July-August period, with most of the decrease occurring in\nnonmonetary gold and aircraft. Imports rose only marginally on\nbalance over the two months. The limited available information\nsuggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign\nindustrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter.\n\nConsumer price inflation had picked up on balance this year\nas a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices. Over\nAugust and September, however, increases in food prices were offset by\na net decline in energy prices, and overall consumer prices rose more\nmoderately. For the twelve months ended in September, the advance in\nconsumer prices of items other than food and energy was a little\nsmaller than it had been over the previous twelve months. At the\nproducer level, price inflation also was moderate over August and\nSeptember despite appreciable increases in the prices of food and\nenergy items; producer prices of items other than food and energy rose\nconsiderably less over the twelve months ended in September than they\nhad over the previous twelve months. Growth in the employment cost\nindex for private industry workers slowed considerably in the third\nquarter after having trended up over the first two quarters of the\nyear; however, this measure of labor compensation was up slightly over\nthe twelve months ended in September compared with the previous twelve\nmonths. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers were unchanged in October, but the twelve-month rise in this\nindex through October was a bit larger than the increase over the\nprevious twelve months.\n\nAt its meeting on September 24, 1996, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible\nfirming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The\ndirective stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable\nand slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this\ndirective were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2\nand M3 over coming months.\n\nWith incoming information continuing to suggest moderate\neconomic growth and subdued price inflation, open market operations\nduring the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds\nrate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged\npolicy stance. Market participants had anticipated some tightening of\nmonetary policy at the September 24 meeting, and the announcement of\nan unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates,\nwith the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield\ncurve. Interest rates, especially those at intermediate and longer\nmaturities, dropped further over the remainder of the period in\nresponse to information indicating that price and labor cost pressures\nwere lower than market participants had expected. Equity markets\nresponded to the declines in interest rates as well as to favorable\nearnings reports, and most major indexes reached record highs.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated slightly on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. Interest rates in the foreign\nindustrial countries fell somewhat less on average than did U.S.\ninterest rates. The dollar changed little against the German mark and\nmost other major continental European currencies, but it rose against\nthe yen as prospects for a significant supplemental budget package in\nJapan waned in the aftermath of the recent elections in that country.\nThe dollar declined against the pound sterling in response to the\nrelease of favorable data on the U.K. economy as well as an unexpected\nincrease in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate.\n\nM2 grew at a slower pace in September and October than it had\nover earlier months of the year; the weaker expansion resulted from a\ncontinuing rapid runoff in its liquid deposit components.\nNonetheless, M2 was estimated to have grown for the year through\nOctober at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's annual range.\nBy contrast, M3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in September\nand October than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its\nlarge time deposit and other managed liability components to meet\nbusiness demand for bank loans. For the year through October, M3 was\nestimated to have grown at a rate around the top of its annual range.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance\nover recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its\nrange.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\nthe expansion would continue at a rate close to, or perhaps a little\nabove, the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending\nwas projected to rebound in the current quarter and subsequently to\nexpand at a moderate pace in line with the projected increase in\ndisposable income; the favorable effect on household wealth of the\nrise that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of\ncredit for most borrowers were expected to balance continuing consumer\nconcerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining\neffect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to\ndecline slightly further in response to the previous backup in\nresidential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level\nin the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable\ncash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on\nequipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light\nof the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance,\nthe external sector was expected to exert a small restraining\ninfluence on economic activity over the projection period. A slight\ndegree of fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon.\nContinued pressure on resources, especially in labor markets, pointed\nto a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the\nprojection period; however, it was expected that improved supply\nconditions in food and energy markets, as well as planned technical\nchanges, would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to\nthe elevated 1996 rate.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, members commented that most\nrecent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and\ninflation had been favorable. The information on economic activity\nsince the September meeting had confirmed earlier indications of\nappreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to\nthe economy's potential. The outlook remained subject, as usual, to\nconsiderable uncertainty, but many of the members observed that\nunderlying trends in key sectors of the economy along with generally\nsupportive financial conditions seemed consistent with further\nmoderate economic expansion. In this regard, several focused on what\nthey saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of\nconsumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter;\nthe pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer\nterm despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation.\nWith respect to the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that\ndespite widespread indications of tight labor markets, the increase in\nwages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated, and there was\nno broad evidence of rising price inflation. Indeed, many major\nmeasures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993.\nLooking ahead, views differed to some extent regarding the most likely\ncourse for inflation. Several members indicated that, while recent\ndevelopments were encouraging, they continued to see the risks as\ntilted toward some rise, even assuming that the expansion settled into\na pattern of growth near the economy's potential as they anticipated\nand resource utilization remained near current levels; other members\nfelt that the risks surrounding the forecasts for both economic growth\nand price inflation had become more evenly balanced, but more evidence\nwas needed before a firm judgment could be reached.\n\nIn their review of developments in key sectors of the\neconomy, members said that they anticipated a pickup in consumer\nspending from its much reduced rate of growth in the third quarter.\nWhile the factors relating to the prospects for consumer expenditures\ndid not all point toward greater strength, members tended to focus on\nthose favoring an upturn. These included persisting growth in\nemployment and incomes and clearly upbeat consumer sentiment as\nevidenced by recent surveys and anecdotal reports. Financial factors\nalso seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in\nconsumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had\noccurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability\nof credit to most households. Supporting evidence included anecdotal\nreports from retailers in a numbers of areas who were experiencing\nsizable gains in sales and seemed optimistic about the outlook for the\nupcoming holiday season. Among the developments that would tend to\nlimit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of\nconsumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many\nhouseholds. The growth of consumer credit was now exhibiting a\nmoderating trend, possibly pointing to restrained spending by many\nhouseholds because of already heavy debt service burdens and generally\ntightening credit standards for consumer loans. Other negative\nfactors cited in the outlook for consumer expenditures were the\npossibility of a correction in the stock market and the probable\nsatisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer\ndurables. In balancing these conflicting influences, the members\ngenerally concluded that a pickup in the growth of consumer spending\nto a moderate pace was a likely prospect for this critical sector of\nthe economy.\n\nBusiness fixed investment was expected to provide further but\ndiminished impetus to the expansion. This view took account of the\ncontinued availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms\nbut also of expectations of a more moderate growth trend in sales and\nthe substantial buildup that had already occurred in stocks of\nequipment and structures. With regard to the latter, some\noverbuilding of commercial and other structures characterized\nconditions in a number of areas. Nonetheless, members reported\nconsiderable nonresidential building activity in several parts of the\ncountry, and nationwide such activity was expected to help sustain\nmodest growth in overall nonresidential construction in coming\nquarters.\n\nRecent data, supported by anecdotal reports from several\nthough not all parts of the country, suggested that residential\nbuilding activity was slowing somewhat, apparently in lagged response\nto earlier increases in mortgage interest rates. However, in the\ncontext of the partial reversal recently of the previous increases in\nmortgage rates and sustained growth in employment and incomes, the\nhousing sector was viewed as likely to exert only a minor constraint\non overall economic activity over the forecast horizon. Another\nsomewhat negative factor in the outlook for economic activity was the\nprospect of some widening in the nation's trade deficit over the\nprojection period.\n\nFiscal policy currently remained on a mildly restrictive\ncourse, but the range of potential developments was especially wide,\ninjecting an element of considerable uncertainty in the economic\noutlook. Legislation affecting the federal budget could have marked\nbeneficial or adverse effects not only directly on spending and\nincomes but also on business and consumer confidence and financial\nmarkets.\n\nThe growth of nonfarm business inventories in the third\nquarter had exceeded earlier expectations, but members commented that\nthe sizable rise appeared to have been largely voluntary and the\noverall level of inventories was still historically low in relation to\nsales. Against this background, inventory accumulation was likely to\ncontinue but at a slower pace in the current quarter. Beyond the near\nterm, inventory investment was expected to become a more neutral\nfactor in the performance of the economy, given the absence of\nincentives to build stocks relative to sales in a period of moderate\ngrowth in projected demand. The members recognized, however, that the\nprospective behavior of inventories remained subject to substantial\nuncertainties.\n\nIn their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members\nagain focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which\nrising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to\nhigher prices. The statistical and anecdotal information generally\ncontinued to point to tight labor markets and to a somewhat faster\nrise in labor compensation costs this year. Even so, the increases in\nsuch costs were still falling short of those that would have been\nanticipated on the basis of historical experience under similar labor\nmarket conditions. Moreover, the advance in the overall employment\ncost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some\nextent, was appreciably below expectations. At the same time,\nbusiness firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to\ncompensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent\nthat the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence\nof intense competition in most markets. Indeed, with the notable\nexception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation\nas measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease\nmarginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years. Prices\nof farm commodities and industrial materials had declined considerably\nrecently.\n\nDespite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation\nand prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation\ncould not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher\ninflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect. Much would depend,\nof course, on the strength of the economic expansion and the\nassociated degree of pressure on resources, notably in labor markets\nwhich appeared to have comparatively little slack in relation to other\nproducer resources. It was suggested in this regard that restrained\nincreases in labor compensation in comparison with historical\nexperience probably were a transitory phenomenon, though one could not\npredict when a more normal relationship would re-emerge. A related\nconcern was whether the tightness in labor markets would ease\nsufficiently and quickly enough to prevent inflation pressures from\nescalating significantly. Some members mentioned a number of\nfavorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to\nattenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a\nresult of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions\nin markets for energy. Relatively restrained monetary growth in\nrecent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued\ninflationary pressures. Moreover, the view was advanced that recent\ndevelopments in bond markets could be read as suggesting some decrease\nin inflationary expectations. On balance, while the members expressed\nvarying degrees of concern that tight labor markets and attendant\nincreases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation,\nthey agreed that there was little or no evidence of such a development\nat this point and the outlook was far from certain.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, all the members indicated that they could support an\nunchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward restraint\nin the directive. The slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace\nnear the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening\nprice pressures and provided the Committee with a desirable\nopportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the\ncourse of economic activity and inflation. Indeed, to the extent that\ninflation expectations had declined recently, short-term interest\nrates, which had changed little in nominal terms, had edged higher in\nreal terms, implying slightly greater monetary restraint and reducing\nthe odds that inflation would pick up.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, all the members indicated that they could support\na proposal to retain the current bias toward restraint. Several\nviewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that\nthe risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising\ninflation over time. In the circumstances an asymmetric directive\nwould best reflect their views even if, as seemed likely, intermeeting\ndevelopments did not prompt a policy tightening adjustment. Other\nmembers commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be\nviewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary\npressures. They agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature\nin the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately,\nthat the Federal Reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a\na modest upward trajectory in price inflation.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the\nmembers indicated that they supported a directive that called for\nmaintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and\nretaining a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions\nduring the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that\nsomewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly\nlesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting\nperiod. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were\nexpected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and relatively\nstrong expansion in M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMarket interest rates have moved lower since the\nCommittee meeting on September 24, 1996, with the largest\ndeclines occurring in intermediate- and long-term\nmaturities. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-\nweighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting\nperiod.\n\nGrowth of M2 in September and October remained below\nits pace in the first half of the year, while expansion\nof M3 was substantially higher over those two months.\nFor the year through October, M2 is estimated to have\ngrown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's\nannual range, and M3 at a rate around the top of its\nrange. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has\nbeen moderate on balance over recent months and has\nremained in the middle portion of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. The monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained\nat 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 1997 the Committee\nagreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in\n1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,\nmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth\nquarter of 1997. The behavior of the monetary aggregates\nwill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress\ntoward price level stability, movements in their\nvelocities, and developments in the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing\ndegree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context\nof the Committee's long-run objectives for price\nstability and sustainable economic growth, and giving\ncareful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint\nwould or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be\nacceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated\nreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with\nmoderate growth in M2 and relatively strong expansion in\nM3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMcTeer, Meyer, Mses. Phillips, Rivlin, Mr. Stern,\nand Ms. Yellen.\n\nVote against this action: None.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, December 17, 1996.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:25 p.m."
