Altig, Bentley, and Judd, Vice Presidents,\nFederal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, New York,\nand San Francisco respectively\n\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee held on March 31, 1998, were approved.\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets during the period March 31,\n1998, through May 18, 1998. There were no System open market\ntransactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no\nvote was required of the Committee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period March 31,\n1998, through May 18, 1998. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe Manager informed the Committee of his intention to\ndiscuss with market participants proposed changes in the procedures\nfor lending securities from the System Open Market Account. The\nchanges would be intended to adapt the lending program to the evolving\nstructure of the U.S. Treasury securities market. They are designed\nto make System securities lending more effective at helping to relieve\noccasional significant shortages of particular securities, which could\ncause disruptions to the market. In a brief discussion, Committee\nmembers sought clarification of some of the proposed details of the\nnew program and how it would fit with the Federal Reserve's broader\nresponsibilities. Action to amend paragraph 2 of the Authorization\nfor Domestic Open Market Operations would be required at a later date\nwhen the details of the new program had been decided upon after\ndiscussions with market participants.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, and the implementation of monetary policy over the\nintermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial\ninformation available at the time of the meeting and of the\nCommittee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic\npolicy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\neconomy continued to expand rapidly in 1998. Strength in consumption,\nbusiness outlays for durable equipment, and homebuilding boosted\ngrowth in domestic final demand to a very rapid pace in the first\nquarter, and there had been indications of slower expansion since\nthen. However, weakening net exports were exerting a considerable\ndrag on economic growth. Moreover, the extraordinary pace of\ninventory investment thus far this year might foreshadow less robust\nexpansion ahead. Payroll employment remained on a brisk uptrend, but\nindustrial production decelerated sharply after surging in the second\nhalf of last year. Despite indications of persisting pressures on\nemployment costs associated with tight labor markets, consumer price\ninflation remained subdued, importantly reflecting large declines in\nenergy prices.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment registered another large increase\nin April after a small decline in March; these data, along with the\nstill-low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent\nweeks, suggested that labor demand had remained robust thus far in\n1998. Hiring in the trade, finance and real estate, and services\nindustries was brisk in April; employment in construction retraced\npart of an apparently weather-related drop in March. The number of\nmanufacturing jobs declined in April for a second consecutive month.\nThe civilian unemployment rate fell sharply, to 4.3 percent in April,\nafter having averaged around 4-3/4 percent since last November.\n\nIndustrial production rose somewhat over March and April\nafter weakening earlier in the year. Part of the slowdown this year,\nfollowing rapid growth in the second half of last year, was attributable to weakness in utility output associated with unusually warm\nwinter weather across much of the country. More importantly, though,\nmanufacturing output had changed little on balance in recent months.\nIn April, a pickup in the production of business equipment,\nparticularly of information processing equipment, was largely offset\nby further declines in the output of construction supplies, basic\nmetals, and nondurable materials. The production of consumer goods\nwas unchanged. The factory operating rate eased further in April,\nreflecting the continuing brisk expansion in manufacturing facilities\nand slow growth in output.\n\nConsumer spending had remained strong this year in the\ncontext of robust gains in income and household net worth and of very\nfavorable consumer sentiment. Total retail sales rose appreciably in\nApril, boosted by increases in purchases of automobiles and nondurable\ngoods. Housing demand and residential construction activity also\ncontinued to increase at a rapid pace this year. Home sales were at\nvery high levels, reflecting the continuing improvement in housing\naffordability as a result of declining mortgage rates. Although\nhousing starts slipped in April, they remained at an elevated level.\n\nBusiness fixed investment rebounded sharply in the first\nquarter from a small decline in the fourth quarter of 1997. A surge\nin expenditures on producers' durable equipment, notably on computers,\ncommunications equipment, and heavy trucks, more than offset continued\nweakness in outlays for nonresidential structures. While available\nindicators pointed to further substantial gains in equipment purchases\nover coming months, data on construction contracts offered little\nevidence of a pickup in nonresidential construction activity in the\nnear term, even though vacancy rates were declining and office rents\nwere rising.\n\nBusiness inventories increased at a very rapid pace in the\nfirst quarter, but with sales strong, inventory-sales ratios remained\nwithin their ranges over the past year. In manufacturing, stock\naccumulation slowed in March after increasing fairly rapidly in\nJanuary and February. At the wholesale level, inventories rose about\nin line with sales during the quarter, and in the retail sector\ninventories built up at a greatly accelerated pace in the first\nquarter.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in January and February from its average monthly\nrate in the fourth quarter. The value of exports declined considerably in the January-February period, with most of the drop attributable to reduced sales to Asian countries. The decrease in exports was\nconcentrated in agricultural products, industrial supplies, and\nmachinery. The value of imports rose slightly, largely reflecting\nhigher amounts of imported automotive products and higher service\npayments. The available information suggested that economic growth in\ncontinental Europe strengthened in the first quarter, with strong\ndomestic demand apparently offsetting the effects of Asian turmoil on\nforeign trade. Robust domestic demand also continued to buoy the\nCanadian economy. By contrast, economic activity in Japan contracted\nin the first quarter and decelerated sharply further in Asian\ncountries that had experienced financial turmoil.\n\nConsumer prices were unchanged in March and rose moderately\nin April. Energy prices were down slightly further in April after\ndeclining markedly in previous months, and food prices increased a\nlittle; excluding food and energy, consumer price inflation picked up\nin April as prices of services accelerated and prices of tobacco\nsurged higher. Over the course of recent months, core consumer\ninflation had accelerated to rates that were somewhat above those\nregistered earlier. Even so, on a year-over-year basis, the increases\nin total and core consumer prices were substantially smaller over the\ntwelve months ended in April than they were in the year-earlier\nperiod; falling import prices apparently helped damp the goods\ncomponent of the index. At the producer level, price inflation of\nfinished goods other than food and energy picked up a bit in April,\nbut it was considerably lower over the twelve months ended in April\nthan over the year-earlier interval. Inflation at earlier stages of\nproduction also remained subdued. The rate of increase in hourly\ncompensation of private industry workers slowed in the first quarter,\nreflecting smaller advances in both the wage and benefit components of\nthe index; however, compensation costs accelerated appreciably on a\nyear-over-year basis, primarily as a result of faster growth in wages\nand salaries.\n\nAt its meeting on March 31, 1998, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\nthat were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging\naround 5-1/2 percent. However, in light of increased concerns that\ngrowth in aggregate demand might outpace the expansion of the\neconomy's potential for some time, possibly generating inflationary\nimbalances in labor markets, the Committee decided that the directive\nshould include a bias toward the possible firming of reserve\nconditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\nconsiderable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over the months\nahead.\n\nOpen market operations throughout the intermeeting period\nwere directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with\nthe intended average of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds\nrate. Though tax flows were heavy at times and reserves were drained\nfrom depository institutions as tax payments spilled into Treasury\ndeposits at the Federal Reserve Banks, the federal funds rate averaged\na little below its intended level over the period. Most other market\ninterest rates declined slightly on balance over the intermeeting\nperiod; incoming data suggested that labor markets remained tight and\nthat the economy retained considerable upward momentum, but market\nparticipants evidently gave greater weight to information indicating\nthat wage and price inflation was well contained in the first quarter.\nShare prices in U.S. equity markets rose further despite some reports\nof soft corporate earnings, and equity prices in most other industrial\ncountries also reached new highs.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of major currencies changed little on balance over the\nperiod. The dollar declined considerably against the German mark and\nother continental European countries amid signs of strong growth in\nthe German economy and further progress in resolving the outstanding\nissues associated with next year's launch of the euro; French and\nGerman interest rates also rose slightly over the period. The dollar\nappreciated somewhat against the yen; the announcement of a large\nfiscal stimulus package and Japan's intervention in support of the yen\ndid not offset indications of further weakening in the Japanese\neconomy and related declines in Japanese interest rates. Other Asian\nfinancial markets came under renewed pressure after a brief period of\nrelative calm. The currencies of several key Asian emerging market\neconomies depreciated considerably against the dollar; and in sharp\ncontrast to the performance of equity markets in most industrial\ncountries, prices in Asian equity markets declined substantially on\nbalance over the period to near their lows of late 1997 or early 1998.\n\nM2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but data for\nlate April and early May showed M2 declining and M3 leveling out; much\nof the fluctuation in M2 during the April-May period appeared to be\nrelated to movements of funds associated with unusually heavy nonwithheld tax payments and a surge in mortgage refinancings to take\nadvantage of lower long-term rates. On balance, the underlying growth\nof these aggregates seemed to be slowing from the pace of the first\nquarter. The moderation in M3 partly reflected a reduced need for\nnon-M2 sources of funds at a time when bank credit expansion seemed to\nbe slowing. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently had\nslipped somewhat after picking up earlier in the year.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that\nthe expansion of economic activity would slow considerably during the\nnext few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. Reduced growth of\nforeign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable rise\nthat had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were\nexpected to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports\nand to add to the pressures on domestic producers to hold down prices\nto meet import competition. An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace\nof inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the\ngrowth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more\nmoderate trajectory of final sales. The staff analysis suggested that\nfurther strong gains in income, along with the surge in household net\nworth over the past several years, would support brisk, though\ngradually diminishing, gains in consumer spending. Housing demand,\nfostered by the favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership,\nwas expected to remain at a generally high level, though the\nanticipated slowing in income growth over the projection period would\ndamp residential construction activity somewhat. Substantial\nincreases in capital spending would continue, but slower growth in\nbusiness sales and profits would produce a gradual deceleration.\nWhile pressures on production resources were likely to abate to a\ndegree as output growth slowed, inflation was expected to increase\nsomewhat from its recent pace in response to rising compensation costs\nassociated with persisting tightness in labor markets, a limited\nrebound in energy prices, and a diminishing drag on non-oil import\nprices.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members noted the exceptional strength in\ndomestic final demand and viewed robust further expansion in such\ndemand as highly likely. Final purchases were being supported by\naccommodative financial conditions, especially a rising equity market,\nby ebullient consumer sentiment, and by business spending on\nproductivity-enhancing equipment. While there were limited indications of weakness in some sectors of the economy--such as\nmanufacturing, energy, and agriculture in some areas--the members did\nnot see conclusive evidence of appreciable moderation in the pace of\nthe overall economic expansion. Nonetheless, they generally believed\nthat substantial moderation in the expansion was a likely prospect in\ncoming quarters, largely as a consequence of a marked slowing in\ninventory investment from the clearly unsustainable pace of the first\nquarter and, to a lesser extent, from some further weakness in net\nexports. The outlook for the latter was especially uncertain, and the\nweakness could be greater than previously anticipated owing to renewed\nturmoil in emerging Asian economies and pronounced weakness in Japan.\nWhether the moderation in U.S. economic growth would be sufficient to\nforestall cost increases arising from tight labor markets that in turn\nwould add to pressures on prices was open to question. To date,\ndevelopments in business costs had been relatively benign, owing to an\nimportant extent to somewhat faster productivity growth. This\ncircumstance and a number of one-time influences holding down costs\nand prices had contained inflation at rates that were lower than those\nseen in several decades, and probably would continue to do so for a\nwhile. But the members generally were concerned that inflation might\nbegin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets\ntightened further.\n\nIn their assessment of the factors underlying the persisting\nstrength of aggregate final demand, members took particular note of\nthe effect of accommodative financial conditions. The rapid growth in\nconsumer spending was being bolstered by large gains in stock market\nwealth; and the strength in housing and other interest-sensitive\nconsumer expenditures also reflected declines in nominal, and perhaps\nin real, intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the ample\navailability of loans. Likewise, the ready availability of equity and\ndebt financing on favorable terms was a key factor in the continuing\nrobust growth of business investment. Indeed, some members expressed\nconcern that the widespread perceptions of reduced risk or complacency\nthat had bolstered equity prices beyond levels that seemed justified\nby fundamentals were beginning to be felt in a variety of other\nmarkets as well, including commercial and residential properties,\nbusiness ventures, and land. In the view of a number of members,\nrapid growth of the monetary aggregates, though it had slowed very\nrecently, was a further indication that financial conditions were not\nrestraining economic activity.\n\nDespite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line\nwith their earlier expectations, the members were persuaded that\nappreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely\nprospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact\ntiming and extent were unknown. Key elements in this assessment were\nthe outlook for inventories and net exports. The surge in inventory\naccumulation in the first quarter did not appear to have resulted in\noverall stock imbalances as evidenced by stock-sales ratios or anecdotal reports. Even so, growth in inventory investment at a pace\nsharply exceeding the sustainable growth of final sales was unlikely\nto continue for an extended period. Given the ample availability of\nindustrial capacity and the related absence of pressures on lead or\ndelivery times, business firms did not need to build precautionary\nstocks. Thus, inventory investment was likely to respond to the\nexpected deceleration in final sales over coming quarters. Some\nmembers expressed reservations about the probable extent of the\ndeceleration in the period ahead, especially in the context of their\nexpectations of a still relatively robust uptrend in final sales.\n\nDevelopments in Asia clearly were having adverse effects on a\nnumber of U.S. industries, but the overall effects on the U.S. economy\nappeared to have been limited thus far. Indeed, the direct effects of\nthe Asian financial and economic problems on U.S. trade over time\nneeded to be weighed against their indirect but positive effects in\nthe near term in helping to hold down U.S. interest rates and in\nreducing the prices of oil and other imported commodities. However,\nmembers were concerned that, as evidenced by the most recent\ndevelopments, conditions in Asian financial markets and economies were\ndeteriorating further, with potentially adverse consequences for net\nU.S. exports. Of particular concern in this regard was the\npossibility of worsening economic conditions in Japan and the negative\nimplications not only for U.S. trade with Japan but for worldwide\ntrade and financial markets. Some members also commented that\nunsettled financial and economic conditions in East Asia could tend to\nexacerbate the economic problems of several important emerging\neconomies in other parts of the world, including major Latin American\ntrading partners of the United States. On balance, forecasts of a\nlimited further drag on U.S. net exports from developments in Asia\nwere subject to substantial uncertainty, with the risks tilted toward\na greater effect on the U.S. economy than had been anticipated\nearlier. Moreover, the lingering effects of the dollar's appreciation\nlast year against a broad array of currencies would continue to\ndepress the nation's foreign trade position for some time.\n\nThe decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in\nnearly three decades underscored anecdotal reports of further\ntightening in labor markets in recent months and added to concerns\nabout the outlook for inflation. Though the first-quarter data had\nnot suggested as steep an increase as a number of observers had\nanticipated, labor compensation clearly was trending higher. But as\nsuggested by the rise until recently in profit margins, businesses had\nbeen able to realize productivity gains that tended to offset the\nfaster increases in compensation costs. Indeed, while the most recent\ndata were difficult to read, once likely revisions were taken into\naccount productivity improvements could well be on a steeper uptrend\nthan had been estimated earlier. Even so, the members remained\nconcerned that if pressures on labor resources continued to intensify,\nthe associated increases in labor compensation would at some point\nsignificantly exceed the gains in productivity. The resulting\npressures on prices might be muted, but probably only for a time, by\nthe inability of many business firms in highly competitive markets to\nraise their prices or to raise them sufficiently to offset rising\ncosts. Some members emphasized that a number of developments that had\nheld down prices, including the dollar's sizable appreciation last\nyear, the drop in world oil prices, and the downtrend in employee\nbenefit cost increases were unlikely to be repeated over the coming\nyear and could even be reversed to a degree. Members acknowledged,\nhowever, that the nexus between labor market tightness, accelerating\nlabor costs, and the effects on price inflation was very difficult to\nascertain and analyses based on earlier patterns that pointed to\nrising inflation had proved consistently wrong in recent years.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the\nintermeeting period ahead, a majority of the members indicated that\nthey preferred or could accept an unchanged policy. These members\nalso expressed a preference for retaining the asymmetric instruction\nin the directive that the Committee had adopted at the previous\nmeeting. In this view, the uncertainties in the outlook for economic\nexpansion and inflation remained sufficiently great to warrant a\ncontinued wait-and-see policy stance. Considerations underlying this\nview included the possibility that financial and economic conditions\nin Asia might worsen further and exert a stronger retarding effect on\nthe performance of the U.S. economy than presently seemed to be in\ntrain. A good deal of uncertainty also surrounded the potential\nextent to which developments in the domestic economy, notably the pace\nof inventory accumulation over coming months, might foster slower\neconomic expansion and the related degree to which pressures in labor\nmarkets would be affected. Moreover, considerable questions remained\nabout the relationship of labor market pressures to inflation. In\nthese circumstances, it was possible that inflation would continue to\nbe contained, though the risks clearly seemed to be tilted in the\ndirection that action would become necessary at some point to keep\ninflation low.\n\nWhile a delay in implementing a tighter policy that\nultimately proved to be needed to curb rising inflation involved some\nrisks, many of the members concurred in the view that the potential\ncosts of postponing action for a limited time were small. By some\nmeasures, inflation had continued to drop in the first quarter, and\nthe appreciation of the dollar, reduced commodity prices, and low--if\nnot declining--inflation expectations would help to hold down nominal\nwage increases and price pressures for some time, even if, as a number\nof members suspected, the economy was now producing beyond its long-\nrun potential. Forecasts of rising inflation had proved unreliable\nand needed to be viewed in light of the considerable uncertainties\nsurrounding them. The members recognized, however, that the longer\nany needed action was delayed, the more important it would be to take\nprompt and perhaps vigorous action once the danger of rising inflation\nbecame clearer.\n\nAnother reason for not taking action at this meeting was the\npossibility that even a modest tightening action could have outsized\neffects on the already very sensitive financial markets in Asia. The\nresulting unsettlement could have substantial adverse repercussions on\nU.S. financial markets and, over time, on the U.S. economy. Many of\nthe members emphasized, however, that market considerations could not\nbe allowed to jeopardize the effective conduct of a U.S. monetary\npolicy aimed at an optimal performance of the U.S. economy. Indeed,\nsuch a performance would best serve the interests of troubled\nfinancial markets and economies abroad.\n\nA number of members indicated that the decision was a close\ncall for them. In this regard, some emphasized that financial\nconditions were very accommodative in terms of the ample availability\nof financing to most borrowers on very attractive terms and increases\nin equity prices. Several expressed concern that the persistence of\nquite rapid monetary growth this year was symptomatic of a monetary\npolicy that was not positioned to restrain ebullient domestic demand\nsufficiently, even if short-term real interest rates were quite high.\nAlthough some of these members could accept postponing action for the\npresent to await further information on the balance of risks, two\nmembers, while acknowledging the uncertainties that surrounded the\neconomic outlook, indicated a strong preference for tightening the\nstance of policy at this meeting. They believed that current policy\nwas accommodating excessive strength in aggregate demand that very\nlikely would be felt in higher inflation before long. Prompt\ntightening was needed to avert the necessity of stronger and\npotentially disruptive policy actions later to contain inflation.\n\nAll the members who intended to vote for an unchanged policy\nat this meeting supported the retention of a directive that was biased\ntoward restraint. In their view, current developments did not call\nfor any policy action, at least at this meeting, but because they felt\nthe risks were tilted in the direction of rising inflation, a policy\ntightening move, possibly in the near future, was a likely though not\nan inevitable prospect.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two\nof the members supported a directive that called for maintaining\nconditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged\nfederal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that contained a bias\ntoward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal\nfunds rate. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run\nobjectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary\ndevelopments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal\nfunds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate\nmight be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve\nconditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent\nwith considerable moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the\nmonths ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nMr. Poole dissented because he believed that the sustained\nincrease in money growth in recent quarters and associated\naccommodative conditions in the credit markets pointed to rising\ninflation. Although faster productivity growth suggested that trend\noutput growth might be modestly higher than previously thought, the\ngrowth rate of aggregate demand over the past two years clearly had\nexceeded the economy's long-run growth potential. Without a reduction\nof aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise. In his view, the\nFederal Reserve should therefore take prompt action to reduce money\ngrowth to limit the rise in inflation and to avoid an increase in\nlonger-term inflation expectations, which would tend to destabilize\naggregate employment and financial markets.\n\nMost market interest rates have declined slightly on\nbalance over the intermeeting period. Share prices in\nU.S. equity markets have moved up a little further. In\nforeign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of major currencies has changed little on\nnet over the period. However, the dollar has risen on\nbalance against the currencies of key emerging market\neconomies, particularly those in Asia. Equity markets in\nAsia have fallen substantially over the period to near\ntheir lows of late 1997, while those in Europe have risen\nto new highs.\n\nM2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but\ndata for late April and early May show M2 declining and\nM3 leveling out. The swing in these measures seemed to\nbe related largely to movements of funds associated with\ntax payments. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial\ndebt appears to have moderated somewhat after a pickup\nearlier in the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in\nFebruary established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of\n1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured\nfrom the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of\n1998. The range for growth of total domestic non-\nfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\nto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly\nlower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the\nintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions\nare expected to be consistent with considerable\nmoderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kelley,\nMeyer, Mses. Minehan, Phillips, and Rivlin.\n\nMessrs. Jordan\nand Poole.\n\nMr. Jordan also noted that the monetary and credit aggregates\nhad accelerated further from already rapid growth rates in 1997. In\nhis view, these high growth rates were fueling unsustainably rapid\nincreases of real estate and other asset prices, and reports of \"too\nmuch cash chasing too few deals\" were becoming more frequent.\nAnticipated gains on both real and financial investments had risen\nrelative to the cost of borrowed funds. In these circumstances, it\nwas increasingly likely that the Committee would face a choice between\nsmaller increases in interest rates sooner versus larger increases\nlater. He added that maximum sustainable economic growth occurs when\nbusinesses and households act on the assumption that the dollar will\nmaintain its value over time, and nothing he had heard from consumer\ngroups, bankers, or other business people in his District led him to\nbelieve that decisions were being made in the expectation that the\npurchasing power of the dollar would be stable. Furthermore,\nexpectations that market values of income-producing investments would\ncontinuously rise relative to underlying earning streams were not\nconsistent with a stable purchasing power of money. He also believed\nthat the view that real interest rates currently were high was not\nconfirmed by observed behavior. Bankers told him that both consumers\nand businesses believed that credit was cheap and plentiful. These\npotentially inflationary conditions and imbalances in the economy were\nnot conducive to sustained maximum growth.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday-Wednesday, June 30-July 1, 1998.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 1:35 p.m."
