Bryan and Evans, Assistant Vice Presidents,\nFederal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Chicago\nrespectively\n\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\ndevelopments in foreign exchange and international financial markets\nin the period since the previous meeting on November 12, 1997. There\nwere no open market transactions in foreign currencies for System\nAccount during this period, and thus no vote was required of the\nCommittee.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial\nmarkets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period November\n12, 1997, through December 15, 1997. By unanimous vote, the Committee\nratified these transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic\noutlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity had continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent\nmonths. The further advance reflected moderating but still sizable\nincreases in business fixed investment and consumer spending and an\nupturn in business inventory accumulation. Housing demand remained at\na high level, and deepening trade deficits provided only a partial\noffset to the strength in domestic spending. Against this background,\nemployment and production posted further large gains. Price inflation\nremained subdued despite tight labor markets and some pickup in the\nrate of wage increases.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in October and\nNovember. The increases in payrolls were widespread across sectors,\nand in November they included notably large gains in the service-\nproducing industries. Manufacturing employment also rose considerably\nfurther in November, and aggregate weekly hours of production or\nnonsupervisory workers registered a particularly large advance in that\nmonth. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in\nNovember, its low for the current expansion.\n\nIndustrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in\nOctober and November. The November increase was widespread across\nmarket groups. It featured particularly strong growth in the\nproduction of durable goods, including a surge in the output of motor\nvehicles and parts. Partly offsetting the strength in the manufacturing\nsector in November was a decline in mining activity and in\nutilities output after two months of robust expansion. The large rise\nin production boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing\ncapacity to its highest level in more than two years.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending had moderated in recent months\nfrom a very brisk pace during the summer. Retail sales were unchanged\non balance over October and November after having increased rapidly in\nthe third quarter. The flat sales for the two months reflected some\nsoftening in the durable goods category, notably at automotive\ndealers, and relatively slow growth in the nondurable goods sector.\nConsumer spending on services appeared to have remained relatively\nrobust in October. According to recent surveys, consumer sentiment\nremained at an extraordinarily ebullient level in the context of\ncontinuing strong gains in jobs and incomes, the cumulative effect of\nlarge increases in household net worth, and the ready availability of\nfinancing for most consumers.\n\nAvailable information suggested that business capital\nexpenditures had moderated in recent months from the exceptionally\nstrong increases of the second and third quarters. Shipments of\noffice and computing equipment fell in nominal terms in October,\nwhile shipments of communications equipment were about unchanged after\nhaving posted strong gains earlier in the year. Shipments of\nnondefense capital goods other than aircraft and high-tech equipment\nalso declined in October. Spending on nonresidential structures had\nsoftened a bit in recent months.\n\nIn the housing sector, demand had continued to display\nappreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively\nmoderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of\nhomebuying conditions. In October, the latest month for which data\nwere available, sales of new homes were well maintained, and sales of\nexisting homes rose. Housing starts increased somewhat in October and\nNovember from the already high level reached earlier in the year.\n\nAfter picking up considerably in September, the pace of\nbusiness inventory investment in October remained above that recorded\nearlier in the summer. The rise in stocks at the manufacturing level\nwas at a somewhat faster pace in October than in September, but the\nbuildup in inventories at the wholesale level, and especially at the\nretail level, moderated in October. On balance, inventories remained\nat quite low levels in relation to shipments and sales.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was\nsignificantly larger in the third quarter than in the second. Exports\nof goods and services rose only marginally in the third quarter, as\nincreases in machinery, industrial supplies, and service receipts were\nnearly offset by sharp declines in exports of aircraft and gold.\nImports of goods and services rose appreciably in the third quarter;\nthe increases were in most major trade categories and included strong\nfurther advances in the quantity of oil imports. Economic growth in\nmost major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the\nthird quarter, and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter\nsuggested continued above-trend expansion. However, growth since\nmidyear appeared to have recovered only modestly in Japan from a sharp\nsecond-quarter decline. The ongoing financial turmoil affecting a\nnumber of Asian economies had led to a significant slowdown in\neconomic activity in the region. Available data also suggested a\nfavorable economic performance in major Latin American countries in\nthe third quarter.\n\nConsumer price inflation had remained at a low level in recent\nmonths, reflecting a variety of influences including a favorable labor\ncost environment, falling import prices, small increases in energy\nprices, and declining inflation expectations. For the twelve months\nended in November, overall consumer prices and consumer prices\nexcluding food and energy items increased appreciably less than in the\nyear-earlier period. At the producer level, prices for finished goods\nedged lower in November and the index was down somewhat on balance\nover the past year, reflecting declines in the food and energy\ncomponents. The rate of increase in average hourly earnings had\npicked up in recent months, apparently reflecting the effects of an\nincrease in the federal minimum wage and some bidding up of wages in a\ntight labor market.\n\nAt its meeting on November 12, 1997, the Committee had\nadopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve\nmarkets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate\naveraging around 5-1/2 percent. In the directive the Committee had\nretained a tilt toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during\nthe intermeeting period. Such a bias had been seen as consistent with\nthe members' views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising\ninflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the\ndirection of some firming than toward easing. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming\nmonths.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar rose\nover the intermeeting period in terms of both the trade-weighted index\nof the other G-10 currencies and the currencies of a number of Asian\ncountries. The dollar's appreciation against the German mark and\nother Western European currencies appeared to reflect market\nperceptions that the prospects for monetary tightening had ebbed in\nthose countries in light of the persistence of subdued inflation and\nindications that the continuing financial turmoil in Asian and other\nemerging economies was likely to have a retarding effect on the\neconomies of the industrial countries. The dollar's appreciation\nrelative to the yen appeared to reflect rising concerns about the\nJapanese economy in the wake of continuing financial difficulties in\nJapan and spillover effects from events elsewhere in Asia. The dollar\nstrengthened further in this period against most of the other East\nAsian currencies, notably against the Korean won.\n\nGrowth in the broad monetary aggregates picked up to\nrelatively rapid rates in November. Strength in currency and a surge\nin liquid deposits boosted the expansion of M2, while that of M3 was\namplified by a step-up in RP borrowing to help finance more rapid\ngrowth in bank credit. For the year through November, M2 expanded at\na rate that was slightly above the upper bound of the Committee's\nannual range, and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of\nits range. The increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt for the\nyear to date was at a pace somewhat below the middle of the\nCommittee's range.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested somewhat\ngreater moderation in economic expansion than had been projected\nearlier and slightly less pressure on wages and prices. A number of\nfactors were expected to contribute to the slowing of aggregate demand\nand reduced pressure on resources. These included: a slackening in\nworld economic expansion that, in conjunction with the appreciation of\nthe dollar, would substantially restrain U.S. exports; some moderation\nof the growth in household and business investment; and a diminution\nin the desired rate of inventory accumulation.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented on indications that growth in\neconomic activity had remained solid and that inflation had continued\nto be surprisingly low. While wages appeared to be increasingly subject\nto upward pressure, productivity had picked up in recent\nquarters, and the persisting strength in profits suggested that unit\nlabor costs were not accelerating noticeably. The evidently higher\npace of productivity growth was very encouraging, though it was still\ndifficult to assess how long this favorable performance might last and\nthe extent to which it might ease the price pressures that could\nemerge if the economic expansion did not moderate as members anticipated.\nDomestic demand for goods and services had been quite strong\nand was likely to remain reasonably robust. However, the effects of\nthe persisting turmoil in Asian financial markets were likely to\nmoderate the pace of expansion, though the extent of this effect was\ndifficult to judge. The ongoing turbulence since the last Committee\nmeeting, which included further noticeable increases in the dollar\nagainst the currencies of affected countries, likely would have a\nsomewhat greater damping effect on output and prices in the United\nStates than previously had been anticipated. Exports to many Asian\ncountries, and possibly to other U.S. trading partners whose economies\nmight be adversely affected by the spillover effects of developments\nin Asia, would be reduced, and declines in import prices would ease\ninflation pressures. However, the ultimate extent of the adjustment\nin Asian economies remained unknown, and more substantial downward\npressure on the economies of the United States and its trading\npartners could not be ruled out.\n\nWith regard to the prospects for final demand in key\nsectors, the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against\na wide range of currencies, along with the prospective slackening in\nworld economic expansion associated with the Asian turmoil, could be\nexpected to exert a considerable damping effect on U.S. exports over\nthe next several quarters. In addition, increased uncertainty about\nfinancial asset values, possibly related in part to further difficulties\nin Asia, could lead to greater caution in spending, while a\nsubstantial decline in equity values, should it occur, would have a\nmore pronounced effect by reducing household wealth and raising the\ncost of equity capital. However, a number of members suggested that\nconsumer spending might hold up relatively well if the effects of the\nAsian crisis on the U.S. economy were not markedly deeper or more\nprolonged than currently expected. To date, anecdotal reports\nindicated only scattered signs of weaker export demand, primarily some\nslackening in orders for and shipments of selected commodities such as\nagricultural goods and lumber and wood products, and there were few\nindications of reduced demand for manufactured goods. At the same\ntime, business contacts were optimistic about holiday sales, tourism\nwas booming in some parts of the country, and spending for services\nhad been brisk. In the circumstances, continuing gains in wages and\nemployment, the prevailing high levels of confidence, the cumulative\neffects of very large increases in household wealth in recent years,\nand the intense competition among retailers for the consumer's\nattention could promote substantial further growth in consumer\nexpenditures. The same factors, along with the favorable cash-flow\naffordability of home ownership, were maintaining housing demand at a\nrelatively high level.\n\nThe outlook for business fixed investment remained favorable.\nIn the near term, the low cost of capital, the ready availability of\nfinance on attractive terms, and the potential for reducing production\ncosts in highly competitive markets were providing strong support for\ncapital spending. Moreover, shrinking vacancy rates and rising lease\nrates were fostering a rapid increase in the number of large\ncommercial building projects, notably office buildings, that were\nplanned or under way in many areas of the country. Even so, the\ngrowth of business capital spending was expected to slow from the\nunusually rapid pace of recent quarters in response to the projected\nsmaller increases in sales and profits arising from moderating\neconomic growth. In addition, business firms were expected to trim\nthe pace of their inventory accumulation to keep stocks at desired\nlevels relative to sales.\n\nIn their comments on recent developments in labor markets,\nthe members emphasized the very limited supply of new workers and the\nextraordinary tightness prevailing in markets throughout the nation.\nSeveral reported that the scarcity of available workers was limiting\nthe growth of economic activity in some parts of the country and that\nsome employers were trying out novel approaches aimed at enticing\npeople not currently seeking a job to enter the work force. While\nwage increases remained moderate on balance, larger increases were\ngradually becoming more pervasive as labor markets tightened. Moreover,\nemployers were continuing their efforts to attract or retain\nworkers that were in particularly scarce supply by means of a variety\nof bonus payments and other incentives that were not included in\nstandard measures of labor compensation. There also were reports of\noffers of expanded benefits and, in some instances, the granting of\nvery large wage increases to highly skilled technical personnel.\n\nIn the course of their discussion, many members remarked on\nthe absence of inflationary price pressures during a period when\neconomic activity had risen briskly and labor markets had grown\nsteadily tighter. The muted effect of higher labor compensation on\nunit labor costs and prices reflected sharp advances in productivity\npartly associated with the rapid expansion of the stock of capital;\nthe latter had been stimulated, most probably, by the desire to\nenhance efficiency and thus hold down costs. In addition, the earlier\nappreciation of the dollar and the unusually damped increases in the\ncost of health benefits in recent years had helped to limit the rise\nin compensation.\n\nAs members had noted at previous meetings, these favorable\ninfluences were likely to erode over time. Anecdotal reports\nindicated that health insurance premiums were beginning to trend\nhigher, and the dollar would not rise indefinitely. More\nfundamentally, persistent tightness in labor markets risked a continuing\nuptrend in labor compensation increases that, at some point, could\nnot be fully offset by productivity gains. Under those circumstances,\ncompetitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to\ncompensate for increases in their costs. However, for some period\nahead, developments associated with the turmoil in Asia along with the\npartly related appreciation of the dollar would tend to intensify\nimport competition and damp the prices of goods.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, nearly all the members favored a proposal to maintain an\nunchanged policy stance. In their discussion, members emphasized that\nprice inflation had remained subdued, indeed with some key price\nmeasures indicating declining inflation, despite the persistence of\nrobust economic growth and high levels of resource use, notably in\nlabor markets. They expressed concern, however, that multiplying\nindications of faster wage increases might presage rising price inflation at some point. Weighing against the risks of higher inflation\nwas the financial turmoil that had intensified in Southeast Asia\nduring October and more recently in Korea. The effects of those\ndevelopments on the U.S. economy were quite limited thus far, but the\nmembers expected some damping of economic expansion and price\nincreases in the quarters ahead and they did not rule out a potentially strong impact in the event of an even deeper crisis in Asia, or\none that spread to other countries. Nonetheless, many members\ncommented that, with domestic demand still quite strong and the\neconomy possibly producing beyond its potential, they viewed the risks\non balance as pointing to rising price inflation and the next policy\nmove as likely to be in the direction of some tightening. However,\nmost members agreed that the need for such a policy adjustment did not\nappear to be imminent, and that prevailing near-term uncertainties\nwarranted a cautious wait-and-see policy posture. One member, while\nacknowledging the downside risks to the expansion associated with\npotential developments in Asia, still was persuaded that the economy\nprobably would continue to expand at an unsustainable pace and that\nmonetary policy should be tightened promptly to avert a further\nbuildup of pressures in already strained labor markets, associated\nincreases in labor costs, and at some point an inevitable rise in\nprice inflation.\n\nOther considerations cited by some members in favor of an\nunchanged policy included the possibility that, because a policy\ntightening move was not expected at this juncture, even a modest\nfirming action might well have outsized effects in financial markets,\nespecially the foreign exchange markets. Current conditions in\ndomestic financial markets clearly remained supportive of spending,\nbut it also was noted that the real federal funds rate was relatively\nhigh and that growth in the broad measures of money was expected to\nmoderate over coming months after a period of robust expansion. The\nmembers agreed that the crosscurrents that were generating the present\nuncertainties in the outlook for economic activity and inflation made\na flexible approach to monetary policy particularly desirable at this\njuncture.\n\nViews were somewhat more divided with regard to the instruction in the directive relating to the possible adjustment of policy\nduring the intermeeting period. A majority of the members indicated a\npreference for a shift to a symmetrical directive even though many\ncontinued to anticipate that the next policy move was likely to be in\na tightening direction. They noted that while the probability of any\npolicy change in the near term was very low, uncertainties in the\noutlook had increased, and they could not rule out the possibility\nthat the next change might be in the direction of some easing if,\ncontrary to current expectations, the turmoil in Asia were to\nintensify to the extent that it seemed likely to exert very\nsubstantial effects on the U.S. economy. A symmetric directive would\nposition the Committee to respond flexibly in either direction to\nunanticipated developments in the period ahead. Other members\nexpressed a slight preference for retaining a directive that was\ntilted toward tightening. In their view, such a directive would\ncontinue to underscore their concern that at current and prospective\nlevels of resource utilization, rising inflation was the most serious\nrisk to the economy and the Committee remained committed to fostering\nprogress toward a stable price environment that in turn would heighten\nthe prospects for sustained economic expansion and full employment.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nmember endorsed a directive that called for maintaining conditions in\nreserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds\nrate of about 5-1/2 percent and that did not include a presumption\nabout the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the\nintermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\nmonetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher or\na slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the\nintermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\ndomestic policy directive:\n\nShort-term interest rates have registered small\nmixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting\non November 12, 1997, while bond yields have fallen\nsomewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets recorded\nmixed changes over the period; equity markets in other\ncountries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile. In\nforeign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has\nrisen over the intermeeting period in terms of both the\ntrade-weighted index of the other G-10 countries and the\ncurrencies of a number of Asian countries.\n\nM2 and M3 grew rapidly in November. For the year\nthrough November, M2 expanded at a rate slightly above\nthe upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a\nrate substantially above the upper bound of its range.\nTotal domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent\nmonths at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\nfinancial conditions that will foster price stability and\npromote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of\nthese objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July\nreaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for\ngrowth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent\nrespectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1997. The range for growth of\ntotal domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7\npercent for the year. For 1998, the Committee agreed on\na tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for\ngrowth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from\nthe fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.\nThe behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to\nbe evaluated in the light of progress toward price level\nstability, movements in their velocities, and developments\nin the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\nconsistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\naverage of around 5-1/2 percent. In the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and\nsustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\nto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\na slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower\nfederal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting\nperiod. The contemplated reserve conditions are\nexpected to be consistent with some moderation in the\ngrowth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nMessrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kelley,\nMeyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.\n\nMr. Broaddus.\n\nMr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a\nmodest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent\npersisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services. He\nrecognized the case for holding policy steady given recent\ndevelopments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he\nbelieved, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide\nvaluable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain\nabove a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later.\nHe thought further that the potential benefits of this insurance\noutweighed the risk that such an action would have a significant\nnegative impact on U.S. economic activity. He also believed that\nsignaling a greater willingness to tolerate modest policy adjustments\nin response to emerging developments would foster more flexible\nmovements in longer-term financial markets, and specifically enable\nlonger-term interest rates to play their traditional role as automatic\nstabilizers for the economy more effectively.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday-Wednesday, February 3-4, 1998.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m."
