By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic\nfinancial markets and on System open market transactions in government\nsecurities and federal agency obligations during the period May 23,\n1995, through July 5, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified\nthese transactions.\n\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for growth of money and debt in 1995 and\n1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\nperiod ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York.\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\nlevel of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter.\nConsumer spending apparently remained sluggish, and business spending\non plant and equipment rose less rapidly than in other recent\nquarters. With final sales flagging, firms sought to hold down\nproduction and employment in order to keep inventories under control.\nBroad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased faster on\nbalance thus far this year, but signs of some moderation in inflation\nwere evident in recent price data. Growth of labor compensation costs\nremained subdued.\n\nNonfarm payroll employment fell substantially in May after a\nsmall decline in April and reduced gains in the first quarter.\nPayrolls in the services industry continued to rise in May, but the\npace of hiring was well below the average rate of increase over other\nrecent months. In manufacturing and construction, employment\ncontracted further in May, although part of the job decline in\nconstruction might have been temporary, reflecting heavy rains and\nfloods in the South. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower in\nMay, to 5.7 percent, but was somewhat above its average for the first\nquarter.\n\nIndustrial production continued to weaken in May, and\nincoming data suggested a further decline in June. Manufacturing\noutput fell in May for a fourth consecutive month, reflecting another\ncutback in the production of motor vehicles. Output of non-auto\nmanufactured goods was unchanged, with increases in the production of\nnondurable consumer goods and non-auto business equipment offsetting\ndeclines in output elsewhere. Utilization of manufacturing capacity\ndropped again in May but was still at a relatively high level.\n\nNominal retail sales were about unchanged over April and May.\nPurchases at furniture and appliance stores were up slightly on\nbalance over the two months. Sales at automotive dealerships and\napparel outlets fell in April but revived somewhat in May. Spending\nat building materials stores fell in both months. The retail sales\nreports, in combination with data on consumer prices and unit motor-vehicle sales, suggested that inflation-adjusted spending for consumer\ngoods had changed little since the fourth quarter of last year.\nHousing starts were unchanged on balance over April and May; a\nreduction in starts of single-family homes was offset by a rise in\nstarts of multifamily units. Adverse weather in some parts of the\ncountry might have contributed to the sluggishness in starts. Home\nsales were higher in May: Sales of new homes turned up sharply, and\nsales of existing homes also advanced somewhat.\n\nShipments of nondefense capital goods increased considerably\nin May after being unchanged in April. Shipments of computing\nequipment remained robust on balance over April and May, but growth of\nshipments of other business equipment slowed significantly. Sales of\nheavy trucks rebounded strongly in May from an April decline. Recent\ndata on new orders for nondefense capital goods suggested that\nspending on business equipment might moderate somewhat in the months\nahead after an extended period of rapid expansion. Nonresidential\nconstruction continued to trend appreciably higher in April;\nparticularly large gains were recorded in the public utility,\nindustrial, and institutional categories.\n\nBusiness inventories grew at a little slower rate in April\nthan in the first quarter. In manufacturing, inventory investment\nremained brisk in April but slowed somewhat in May; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the two months was at the high end of the range for\nthe past year. At the wholesale level, the rate of increase in stocks\nin April equaled the first-quarter pace and the ratio of stocks to\nsales reached its highest level in several years. Inventory\naccumulation in the retail sector was more moderate in April. More\nthan half the rise occurred at automotive establishments. The\ninventory-to-sales ratio for retailers other than auto dealers had\nremained stable for a number of months and was near the middle of its\nrange for recent years.\n\nThe nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\nwidened substantially in April from its average rate for the first\nquarter. The value of imports was up sharply, with increases posted\nin nearly all major import categories. The value of exports rose\nmodestly from the first-quarter level; increases in exports of\naircraft and industrial supplies were partially offset by declines in\nexports of automotive products to Canada and Mexico. Available data\nindicated that, on average, economic growth in the major foreign\nindustrial countries had been sluggish in the first quarter and\napparently had remained so in the second quarter; growth had been\nparticularly weak in Canada and Japan.\n\nIncoming data suggested that price inflation might be slowing\na little after having picked up early in the year. Consumer prices\nrose a bit less in May; energy prices recorded another sizable\nincrease, but food prices changed little and prices of other items\nadvanced more slowly. However, for the twelve months ended in May,\nprices of nonfood, non-energy consumer items increased slightly more\nthan in the preceding twelve months. At the producer level, prices of\nfinished goods were unchanged in May, reflecting declines in the\nprices of finished foods and finished energy goods; excluding food and\nenergy, prices of finished goods rose in May at the same rate as in\nApril. For the year ending in May, producer prices rose moderately\nafter being essentially unchanged in the previous year. At earlier\nstages of production, producer prices grew at a considerably slower\nrate or declined in May, suggesting some easing of cost pressures over\nthe next few months. Average hourly compensation in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector accelerated in the first quarter of the year, owing in\nlarge part to temporary developments. Over the year ended in March,\nthis compensation measure increased somewhat more than it had over the\nprevious year. Average hourly earnings declined in May, but the\nchange in hourly earnings over the past twelve months was slightly\nlarger than the advance over the preceding twelve-month period.\n\nAt its meeting on May 23, 1995, the Committee adopted a\ndirective that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the\nlikely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting\nperiod. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the\nCommittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,\nfinancial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable\nduring the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated\nwith this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate\ngrowth in the broader monetary aggregates over the months ahead.\n\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were\ndirected toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve\npositions. The federal funds rate generally remained near 6 percent,\nbut most short-term interest rates were down on balance in response to\nincoming economic data, particularly the employment report for May,\nthat were seen by market participants as increasing the likelihood\nthat monetary policy would be eased in the near future. Longer-term\ninterest rates also declined in reaction to growing indications that\nefforts to narrow substantially the U.S. budget deficit might be\nsuccessful. Yields on corporate and municipal obligations fell less\nthan Treasury rates and risk spreads widened a little, particularly\nfor junk bonds. Major indexes of equity prices rose over the\nintermeeting period, partly in response to lower interest rates.\n\nIn foreign exchange markets over the intermeeting period, the\ntrade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10\ncurrencies declined considerably on balance. The dollar fell sharply\nin the week after the May meeting on further news of weakening in the\nU.S. economy but rebounded somewhat at the end of the month when\nconcerted central-bank intervention was carried out. The dollar\nremained relatively stable over the balance of the period.\n\nGrowth of M2 strengthened substantially in May and June.\nDownward adjustments in returns on deposits and retail money fund\nshares had lagged declines in market interest rates in recent months,\nand investors evidently responded by shifting funds from market\ninstruments into these M2 assets. For the year through June, M2\nexpanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995. M3 also\naccelerated in May and June; and for the year through June, this\naggregate grew at a rate well above the annual range set in February.\nThe pickup in M3 growth importantly reflected more rapid inflows to\ninstitution-only money funds, whose yields also adjusted sluggishly to\nfalling money market rates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had\ngrown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent\nmonths.\n\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that\neconomic activity would expand sluggishly over the next few months as\nbusiness firms adjusted production schedules to bring inventories into\nbetter alignment with sales. Subsequently, as inventory positions\nwere corrected, and with underlying support for final sales from the\nfavorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in\nthe equity and debt markets, the economy would begin to expand at a\nmoderate pace. The forecast assumed a modest step-up in the pace of\nconsumer spending in response to some diminution of concerns about job\nprospects and incomes as well as improved financial conditions and\nhousehold balance sheets. Homebuilding was projected to pick up\nsomewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates\nand the related improvement in housing affordability. Business\noutlays for new equipment were expected to slow from the very rapid\npace of the past few years in response to the slower growth of sales\nand profits, but lower costs of capital and the ready availability of\nfinancing would help to sustain appreciable growth in such investment.\nExport expansion would pick up in response to some anticipated\nstrengthening in the economies of major U.S. trading partners.\nConsiderable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but\nin light of recent developments the forecast now reflected a greater\ndegree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, the prospects\nfor some easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested\nthat price inflation likely would moderate from its recently higher\nlevel.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective\neconomic developments, members commented that the apparent pause in\nthe expansion was likely to prove temporary, and their forecasts\ngenerally pointed to an upturn in overall economic activity to a pace\nin the neighborhood of the economy's potential by the latter part of\nthis year or early 1996. Many emphasized that the prospects for a\nstrengthening economy were enhanced by the drop in intermediate- and\nlong-term interest rates and the rise in equity prices. In the view\nof most members, however, the risks to the outlook were tilted to the\ndownside. Several stressed that the ongoing adjustments to business\ninventories could prove to be more pronounced and of longer duration\nthan they anticipated, with negative repercussions on production and\nincomes and in turn on consumer spending and business investment.\nOther downside risks included the adverse implications for exports of\npotentially less-than-projected expansion in a number of major foreign\neconomies. Nonetheless, recent developments suggested that the period\nof maximum risk to the domestic expansion might have passed. With\npressures on resources having diminished and likely to ease somewhat\nfurther and with labor costs remaining subdued, the risk of continuing\nincreases in inflation had fallen considerably; indeed, in the view of\nmany members inflation should moderate over the projection period.\n\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee\nsets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the\nmembers of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not\ncurrently serving as members provided their individual projections of\nthe growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the\nrate of inflation for the years 1995 and 1996. The forecasts of the\nrate of expansion in real GDP for 1995 as a whole had a central\ntendency of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, reflecting expectations of a pickup in\ngrowth to a moderate pace in the second half of the year; for 1996,\nprojections of growth in real GDP centered on a range of 2-1/4 to\n2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the\ngrowth forecasts were concentrated in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4\npercent for 1995 and 4-3/4 to 5-3/8 percent for 1996. The rate of\nunemployment associated with these forecasts was expected to edge\nhigher in the second half of this year to a consensus range of 5-3/4\nto 6-1/8 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1995 and 1996.\nProjections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer\nprice index, pointed to a small decline over the projection horizon;\nthe projections converged on rates of 3-1/8 to 3-3/8 percent for 1995\nand 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 percent for 1996.\n\nIn the course of the discussion, members indicated that much\nof the economic information that had become available since the May\nmeeting had suggested a greater softening in the economy than they had\nanticipated and had raised concerns about the timing and strength of\nthe upturn over coming quarters. However, the most recent data and\nsome of the anecdotal reports from around the country had a better\ntone. Among the positive factors in the economic outlook, members\ngave particular emphasis to the favorable financial climate, including\nthe stimulative effects of lower interest rates on interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy, the ready availability of financing from\nmarket sources and banking institutions, and the impact of rising\nequity and bond prices on balance sheets. Business and consumer\nsentiment also remained generally favorable, though anecdotal reports\nsuggested a heightened degree of caution among business contacts in\nmany parts of the nation. Members observed that the expansion did not\nappear to have produced overall imbalances in the economy aside from\nan apparent overhang of inventories in some industries. The ongoing\nadjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels\nwere seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. Some members\ncommented that the inventory correction in the second quarter appeared\non the basis of the available evidence to be less than was expected\nearlier and that the period of inventory adjustment might therefore be\nmore extended in time than they had anticipated. While such a\ndevelopment might not in itself be sufficient to tilt the economy into\nrecession, in the possible context of relatively sluggish growth in\nfinal demands, the economy would be vulnerable to adverse domestic or\nexternal shocks. On balance, while the timing remained uncertain, a\nresumption of growth at a moderate rate was viewed as a likely\nprospect, given the underlying strength of the economy.\n\nIn their review of prospective developments in key sectors of\nthe economy, members noted that consumer expenditures had fallen short\nof earlier expectations, but signs of some firming were visible,\nnotably the indications of an improvement in sales of motor vehicles\nsince early spring. While a continued sluggish performance of the\nconsumer sector could not be ruled out, the members generally expected\na resumption of moderate growth in consumer spending. The upturn\nundoubtedly would be limited to some extent by the apparent exhaustion\nof much of the earlier pent-up demands and perhaps by concerns about\njob prospects and incomes, but the effects of reduced interest rates\non borrowers and the wealth effects from gains in values of financial\nassets should help to sustain moderate growth. Moreover, if the\nstrengthening in housing activity materialized as projected, sales of\nconsumer durables would be favorably affected. While consumer\nconfidence had declined earlier, recent surveys indicated that\nconfidence had stabilized or even edged up more recently and was in\nany event at relatively high levels in most parts of the country.\n\nBusiness fixed investment appeared to have moderated since\nearlier in the year, though expenditures for both producer durable\nequipment and nonresidential structures were still registering strong\ngains. Further moderation was anticipated over the course of coming\nquarters in association with slower growth in business sales and\ndecreased pressures on producer resources. While some concern was\nexpressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in\nthe growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the\neconomy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. The ready\navailability of financing on favorable terms and the ongoing need to\nmodernize equipment and other producer resources for competitive\nreasons, notably to take advantage of continuing improvements in\ncomputer and other technologies, should foster continued overall\ngrowth in business investment. Members also noted that the strength\nin business profits, though likely to moderate cyclically at some\npoint, remained a favorable factor undergirding business capital\nspending.\n\nHousing activity had stagnated in recent months, but this\nsector of the economy also was expected to provide some stimulus to\nthe expansion as home buyers responded to reduced mortgage rates.\nAlthough the latest available data indicated that housing starts were\nstill relatively depressed, home sales and mortgage loan applications\nfor home purchases had strengthened recently. With some exceptions,\nbuilding industry contacts in local areas tended to confirm broader\nindications that improvement in housing activity was occurring.\nMembers also noted that rising occupancy levels and rents should\nsupport fairly robust construction of multifamily housing in many\nareas.\n\nWith regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, members gave\nconsiderable emphasis to recent developments in Congress which\nsuggested that there could be greater deficit reduction over the years\nahead than had been built into many forecasts. The direct effects of\ndeficit cutbacks would tend to hold down the growth in final demand\nand act as a restraining influence on overall economic activity over\nthe projection horizon. But those cutbacks also would have favorable\neffects on financial markets, thereby stimulating to an extent\noffsetting increases in spending. Over the longer run, deficit\nreduction should enhance the performance and growth of the economy,\nthough monetary policy makers would need to carefully monitor possible\ntransition effects.\n\nA considerable downside risk in the view of many members was\nthe outlook for exports. Economic activity in the major foreign\nindustrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the\nfirst half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength\nof the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the\nfaster growth in U.S. exports. Most of the major economies in Latin\nAmerica also were projected to strengthen, and indeed such\nexpectations were reflected in financial markets, but substantial\nproblems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook. On the\npositive side, members observed that U.S. exports were now quite\ncompetitive in world markets, as evidenced by continuing gains in\nexports to numerous countries, and such a perception was reinforced by\nanecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products\nby firms around the country. On balance, some growth in exports\nremained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current\nexpectations.\n\nThe members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the\neconomy had diminished, though some still saw the potential for\nlittle or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation.\nMany referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in\nrecent months, and they generally felt that such pressures would be\ncontained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to\nmaterialize in line with their forecasts. Developments seen as\nconsistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal\nreports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for\nbusiness firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins.\nMoreover, despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas\nand industries, increases in nominal labor costs generally had\nremained subdued across the nation. Prices of many raw materials and\nsemi-finished goods had increased sharply in earlier months and these\nincreases would continue to put upward pressure on the prices of\nfinished goods, but there recently had been signs of some abatement of\ninflation at the earlier stages of production. Similarly, earlier\ndeclines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were placing\nupward pressure on the prices of many imported products, but the\nrecent stability of the dollar promised a diminution of such pressure\nover time. On balance, most of the members believed that the\nunderlying trend of inflation was now tilted toward gradual\ndeceleration in the context of marginally higher rates of unemployed\nlabor and other resources, but they acknowledged that the risks to\nsuch an outcome remained substantial.\n\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\nat this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and\ndebt aggregates that it had established in February for 1995 and it\ndecided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1996.\nThe current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth\nquarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995 included expansion of 1\nto 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range for\ngrowth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 3 to 7\npercent for 1995.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion, the members took account of\nthe accelerated rates of M2 and M3 growth since early spring that, for\nthe year to date, had lifted the expansion of M2 to the upper half of\nthe Committee's range and the expansion of M3 further above its\nrange. According to a staff projection, the growth of both aggregates\nwas likely to moderate over the balance of the year, assuming an\nunchanged monetary policy, as rates paid on various components of the\naggregates were adjusted more fully to the reductions in market\ninterest rates that had occurred since early in the year. Even so,\nthe projected growth of the broad aggregates would remain well above\nthat experienced over the last several years. These developments\nimplied velocity behavior for these aggregates that was more in line\nwith historical patterns after several years of pronounced and\natypical velocity increases. The members noted that financial\ninnovations, technical changes, and deregulation had obscured\nhistorical distinctions among various financial instruments and had\naffected the extent to which holders might shift funds into or out of\ncomponents of the monetary aggregates in response to changing interest\nrate patterns. As a result, substantial uncertainty remained about\nprojections of money growth and the future relationships of money and\ndebt to the basic objectives of monetary policy. Against this\nbackground, members expressed somewhat differing views regarding\nappropriate ranges for the growth of M2 and M3 in 1995 and 1996.\n\nWith regard to M2, a majority of the members favored or could\naccept a proposal to maintain the existing 1 to 5 percent range for\nboth years. These members noted that M2 growth was projected to\nremain within the current range, though in the upper half in 1995 and\nat the top in 1996. While recognizing that expansion at a rate above\nthat range could not be ruled out, especially for 1996, they suggested\nthat an increase in the range, at a time when substantial\nuncertainties continued to surround the relationship of M2 to broad\nmeasures of economic performance, would imply a degree of confidence\nregarding the relationship that the Committee did not possess at this\npoint. Moreover, if the more normal behavior of velocity over the\npast several quarters were to continue, a 1 to 5 percent range for\ngrowth of M2 likely would prove consistent with the Committee's\nultimate objectives of sustained economic expansion and reasonable\nprice stability. There was concern that an increase in the M2 range\ncould foster a misreading of the Committee's intentions, especially if\nsome easing in policy were to be approved during this meeting,\nexplanations of the technical reasons notwithstanding.\n\nMembers preferring a somewhat higher M2 range emphasized\nthat expectations for growth of this aggregate in 1995 and 1996 were\naround the upper end of the current range. In their view, under the\nFederal Reserve Act, the Committee's target ranges--and normally their\nmidpoints--should be consistent with the Committee's expectations for\ngrowth in nominal GDP and money. From this perspective, a higher M2\nrange was clearly defensible and the reasons for it easily\ncommunicated. Indeed, a failure to adjust the range upward could be\ninterpreted by observers as indicating an intent to tighten policy\nshould M2 growth remain high in relation to its current range.\n\nWith regard to M3, all the members indicated that they\npreferred or could accept an increase in its range to 2 to 6 percent\nfor both years. The current 0 to 4 percent range was quite low in\nrelation to the range for M2, judging by the average historical growth\nof this aggregate relative to that of M2. The range had been adopted\nin the light of unusual developments that had depressed M3 growth over\nmuch of the 1990s. Those developments, which also had served to curb\nM2 growth though to a lesser extent, involved a reduced role of\nbanking institutions in the intermediation of flows of funds between\nsavers and borrowers. That reduced role had been induced to a large\ndegree by balance sheet adjustments undertaken in response to\nextraordinary strains experienced by banks and thrifts. Against the\nbackground of favorable economic developments, the financial health of\ndepository institutions had improved markedly over the last few years,\nand the increased ability and willingness of these institutions to\nserve as financial intermediaries appeared to be working toward\nstrengthening the growth of M3 and lowering its velocity. In the\ncircumstances, the members believed that the contemplated increase in\nthe M3 range was essentially a technical response to developments that\nwere tending to restore both traditional financing patterns and the\nhistorical pattern of somewhat faster growth in M3 than in M2. In\nthis respect, the increase in the M3 range did not have any\nimplications for the underlying thrust of monetary policy, though the\nhigher range could prove to be more consistent over time with\nsustainable and noninflationary economic growth. As in the case of\nthe current M2 range, that conclusion assumed the eventual restoration\nof historic relationships between M3 and measures of overall economic\nperformance.\n\nThe Committee was unanimous in its view that the current\nmonitoring range for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt\nshould be retained for 1995 and extended to 1996. This view took into\naccount staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was\nlikely to grow at rates well within its 3 to 7 percent range--indeed,\nnot far from the midpoint--in both years.\n\nAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to\nreaffirm the range of 1 to 5 percent for growth of M2 in 1995 and to\nset the same range on a tentative basis for 1996:\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer,\nMs. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Ms. Phillips.\n\nVotes against this action: Mr. Blinder\nand Ms. Yellen.\n\nMr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen dissented on a technical judgment,\nnot a policy difference. They noted that if growth in the demand for\nM2 were close to historic norms in 1995 or 1996, as indeed it had been\nfor some time, then the Committee members' projections for nominal GDP\nwould likely imply M2 growth near the top of, or even above, the\ncurrent range. While the relationship between the growth of M2 and\nthat of nominal GDP remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty,\nthey were persuaded that the range--in fact, the midpoint of the\nrange--should normally be consistent with members' forecasts of\nnominal GDP growth. This would be truer to the spirit of the\naggregates targeting provision in the Federal Reserve Act. From this\nperspective, they viewed a higher M2 range for 1995 and 1996 as\nclearly preferable in communicating the Committee's objectives for the\neconomy and its expectations for money growth.\n\nThe Committee then voted to raise the range for growth of M3\nto 2 to 6 percent for 1995 and to extend that higher range\nprovisionally to 1996:\n\nVotes for this action : Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nThe Committee voted to retain the 3 to 7 percent monitoring\nrange for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt for 1995 and to\nextend that range on a tentative basis to 1996:\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,\nMelzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Mses. Phillips\nand Yellen.\n\nVotes against this action: None.\n\nThese votes constituted approval of the following paragraph\nfor the directive that would be issued at the end of the meeting:\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary\nand financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In\nfurtherance of these objectives, the Committee\nreaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established\non January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5\npercent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to\nthe fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also\nretained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the\nyear that it had set for growth of total domestic\nnonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range\nfor M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to\ntake account of changing intermediation patterns. For\n1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis\nthe same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary\naggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter\nof 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of\nthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated\nin the light of progress toward price level stability,\nmovements in their velocities, and developments in the\neconomy and financial markets.\n\nIn the course of the Committee's discussion of its monetary\ngrowth ranges, members commented on the failure of the monetary\naggregates to provide a reliable nominal anchor for the conduct of\nmonetary policy in recent years. Moreover, the restoration of\nhistoric relationships, or the emergence of new but stable\nrelationships, between money growth and measures of progress toward\nbroad economic objectives could not be predicted with any degree of\nconfidence. Some members expressed the view that in these\ncircumstances the Committee needed to continue to look at potential\nalternative approaches to guide the formulation of policy and to\ncommunicate its intentions to the public, especially with respect to\nthe Committee's objective of promoting price stability over time.\n\nIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting\nperiod ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they favored or\ncould support a proposal to ease slightly the current degree of\npressure on reserve positions. Preferences for an unchanged policy\nstance and for somewhat greater easing also were expressed. In\nsupport of at least slight easing, members commented that they viewed\ncurrent monetary policy as somewhat restrictive, judged in part by the\nlevel of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate. This degree of\nmonetary restraint had been appropriate early in the year when the\neconomy was operating at or possibly beyond its long-run potential and\ninflation pressures appeared to be mounting. Some modest easing was\ndesirable now that the growth of the economy had slowed considerably\nmore than anticipated and potential inflationary pressures seemed to\nbe in the process of receding. Although inflation was higher than in\n1994 and the economy was still operating at an elevated level, looking\nforward many members saw prospects for declining inflation and the\npossibility of shortfalls in economic growth. The members agreed that\nunder present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of\npolicy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and\nwould be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued\nprogress toward price stability over time. Several members also\nobserved that any move toward less restraint should be cautious at\nthis point because easing would represent a change in the direction of\npolicy and its repercussions on financial markets, including the\nforeign exchange markets, could be relatively pronounced.\n\nA few members preferred somewhat greater easing. They\nstressed that such a move was warranted by the recent pause in the\nexpansion and the apparent vulnerability of the economy to a variety\nof downside risks. Indeed, a move from what they saw as a restrictive\nmonetary policy toward a more neutral policy stance was somewhat\noverdue in their view. While they could support a slight adjustment\nto policy at this point, these members were persuaded that the stance\nof monetary policy probably would need to be eased by more than a\nslight amount over time to accommodate the intermediate- and long-term\nneeds of an expanding economy. Moreover, the risks of increasing\ninflationary pressures appeared to be relatively remote in the context\nof the current and anticipated performance of the overall economy.\nThe declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were\nhelping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on\nmarket expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to\nratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial\nreversal of those desirably lower rates.\n\nMembers who leaned toward an unchanged policy remained\nconcerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and whether\na somewhat easier policy stance would be consistent with the objective\nof capping inflation and setting the stage for further progress toward\nprice stability. The available evidence on the economy's current\nperformance remained mixed and most forecasts pointed to moderate\nstrengthening ahead; in the circumstances an easing move did not\nappear to be needed at this time. One member emphasized that,\nwhile the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a\npolicy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in\nterms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next\nyear. Although their preference would be to wait for further evidence\non the performance of the economy, all but one of these members\nindicated that, given the current uncertainties surrounding the\neconomic outlook and the small amount of easing that was proposed,\nthey would not dissent from the majority position.\n\nWith regard to possible adjustments to policy during the\nintermeeting period, most of the members who favored some easing also\npreferred an asymmetric directive, including a marked preference on\nthe part of those who supported greater easing than the majority. An\nasymmetric directive was consistent with the view shared by most\nmembers that the risks to the expansion were biased to the downside,\nbut no member expressed a strong presumption about the likely need to\nease policy during the weeks ahead. The Committee would, of course,\nmonitor and respond as needed to the incoming economic information.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one\nof the members indicated that they favored or could support a\ndirective that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure\non reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible further\neasing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.\nAccordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful\nconsideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the\nCommittee decided that somewhat greater monetary restraint might be\nacceptable or somewhat lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable\nduring the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the\nreserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent\nwith moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by\nthe Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in\naccordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\nthat the level of economic activity was about unchanged\nin the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell\nin April and May after posting reduced gains in the\nfirst quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at\n5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to\ndecline in May, reflecting another cutback in the\nproduction of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization\nwas down somewhat further. Total retail sales have\nbeen sluggish on average in recent months. Housing\nstarts were about unchanged over April and May, but\nsales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders\nfor nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in\nrecent months but still point to considerable further\nexpansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend\nappreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade\nin goods and services widened in April from its average\nrate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer\nand producer prices have increased faster on average\nthus far this year, though there were signs of some\nmoderation in the most recent data; advances in labor\ncompensation costs have remained subdued.\n\nMost interest rates have declined somewhat further\nsince the Committee meeting on May 23. In foreign\nexchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the\ndollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined\nconsiderably over the intermeeting period.\n\nM2 and M3 strengthened substantially in May and\nJune. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate\nin the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at\na rate well above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of\nits monitoring range in recent months.\n\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\nfuture, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the\nexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions. In\nthe context of the Committee's long-run objectives for\nprice stability and sustainable economic growth, and\ngiving careful consideration to economic, financial,\nand monetary developments, slightly greater reserve\nrestraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint\nwould be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The\ncontemplated reserve conditions are expected to be\nconsistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over\ncoming months.\n\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,\nMcDonough, Blinder, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer,\nMs. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and\nYellen.\n\nVote against this action: Mr. Hoenig.\n\nMr. Hoenig dissented because he believed the stance of\nmonetary policy should remain unchanged at this time. With the pace\nof economic activity likely to return to trend growth later this year\nand inflation expected to be higher this year and next than in 1994,\nhe felt an unchanged policy in the near term would enhance the\nprospects of achieving the Committee's long-run objectives of\nsustainable economic growth and price stability.\n\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would\nbe held on Tuesday, August 22, 1995.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:20 p.m.\n\nDonald L. Kohn\n\nFOMC"
