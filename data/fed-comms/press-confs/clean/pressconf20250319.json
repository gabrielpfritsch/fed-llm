  "text": "March 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon . My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people . The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years . Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved\ncloser to our 2 percent longer -run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline\nin the size of our balance sheet . I’ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nEconomic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nwith GDP rising at 2.3 percent. Recent indications , however, point to a moderation in consumer\nspending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024. Surveys of households\nand businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be\nseen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant pr ojects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year,\nsomewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two years.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per\nmonth over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has held in a narrow range for the past year. The jobs -to-workers gap has held steady for several\nmonths. Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmarket are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary\npressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end\nof this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer -run goal. Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up. We see this in both\nmarket- and survey- based measures, and surve y respondents, both consumers and businesses, are\nmentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of\nlonger -term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median\nprojection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a\nlittle higher than projected in December. In 2027, the median projection is at our 2 percent\nobjective.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today ’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent. Looking\nahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these\npolicy changes that will matter for the economy and f or the path of monetary policy. While there\nhave been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high. As we parse the incoming information, we ’re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. As\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nwe say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward—an admittedly challenging exercise at this time in light of\nconsiderable uncertainty. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of next year, unchanged from December. While these individual fo recasts are always subject to\nuncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated. And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or a decision.\nPolicy is not on a preset course. As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy\nstance in a manner that best promotes our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. If\nthe economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken\nunexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties\nthat we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nAt today’ s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet.\nSince we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2 trillion. While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains\nabundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets. Beginning in\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nApril, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion.\nConsistent with the Committee ’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run,\nwe are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged. This action has no implications for our\nintended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the medium term.\nThe Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five -year review of our\nmonetary policy framework. At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our\nmaximum -employment goal. As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public\nevents involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical\nfeedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings .\nWe intend to wrap up the review by late summer.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy : maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well\nanchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand\nthat our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we\ndo is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do ev erything we can to achieve our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I will look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for your time. So\ntwo things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then —and then GDP. How much of the\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nhigher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs , and since the policy path remains the same,\nare you effectively reading this as a one -time price -level shock?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so how much of it is , is tariffs? So let me say that it is going to\nbe very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs\nand from , from other —and that ’s already the case. You may have seen that goods inflation\nmoved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year. Trying to track that back to actual tariff increases, given what was tariff ed and what was not —very, very challenging. So\nsome of it— the, the answer is clearly some of it —a good part of it is , is coming from tariffs. But\nwe’ll be—we ’ll be working, and so will other forecasters , to try to find the best possible way to\nseparate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation.\nIn terms of the, the —your , your sort of looking -through question, too soon to say about\nthat. As , as I’ve mentioned, it , it can be the case that it ’s appropriate sometimes to look through\ninflation if it ’s going to go away quickly without action by, by us, if it’s transitory. And that can\nbe the case in the case of , of tariff inflation. I think that would depend on the , the tariff inflation\nmoving through fairly quickly and would depend critically , as well , on inflation expectations\nbeing well anchored—l onger -term inflation expectations being well anchored.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, I , I guess I ’m looking at the obvious here —the fact that\nthe policy path doesn’ t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also. D oesn’t that\nimply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it ’s just going to—we ’re\nback to “ transitory ” again?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think— I think that’ s kind of the base case, but , as I said, it’s—\nwe really can ’t know that. We’ re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out.\nAnd the fact that there wasn ’t much change —I think that ’s, that ’s partly because, you know, you\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nsee—you see weaker growth but higher inflation . They kind of offset. And also, frankly, a little\nbit of inertia when it—when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain\nenvironment . You know, you’ re—you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you\njust say, “Maybe I ’ll stay where I am. ”\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. You just\ndescribed inflation expectations as well anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment\nchanged at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty expressed by businesses, households, and forecasters?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our inflation expectations —of course, we do monitor inflation\nexpectations very, very carefully—basically , every source we can find, and, you know —short -\nterm, long- term, households, businesses, forecasters, market -based. And I think the picture ,\nbroadly, is this : You do see increases widely in short -term inflation expectations . And people\nwho fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that. If you look—in the survey world, if you look a little f urther out, you, you really—you really don ’t\nsee much in the way of an increased longer -term inflation —inflation expectations are mostly\nwell anchored , if you look at the [series maintained by the for example . Then you have market based, and it ’s the same pattern . You know, people and\nmarkets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be related to tariffs. We know from the surveys. But if you look out five years or five -year, fiv e-\nyear forward, you’ ll see that breakevens have— are either flat or, actually , slightly down in the\ncase of a longer -term one.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nSo we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully. We do not take\nanything for granted. T hat’s at the very heart of our framework : anchored inflation\nexpectations . But what —that ’s what you see right now.\nCOLBY SMITH. And , and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in\nconsumer confidence surveys? You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of\nfuture spending. B ut I’m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and\nto what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data .\nCHAIR POWELL. So let ’s start with the hard data. You know, we , we do see pretty\nsolid hard data still. So growth looks like it ’s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending\nmoderating a bit, but still at a solid pace. Unemployment ’s 4.1 percent . Job creation, most\nrecently , has been at a healthy level. Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in\nresponse to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year. So\nthat’s the hard data. Overall, it ’s a solid pi cture. The, the survey data, [in the case of] both\nhousehold and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about\ndownside risks. So how do we think about that? And that ’s—that is the question .\nAs I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data\nand actual economic activity hasn ’t been very tight . There have been plenty of times where\npeople are saying very down —downbeat things about the economy and then going out and\nbuying a new car. But we don’ t know that that will be the case here. We will be watching very\ncarefully for signs of weakness in the real data. Of course we will. But I, I—you know, given\nwhere we are, we think our policy’ s in a good place to r eact to, to what comes . And we think\nthat the right thing to do is , is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about , about what,\nwhat the economy’ s doing.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, Chair\nGreenspan once defined price stability as, as an environment in which inflation is so low and\nstable over time that it doesn ’t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms. Can\nyou say that today we have that price stability—t hat households and businesses are igno ring\nprice growth , or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys\nthat show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I do like that definition a lot . In fact, I used it at the recent\nconference where I spoke. So I think a world where , where people can make their daily\neconomic decisions , and businesses , and they’ re not having to think about the possibility of\nsignificantly high inflation —we know inflation will bounce around. T hat’s, that is price\nstability. You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that. I wouldn’ t say we were at\nthat. Inflation was running around 2 ½ percent for som e time. I do think with the arrival of , of\nthe tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed , if the SEP doesn ’t really show further\ndownward progress on inflation this year. And that, that ’s really due to the tariffs coming in.\nSo, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in ’26 and then down to 2 [percent] by ’27—of course , highly uncertain. So I see progress having ,\nhaving been made toward that, and then progress in the future . I think that progress is probably\ndelayed for the time being.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If that’ s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look\nat—they look at the —you know, the —and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in\ngrowth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there , but\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ncore inflation up by three -tenths . And so those two kind of —those kind of balance each other\nout. So people —not everybody, but , on balance , people wrote down similar numbers. The\nchanges aren ’t that big.\nThe other —the other factor , though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty. What\nwould you write down? I mean, it ’s just —it’s really hard to know how this is going to work out .\nAnd, again, we think our policy ’s in a good place . We think it ’s a good place where we can\nmove in the direction that —where we need to. But in the meantime, we, we —it’s, it’s really\nappropriate to wait for further clarity , and, of course, you know, the cost s of doing that, given\nthat the economy is still solid, are very low.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with F ox\nBusiness. So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people\nin from the sidelines in terms of hiring. But we ’re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at\n2023, 2024 levels. So, what ’s going on there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so that ’s a feature of the—has been for some time, a feature of\nthis labor market. You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging. Y ou’ve got wages\nthat are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we ’re going to keep getting, you know,\nrelatively high productivity. We ’ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural\nlevel . But job—the hiring rate is quite low , but so is the layoff rate. So the, the —you look at\ninitial claims or layoffs . So you’ re not seeing people losing their jobs, but you’ re seeing that\npeople who don’ t have a job having to wait longer and longer. And , you know, the question is ,\nwhich way does that break? If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would probably translate fairly quickly into unemployment , because people are —you know, it’s, it’s\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nnot a —it’s not a big hiring market. We’ve been watching that, and it ’s just not in the data . It\nhasn’t happened. What we’ ve had is , is a low -firing, low -hiring situation, and it seems to be in\nbalance now for , you know, for the last six, seven, eight months. That ’s where we are. T here’s\nhealthy levels of job creation , too. So , overall , it’s a labor market that ’s in balance, and, you\nknow, we , we watch it very carefully.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So then, have we seen the A dministration —the new\nAdministration ’s policies in the economic numbers yet? And when do you anticipate that\nhappening?\nCHAIR POWELL. In labor? Or in , in other —?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. In labor and inflation, just across the economy. Have we\nstarted to see the new policies take effect in the numbers?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know, only in a —kind of an early way. I mean , it’s only been\na few months, right? You know, for example, the , the layoffs that are happening here are, you\nknow, they’ re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may be meaningful to a\nparticular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they’ re not —they’re not\nsignificant yet . But we don’ t know . We don’ t know what —where that —how far that will go.\nWe’ll, we’ll find out much more.\nI mentioned that—you, you saw it —we’ve had two, two very strong goods inflation\nreadings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, a nd, I think , hard to trace it to specific\ntariffs . But it must have —it must have something to do with —it’ s either noise and it ’ll come\nback, and that —that ’s very possible, too. B ut if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you\nknow, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that.\nThat—those kinds of things happen, and they’ re very, very hard to capture because so much of it\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nis indirect. A great example is there —washing machines were tariffed in the last , last round of\ntariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed. So the\nmanufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it. So things happen very indirectly, and so there ’ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to try to\ntrace all that through. But , ultimately , though, it ’s too soon to be seeing significant effects in\neconomic data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Thanks , Chair Powell. You\nsaid transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case— transitory is the base case. Wasn ’t\nit the base case last time? And didn’ t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time? And\nwasn ’t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else? And so I ’m\njust wondering why the nine aren’ t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year.\nCHAIR POWELL. When you say “ last time, ” are you talking about the last —\nCRAIG TORRES. Pandemic, yes —during the pandemic.\nCHAIR POWELL. You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs.\nCRAIG TORRES. Okay.\nCHAIR POWELL. In which case, the inflation was , was transitory.\nCRAIG TORRES. Yeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . No—of course , we’re well aware of that . And, you know,\nit’s, it’s still the truth, if, if there ’s an inflationary impulse that ’s going to go away on its own, it ’s\nnot the right policy to, to tighten policy, because by the time you have your e ffect, you’ re—you\nknow, you’re —an effect that by—by design, you are lowering economic activity and\nemployment . And if that ’s not necessary, you don ’t want to do it. In real time, as we know, it ’s\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nhard to make that judgment. So—and, and we ’re well aware, you know, of what happened,\nobviously, with, with the pandemic inflation. But , I mean, we have to look at this as a—as a\ndifferent situation . There’s, there are differences and similarities. I mean , it’s a different time .\nYou know, we haven’ t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in\nmind. And , you know, we also have —we hear that people are very reluctant to take on —to, you\nknow, to, to allow prices to go up. A t the same time , we hear that businesses are intending to\npass many of these prices through. So it ’s hard to say how this is going to work out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman. The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, “Monetary policy cannot\noffset the impacts of a trade war. What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not\nlead to ongoing inflation.” I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization ,\nfaced with higher prices and weaker growth—th at the idea is, you have to take care of inflation.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know —so we , we have two goals , right ? We have maximum\nemployment and price stability , and we have to balance those. And , you know, there can be\nsituations in which they are in tension, right? And we have, actually have a provision in our —in\nour consensus statement that says what we should do in that case. That ’s a very challenging, you\nknow, situation for , for any central bank, and certainly for us. And so, what we say that we’ ll do\nis, we’ll, we’ll look how far each of those two goals is —each of those two measures is from its\ngoal, and then we ’ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them,\nand we ’ll make a judgment , because our, you know, our tools work in one direction. We’re\neither tightening or loosening. So it ’s a very challenging situation. Let me say, we don’ t have\nthat situation right now. That ’s not what the —that ’s not where the economy is at all. It’ s also\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nnot where the forecast is. I don’ t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant\nproblems like that, s o—\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Well, just to follow up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said\nthere ’s—a high probability of a recession. Where , where do you stand on whether or not t he\nslowdown you’ re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, there ’s always an unconditional probability—possibility\nof, of a recession. It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time , if you look back\nthrough, through the years . It—there could be , within 12 months , a one in four chance of a\nrecession. So the question is, is whether that —whether this current situation, those possibilities\nare elevated. I will say this : We don ’t—we don’t make such a forecast. If you look at outside\nforecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised —a number of them have raised their possibility\nof a—of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels —you know, still in the\nregion of , of the traditional, because they were extremely low . If you go back two months,\npeople were saying that the , the likelihood of a recession was extremely lo w. So, has moved up,\nbut it ’s not high.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi . Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. As\nyou know, I guess , last night the —President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade\nCommission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the\nAdministration ’s power to fire independent people. If those firings stand, is that a threat to the\nFed’s independence? Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think I , I did answer that question in this very room some time\nago, and I , I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Well , I just—okay, well , maybe I ’ll have another\nmulligan. [Laughter] As you know, I , I want ed to go back to the consumer sentiment ,\nparticularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan s urvey. In the summer of\n2022, you cited the rise in the long -term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that\nyou went big with a three -quarter -point hike. So I know you’ve —I mean , you’ ve talked about\nall the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that . And so\nI’m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we s aw last week from the University of\nMichigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge\nweight on it. I think it, it —that was an ex post story, but it wasn ’t the case. That was a\npreliminary reading , and so is this. And it ’s also —this is —that , that Michigan, the one you’ re\nreferring to, the longer -term thing —you know, we look at it , and we don’ t dismiss data that we\ndon’t like . We, we force ourselves to look at it. But it is an outlier compared to market- based\nand compared to other survey- based assessments of longer -run inflation expectations , so we ’ve\ngot to keep that in mind. And I, I —again, I , I would just say, we look at —we look at all of them.\nAnd that one —that one ’s kind of an outlier, but , you know, nonetheless , we, we take notice of it.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. There is a\nworry on Wall Street that when you say you want to study the net effect of the fiscal policies , we\nmay see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be “ behind the curve ” in\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nresponding to any downturn. How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early\nenough, unless you decide to be preemptive?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, look, we’re, we ’re aware of the —we’ re well aware of how\nthings are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and , you know, we will —we will use\nour tools to foster achievement of our goals to the —to the best we can. And, of course , we’re\ngoing to try to be timely with that. For right now, the hard data are pretty solid . We, we are\nobviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we ’re watching that\ncarefully. And we think it ’s a, a good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider\nadjusting our , our policy stance.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Do you think it ’s going to be hard to get clarity in a “ government\nby twe et”? I mean , do you have a , a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast\nyou can trust?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, I think we will. I just —it’ s hard to say when that will be. You\nknow, we ’re—these decisions are going to be made, and they ’re going to be implemented , and\nthen we ’ll know. At that point , we’ll know what the decisions are , and we ’ll have to make\nassessments then about their, their implications for the economy. Those things will happen. A\nlot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the course of this year, and we ’ll be adapting as we go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank\nyou for taking our questions. At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal\nfrom the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation . Can you “ walk us through” what that\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nlooked like over the last couple of months —if there were specifics, from the January meeting to\nnow, that helped you make those distinctions ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we say “ separating the signal from the noise, ” that’s just a\nway of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you’ re reading about\ndevelopments —the news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off and things\nlike that. That ’s—some of that is noise in the sense that it ’s, it’s not really telling you anything.\nYou’re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what’ s going to be the effect on\neconomic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things. So, so that ’s really when\nwe say “ signal and noise. ”\nSorry, the second thing was —?\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Or , similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you ’re\nmaking the distinction .\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s, that’s sort of a , a special case of that —of, you know, with the\nidea being —and I think —do think that the first two months of this year are a great example.\nYou’ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that average d close to\nzero, and you have to ask—it’ s coming during tariffs, but , you know, you—it’ s very hard to ,\nactually , scientifically go back and match up those increases and say , “Yes, I can prove that\nthat’s from tariffs. ” But it kind of has to be , to some extent. Plus, noise . There can be\nidiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that , that happens ,\ntoo, a nd that could be a big piece of it. You know, I think we ’ll know . In a couple of months ,\nwe’ll know whether those were —you know, where that really was from. But it’ s a— that’s\nanother case where I think it ’s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we\nsee over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ninflation and how much of it —sorry, from tariffs —and how much of it didn’ t. But that’ s what\nwe’ll be doing. W e’ll be doing that , and so will everybody else , and we ’ll all be trying very hard\nto, to make that assessment . And, you know, I, I ’m sure we will make a lot of progress on that.\nAnd we already have. But it, it’s going to be a challenge.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes\nsomething cross from noise to a signal —what that threshold would look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it would depend on what we ’re talking about. I mean ,\nobviously, you ’re looking for direct evidence that , that particular pieces of , of inflation are, are—\nor are clearly not —caused by tariffs. For example, something that was, you know, in the service\nsector that was far away from anything that ’s tariffed. You , you might think, okay, well that is —\nlike, frankly , housing services inflation—which , which, by the way, has been behaving well.\nYou know —which , for, for some time , was kind of our problem . Now it ’s been —it’ s slow, but\nit’s definitely, you know, moving down in a —in a very good way. It’s more now with goods\nand, to some extent , with , with nonhousing services inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Kelly O ’Grady,\nCBS News. So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically , but you say the economy and the\nhard data is still solid. What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don ’t feel\nthat strength? Because the hard data they ’re looking at is their grocery bill.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so a couple things . The grocery bill is about , about past\ninflation, really. There was inflation in ’ 21, ’22, and ’ 23, and prices went up. The current\nlevel —it’s not the change in prices. It’s, they’ re unhappy—and, and they ’re not wrong to be\nunhappy—that prices went up quite a bit , and they’ re paying a lot for those things. So that ’s—I\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthink that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time —a couple years—why people are\nunhappy with the —with the economy. It’ s not that the economy’ s not growing. I t’s not that\ninflation ’s really high . It’s not that unemployment is high. It ’s none of those things. We have,\nyou know, 4.1 percent unemployment . We’ve got 2 percent growth, and, you know, it ’s, it’s a\npretty good economy. But people are unhappy because of the price level. And , and I do—we\ncompletely understand and accept that.\nKELLY O’GRADY. And just to follow up: W hy are you still projecting two rate cuts\nthis year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer? Does that mean you see a\nslowdown in economic growth as a real threat?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I think if you—yeah, I mean, remember , we came into this\nwith—at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was. And so you\ncome in , and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation. And they kind of\nbalance each other out, so you think —and, and unemployment is really, really only , only a one -\ntenth change. So it ’s—there ’s just not a big change in the forecast. There really isn ’t. Modest,\nyou know, meaningfully higher growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for\ndifferent responses , right? So they cancel each other out , and people just said, “O kay, I ’m going\nto stay here. ”\nBut the second factor is, it ’s so highly uncertain. Is just —you know, we ’re sitting here\nthinking— and we , we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the\ncountry. We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the R eserve B anks\nand put it in the Beige Book—and also through contacts at the Board. And we get all that, and we, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not\nyet. And so we ’re watching carefully . So I would tell people that the economy seems to be —\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nseems to be healthy. We understand that , that sentiment is , is quite negative at this time, and that\nprobably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an A dministration. It’s making,\nyou know, big changes in, in areas of policy , and that ’s probably part of it. I do think the\nunderlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more —is more about the\nprice level.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask , first of all, if\nyou could clarify. You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the\ninflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to . Is that the tariffs\nthat have already been put in place? Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming\non April 2? And then also, if you wouldn’ t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet\ndecision and what drove that. Did t hat have anything to do with expectations of how the debt\nceiling —raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so, in the SEP , you’ ll see that there ’s not further progress on\ncore inflation this year. We’re kind of side flatlining, going sideways. We don’ t ask people to\nsay—to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not. But some of it is\nfrom tariffs. We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they’ re probably already—all ,\nall forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation [and] core CPI inflation this year,\nwithout exception. I’m not aware of an exception. So it ’s in there . I can ’t tell you how much of\nthat it is.\nIn terms of the balance sheet —so , yeah, we —I think —I guess the way I ’d say it is, you\nknow, it was the flows in and out of the , the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you\nknow, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nthe move that we made. And , broadly, Committee came around —came around to the view that\nwe, we would do the same thing we ’d already done, which is , once we —I guess in June, we —\nwas it June? Whenever it was, we, we lowered the pace of QT , and we ’re just going to do that\nagain. We ’re going to cut it roughly in half. And the sense of that is , if you’ re cutting the pa ce\nof QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay? So it ’s going—it ’s going to\nbe slower for longer. And people really like d that. People thought, “T hat’s, that’s a good idea.”\nYou know, it ’s like a plane. Y ou can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing. As we get\ncloser and we—by the way, we still think that reserves are abundant, although you begin to see\nsome of the —some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit , but we still think that\nthey’ re abundant. And , of course , now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are , are higher\nnow, so you can’ t really see the underlying signal. So we came around to the view , and , and it\nhad a lot of appeal, and so we did it. It really —it has no implications at all for monetary policy .\nIt has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet. I t isn’t sending a signal in\nany hidden way that you can try to tease out. It’s just not there. We ’re, we’re basically —it’s\nvery consistent with our plans and our practices that we ’ve published and that we ’ve followed\nsince we began this —what is a very successful, you know, rundown of the balance sheet. Again,\n[this is] the second time that we’ ve slowed the pace. A nd we ’ve said that we would stop when\nwe were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample. And , clearly , we’re not at\nthat level yet, but we ’re going to be approaching it more slowly. It’ s a commonsense kind of a —\nkind of a thing, and it had—it had pretty broad appeal, I will say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. You said in January, Chair Powell,\nthat inflation expectations remained well anchored. Would you still say they remain well\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nanchored today? And just to reiterate the question others have asked , if they’re not so well\nanchored, why hasn’ t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we —when we talk about inflation expectations being well\nanchored, we ’re talking about longer -run inflation expectations. And they really haven’ t moved\nmuch, I mean, if at all. There, t here’ s one reading that everyone ’s focusing on that ’s higher, but\nthe other survey readings and the market -based readings all show relatively, you know, well -\nanchored inflation expectations. You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course\nof a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case , we have tariffs\ncoming in. We don’ t know how bi g, what ’s—there ’s so many things we don’ t know, but we\nkind of know there are going to be tariffs , and they tend to bring growth down. T hey tend to\nbring inflation up at the —in the firs t instance. So, so I would say, you, you know, I ’m not\ndismissing what we ’re seeing in short -term inflation expectations. We, as I mentioned, follow\nthat very carefully. But when we say expectations are well anchored, we ’re really looking at,\nyou know, longer term, five year and out, and there ’s really no story to tell five years and out,\neither in market based or , or in surveys. But we keep —we ’ll watch it. I mean , we’re not, you\nknow, we’re, we ’re not going to miss any evidence that longer -term or med ium-term inflation\nexpectations are , are moving.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi , Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Treasury Secretary Bessent has\nobserved that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls\ngovernment or government -adjacent sectors—health care, education. Do you agree that there ’s\nsome weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth\nas something that has policy implications?\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So that, that has been the case. We talked about that over the course\nof the last year. There were—there were some good number of months and times when a lot of\nthe job creation was , was concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state\ngovernments, things like that. There were also times when private -sector job growth has been\nmoving, moving in a healthy frame —and they’ re all —they’re all jobs, but —and remember,\nwe’re, you know, we ’re at very low unemployment for, you know, for , for quite a time now. So\nI, I think it ’s a good labor market, but it ’s—look, it ’s something that we monitor carefully. From\nour standpoint, employment is employment. But I, you know —the , the elected government is\nentitled to have —you know, we , we don’ t have policies that address different kinds of\nemployment. But , but the elected government has a—has a different role , and they can—they,\nthey can have those.\nNEIL IRWIN. True. Quick QT question: Does the Committee envision at some point\ntapering the MBS runoff , runoff as well?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think tapering it—I , I don’ t know . There’s no plan to do that. You\nknow, at a certain point , we’ll stop runoff. A nd we may or may not stop MBS runoff , though,\nbecause, you know, we can—we can —we , we want to stop runoff in net at some point. We\nhaven’ t made any decisions about that, but , you know, we , we want the —we want the MBS to\nroll off our balance sheet. We really, strongly desire that , so—but we haven’ t made any\ndecisions about that , you know . We, we will—we —I think we ’d, we ’d look carefully at letting\nthat keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant , at some\npoint —a point that we ’re not at yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Thank you, Chair\nPowell. Several times today , you’ve said that you feel you ’re well positioned to wait for greater\nclarity. At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment. We’ ve\nseen a stock market that ’s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence\nsurveys. Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, see risks to the\ndownside. So my question is, how confident are you that you ’re well positioned? Or is that one\nmore thing that you’ re uncertain about?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m confident that we ’re well positioned in the sense that we ’re,\nwe’re well positioned to move in the direction we ’ll need to move. I , I mean , I, I don’ t know\nanyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast. I mean , the point is, we are —we are at, you\nknow, we ’re at a place where we can cut or we— or we can hold what is a clearly a restrictive\nstance of policy. And that ’s what I mean. I, I mean , I think we ’re—that ’s well positioned.\nForecasting right now, it ’s—you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current\nsituation, I just think it ’s—uncertainty is , you know, remarkably high.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. And , sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to\npivot back towards rate cuts in May?\nCHAIR POWELL. I , like, I, I think we ’re not going to be in any hurry to move . And, as\nI mentioned, I think we ’re, we’re well positioned to wait for further clarity , and not in any hurry.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nMATT EGAN. Matt Egan with CNN. Thank you, Chair Powell. The Fed ’s statement\nreleased today removed the line that previously said “ the Committee judges that the risk s to\nachieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.” Can you explain the\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ndecision to remove that line? Does it mean that you ’re now more concerned about inflation or\nabout employment?\nCHAIR POWELL. A ctually , it does not mean either of those things. You know,\nsometimes with language they—it , it lives its , its useful life , and then we take it off , and we —\nand, and that was the case there . There ’s really not meant to be any signal here. Over the past\nyear, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in\nbalance or close to being in balance. That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember .\nBut we ’re past that. Or, I’m sorry, no —beginning, beginning to cut. So we just —so we just\ntook it out. I, I actually would say that the more important thing now a bout risks —and this is in ,\nin pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP —if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of\nthe risks to our —of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation\nmandates. That’s, that’s a more salient point now than whether they ’re—whether they’ re in\nbalance.\nMATT EGAN. Just on the , the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined\nsignificantly since the Fed last met. Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility\nhaving a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending, especially among higher -income households?\nCHAIR POWELL. So financial conditions matter to us because , you know, financial\nconditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its e ffect. So ,\nso they’ re important. But what matters from, from a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is\nmaterial changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while —long\nenough to actually affect economic activity. So that ’s what we ’re looking for. I, I ’m not going\nto opine on the appropriate level of any market —equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nAnd I would just point you to the —to the bigger picture again. Y ou know, the , the real\neconomy, the , the hard data are still in , in reasonably good shape. It’ s the soft data —it’ s the\nsurveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of\nthings. We don’ t dismiss that. We’re watching it carefully, but , you know, we , we don’ t want to\nget ahead of that. You know, we , we want to focus on the hard data . This —if it’s—if that’ s\ngoing to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course , we’ll, we’ll\nunderstand that. But you don’ t see that yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. As you look to navigat e higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked\nabout heeding the lessons from the 1970s. Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means breaking the back of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, fortunately, we ’re in a situation where we have seen inflation\nmove down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment rate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent. So we now have inflation coming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you know, basically 2½ percent inflation , I would say , and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent\nunemployment. So , so that ’s what —that ’s what we did . That’s what, together, the economy\naccomplished. So I don’ t see any reason to think that we ’re looking at , at a replay of the ’ 70s or\nanything like that. You know, inflation—underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in\nthe 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs. So I, I don’ t think we ’re\nfacing —I, I wouldn’ t say we ’re in, in a situation that ’s remotely comparable to that.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And last month , the idea of a DOGE dividend was\nproposed, which would send $5,000 checks to every taxpayer from DOGE savings. President\nTrump and Elon Musk have supported this. There ’s reports there could be a bill introduced on\nCapitol Hill. What impact might that have on household savings and spending in terms of your\ngrowth and, and outlook for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I —it’ s not —it’s not appropriate for me to speculate on\npolitical ideas or, or fiscal policy , for that matter. So I ’m going to—I ’m going to pass on that\none. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Daniel.\nDANIEL AVIS. Hi, Chair Powell. Daniel Avis from Agence France -Presse. You\nmentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation. I ’m just wondering\nhow you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of\nretaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up. Was it something you\nconsidered during this meeting? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, since the very beginning, we ’ve had kind of a placeholder —the\nstaff has a placeholder of —range of —really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from\ntrade policy generally. And they generally assume full retaliation in those. And so that ’s, that’s\nkind of baked into the numbers. What happens —it will be complicated , and there will be some\nretaliation and some not and, and all that, but , ultimately , they’re trying to, with the placeholder,\ngive us a broad sense of what this might look like. This —when we know —when we actually\nknow the specifics, we ’ll be able to , to have still uncertain but , you know, better -informed\nforecasts. So , so, yes, that ’s in there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Last question goes to Jean.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nJEAN YUNG. Hi , Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Had a couple\nquestions on the balance sheet change that you made. So the minutes had initially described\nyour discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but it—from what\nyou said earlier, doesn ’t sound like there ’s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have\nat the moment after the , the debt ceiling is resolved. Is that the case?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so we , we looked at pausing, and we looked at , at slowing,\nand, really , people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of\nreasons. And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of , of this move. It\nslows down the path and probably lengthens it —you know, doubles it , effectively , by slowing it\nby half. That ’s, that’s —people thought that ’s, that’s a good place to be. It’ll, it’ll, you know,\nhelp us assure that this path is, is a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that. So that ’s how\nthat came about.\nJEAN YUNG. Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary\nmeasure during the debt ceiling episode, or —?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it was —it was actually —it was the, the TGA flows —\nTreasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this . But the more we thought about\nit, we came around to this. And , and, you know, it , it is—yes , it was provoked. T he original\ndiscussion was provoked by that. But I think what we came up with , though, was broader than\nthat and different than it. I t does address that issue, but it really is also —it fits in really nicely\nwith our principles and our plans, and the things w e’ve done before, and the things we ’ve said\nwe would do. So that ’s why I —you know, pretty , pretty strong support. I ’d just say it ’s, it’s\nnothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet . It’s just\nkind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer. Let ’s slow down a little bit\n\nMarch 19, 20 25 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nagain . And, that way , we’ll be more and more confident that we ’re getting where we need to get.\nYou can take your time getting there . You know, we ’re shrinking the balance sheet every\nmonth, and we think that ’s—we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well supported.\nThanks very much."
