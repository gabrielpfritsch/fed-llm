  "text": "June 16 , 2021\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the\neconomy until the recovery is complete.\nWidespread vaccinations, along wit h unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also\nproviding strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have\ncontinued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of\nincrease in de cades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity\nfrom depressed levels. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but\nhave shown improvement. Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by th e ongoing\nreopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions . The housing\nsector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. F orecasts from FOMC participants for economic\ngrowth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections. Even so, the recovery is incomplete , and risks to the economic outlook remain.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove, although the pace of improvement has been uneven. Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average , in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post\nnotable gains. Employment in th is sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre -\n\npandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this\nfigure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors\nrelated to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment\ninsurance payments , appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane\nin coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate st anding at 4.5 percent at the end\nof this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progres s, joblessness continues\nto fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation ha s increased notably in recent months . The 12 -month change in PCE prices\nwas 3.6 percent in April and will l ikely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.\nPart of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall ing out of the\ncalculation a s well as the pass -through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy\nprices. Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in\nspending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limit ed\nhow quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects\nhave been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for,\nfor inflation notably for this year. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected\n\nto drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from\n3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023.\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and\nbottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply\ncan adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent\nthan we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having\nwell-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to\npromote our broad-based and inclusive maximum -employme nt goal. Indicators of longer-term\ninflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have\nmoved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of\n2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation expectations were\nmoving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we ’d be prepared to\nadjust the stance of monetary policy.\nThe pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook. Progress on vaccinations\nhas limited the spread of COVID -19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public\nhealth crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk. Continue d progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal\neconomic conditions .\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promot e the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy\nstatement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation\n\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and\nlonger-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\nachieved. With regard to interest rates, we c ontinue to expect that it will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation ha s risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time.\nAs is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic\nconditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023. Of\ncourse, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with\nany certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now. More important than any\nforecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly a ccommodative .\nReaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer\nrequires holding rates near zero.\nIn addition, we are continuing to increase —continuing to increase our holdings of\nTreasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities\nby at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our\nmaximum-employment and price -stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March\n2020 has materia lly eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the\neconomy.\n\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the\nprogress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted it s asset purchase guidance la st\nDecember. While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off,\nparticipants expect that progress will continue. In coming meetings, the Committee will\ncontinue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals. As we hav e said, w e will provide\nadvance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.\nOn a note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s\nadministered rates. The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points\nin order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets. This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path\nfor the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy .\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel S iegel, the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have , specifically when it\ncomes to the labor market going into 2023. And I’m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare. Perhaps\nthey’ve retired ea rly. Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you\nconsider full employment going into 2023? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you\nlook at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it ’s clear ,\nand I am confident , that we are on a path to a very strong labor market —a labor market that , that\nshows low unemploym ent, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum. I\nmean, I think that ’s, that’s shown in our projections, it ’s shown in outside projections. And if\nyou look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we ’re going to be\nlooking at a very, very strong labor market.\nIn terms of exactly what that means, we ’ll, we’ll have to see how things evolve. I think\nwe learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor\nsupply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend.\nAnd, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again. At the same time, we have\nseen—in terms of participation, we ’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire. And so we ,\nwe don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I\nwould tend to, to look at it and think that it —that it can return to high levels, although it may\ntake some time to do that. But overall, this is —this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor\nmarket.\nIn terms of the near term, you ask as well —so we see a couple of things, a few things that\nseem likely to be holding back labor supply. There are very large amounts of job openings , and\nthere are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed. And the pace of, of filling\nthose jobs is —somehow feels slower than it might be. So I ’d point to a number of things , the\nfirst of which is just that most of the , the act of sort of goi ng back to one ’s old job—that ’s kind\nof already happened. So this is a question of people finding a new job. And that ’s just a process\nthat takes longer. There may be something of a speed limit on it. You ’ve got to find a job\n\nwhere , where your skills m atch what , you know, what , what the employer wants. It ’s got to be\nin the right area. There ’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job. So that ’s, that’s\nsort of a natural thing.\nIn addition, I would say that we , we look at, for example, a , a significant number of\npeople still say that they ’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there ’s a lot of\npublic facing because of—because of COVID. So that ’s clearly holding back some people, and\nthat should diminish as vaccinations move ahead.\nThere ’s also the question of childcare. Many are engaged in, in caretaking. And as\nschools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall —in the fall, then we\nshould see —we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers.\nFinally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or\nbe diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of\nSeptember , and I’d lik e some —that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs. So\nyou would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well. So you put all those\ntogether, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summe r and\ngoing into—going into the fall.\nI will also say , though, the last thing I’ ll say is , this is an extraordinarily unusual time.\nAnd we , we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like\nthis. And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data. It ’s not a\ntime to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of\npolicy. We need to see more data. We need to be a little bit patient. And I do think, though, that\nwe’ll, we’ll, we’ll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will —that will\ninform our, our thinking.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul Kiernan.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for the question. Your—the\nCommittee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the\nrest of the year. As you know, the three -month annualized rate for the past three months was , I\nthink, 8.4 percent in the CPI. And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain\nthose , those kinds of rates before you get nervous. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few\nmonths. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are , are\nconsistent with the view that prices —that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from\ncategories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening\nof the economy.\nSo, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is , is illustrative of this. The\nthought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and\nbottlenecks and the like, t hey should stop going up, and at some point , they, they, in some cases ,\nshould actually go down. And we did see that in the case of lumber.\nAnother example where we haven ’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted\nfor more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Used car prices are going up because\nof sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It ’s going up at just an\namazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time. So we think we ’ll be seeing some of that.\nWhen wi ll we be seeing it? We’re not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely\nto prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the , the timing\nof that is , is pretty uncertain, and so are the , the effects in the ne ar term. But over time, it seems\n\nlikely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be —will be temporary.\nAnd we ’ll be, you know, we’re going to be looking. We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing\ndata. I’ll , I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum -\nemployment goal, but also for inflation. And we ’ll be looking at that. And , and as I —as I\nmentioned, we expect and I expe ct that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the\nfactors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down. So I , I can ’t give\nyou an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.\nIf you look at the —if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my\ncolleagues on the , on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect\ninflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the fu ll range of, of, of\ninflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent , which is consistent with our—with\nour goals.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC.\nYLAN MUI. Hi. Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this. My que stion for you is that\nyou mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making\ntoward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases. In that discussion,\nyou said that you didn’t —haven ’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue\nto make progress. In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to\nsee that progress be made and when you migh t consider starting to reduce those purchases?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I , I expect that we ’ll be able to say more about timing as\nwe see more data. Basically, there ’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that. But you\ncan think of this meeting t hat we had as the “talking about talking about ” meeting, if you like.\nAnd I now suggest that we retire that term, which has —which has served its purpose well, I\n\nthink. So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in\nDece mber, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of\nsubstantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.\nAnd assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing\nour asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to\nassess the economy ’s progress toward our goals, and we ’ll give advance notice before\nannouncing any decision. The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress\nand not on any calendar.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Right. Thank you. Well, you mentioned—let me ask about\ninflation expectations. You said they we re—I think you mentioned in your opening statement\nthat you saw them as within target. Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures\nwe’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve ’s three -year outlook, which jumped\na bit—should those sort of be dismissed? And are we only looking at longer-term inflation\nexpectations? And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point? And on a\nrelated note, would the F ed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a\nmonthly basis? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations,\nbecause that ’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation. So and, and, you know, the\nshorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter -term inflation expectation measures,\nparticularly the surveys, move up. And , and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future\ninflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.\n\nSo we—ye s, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer- term inflation\nexpectations, they’ve moved up. They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you\nknow, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the\nECB and the Bank of Japan have been , where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding\ndown and you have a really hard tim e stopping that process once it begins. So that was a\nconcern. So it ’s, it’s good, actually , to see inflation —longer- term inflation expectations move\nback up to a range —it’s a range that ’s consistent with what our objectives are.\nThese are not precise me asures , and that’s —and they , they contain risk premiums of\nvarious kinds. And that ’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the\nmovement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of\neconomists, surveys of the public , and also market based. It ’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure\nyou know. We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were. And , by the\nway, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many\nyears ago, at a time when inflation was , was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe\neven a little bit below. So the answer is , yes, I think they are anchored and the y’re at a good\nplace right now. It ’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. And,\nyou know, as you know, it ’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to\nassure that inflation—longer- term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent\nwith our goal. We , we think that ’s an important reason. If, if inflation expectations are not\nanchored at a place that ’s consistent with your goal, it ’s not clear why you would expect to hit\nyour goal over the longer term. So it’s important.\nMICHELLE SMTH. Okay, now we ’ll go to James Politi with the FT.\n\nJAMES POLITI. Chair Powell —thanks, Chair Powell. Your economic projections\ntoday forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent , and core inflation of\n3 percent . If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute\nsubstantial further progress , in your mind? And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort\nof median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the\ntime, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the —of the discussion in the\nCommittee? And are we really moving towards sort of a post -pandemic stance? Is there greater\nconfidenc e that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than\nexpected?\nCHAIR POWELL. On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at\nsubstantial further progress is one that the Committee will make. And it would not be\nappropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not —that do or do not qualify.\nThat is —that is , you know, the process that we ’re beginning now at the next meeting. We will\nbegin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we —what we think\nwe’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around\nthe process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.\nIn terms of the , the, the two hikes —so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the\nfirst time, about the —about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They’re\nnot a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be —\nwould be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense. If you look at the transcripts from five\nyears ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions. Often\nthey don’t. And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate\n\nmoves. And that ’s not because —it’s just because it ’s so highly uncertain. There is no great\nforecaster of, of future dots. So , so dots to be taken with a —with a big , big grain of salt.\nHowever, so let me talk about this , this, this meeting. The Committee spelled out, as you\nknow, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the\ntarget range is made. And it ’s outcome based , it’s not time based. And , as I mentioned, it ’s\nlabor market conditions consistent wi th maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on\ntrack to exceed 2 percent . In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the\neconomy evolving in their most likely case. And , honestly, the main message I would take away\nfrom the SEP is that participants —many, many participants are more comfortable that the\neconomic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than\npreviously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes\nmaterialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.\nSo th e other thing I’ll say is , rate increases are really not at all the focus of the\nCommittee. The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy. But in terms of our\ntools, it ’s about asset purchases. That ’s what we ’re thinking about. Liftoff is, is well into the\nfuture. The conditions for liftoff—we ’re very far from maximum employment, for example.\nIt’s, it’s a consideration for the future. So the near-term thing is really —the real near -term\ndiscussion , discussion that will begin is really about the , the path of asset purchases. And , as I\nmentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings , continue to\nthink about our progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. W e’ll go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer from\nMarketplace.\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein,\nwhen you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to\ndo that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical,\nand transparent. And I can just tell you, we , we, we see real value in communicating well in\nadvance what our thinking is. And we ’ll try to be clear. And , as I mentioned, we ’ll, we’ll give\nadvance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so all I can say is that we , we think\nit’s important —we think where the balance sheet ’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much\ntransparency as we can give , and as far —as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to\nadjust their expectations. And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach\nsubstantial further progress and then have a —have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on\ntime. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say. We’re going to have to see more data. We’re a ways\naway from substantial further progress, we think. But we ’re making progress.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. So you can’t say generally how far in advance you\nwould signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, as we —as we approach that goal, we ’ll provide, you know, as\nmuch clarity as we can.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres at Bloomberg. If I were a businessman looking at the\nforecast today, I would ask how and when the F ed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent\ninflation. In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period? Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because , over the next three years , you’re going to be above inflation? So\nwhat is your look-back period? Does t he Committee have one? And if not, why not? And if\n\nthey don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to\n2¼ percent ? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so as part of our year-and-a -half-long process, the review\nthat we did and came out with at the end of that with the —with the new S tatement on L onger-\nRun G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we looked carefully at the idea. We ’ve all read all the\nliterature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree —that it’s not wise to , to wed yourself to a particular formulation of\nthat. So we did adopt a discretionary—there ’s an element of discretion in it. You know, it says\nthat we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time. And\nit’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time. And\nthat under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was ,\n2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. You were always getting back to\n2 percent . So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be\ncentered around 2. So , so that’s, that’s the approach that we ’re taking. And you’re right, it ’s\nnot—it’s not a formulaic approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework.\nWas there another part of your question, Craig?\nCRAIG TORRES. T hat pretty much answers it, Chair Powell. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about the\nreverse repo usage that we ’ve seen lately. I was curious if you are at all concerned about the\nlevel of money flowing into the reverse repo facility. And do you believe that the changes in the Fed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that? And then, in a related question, do\n\nyou think that F ed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now\nand creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the —on the facility, we think it’s doing its job. We think it’s\ndoing—the reverse repo facility is , is doing what it ’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor\nunder money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range.\nSo we ’re not concerned with it. It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the T reasury\nGeneral A ccount is , is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there ’s, there’s downward\npressure —we ’re buying assets —there’s downward pressure on short -term rates, and that facility\nis, is doing what we think it ’s supposed to do. Sorry, your second question was again?\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have\nany impact on—do you think that will reduce the , the amount of money coming into reverse\nrepos? Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed\nfunds rate setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. It could have some impact. I think we ’ll have to see empirically.\nBut it ’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range. And I do think it\ncould have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know,\nthe very low rates and the downward pressures.\nMICHAEL DERBY. And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo\nfacility, or that ’s just not even really a focus of what the change was?\nCHAIR POWELL. It ’s not , honestly. And , you know, the funny thing, you would think\nthat it would, but we ’ll have to see. It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case. That ’s\ngoing to be an empiric al question.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Okay, cool. Thank you.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. We ’ll go to Jeanna Smialek , the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I was\nwondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning\nand talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that,\nas you mentioned, is pretty roiled. All the data is prett y—has been pretty roiled by the\npandemic, and we ’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we ’re not sure where\nparticipation is going to settle in. And wages are already looking, you know, decent. So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and , and sort of how you’re thinking about\nthose wage data.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look\nto, and there ’s no one number that we can therefore point to. We look at a range of indicators,\nand it ’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but , but, certainly, it\nwill include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of\nthat. So how do we think about it? A couple of things. We ’re all going to be informed by what\nwe saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period\nof time. Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles , but this was a very long cycle. So\nwe’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different —it’s a\ndifferent economy. We, we have had a slew of retirements , and that may weigh on participation.\nThat, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move\nthrough that window , because they would have —people would have retired anyway, and you’ ll\nbe back where you, you would have been. So I think we ’re—I think that lesson number one is , is\njust to be careful about assessing maximum employment. And I think if you—during the last\ncycle, there were —there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early,\n\nyou know, as , as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed. And , you know —you know, nine years later —\neight years later, we were still creating jobs. And , you know, it was quite remarkable. So we ’re\nall going to be informed by that. At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.\nYou know, the , the demographics are , people are getting older, and that should have a secular\neffect of, of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what , what can be\ndone. But I think we ’re going to be —we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.\nYou asked about wages. You know, we ’re seeing wage increases. That ’s, that’s sort of a\nnatural thing to be seeing in a strong economy. And what we ’re seeing is —we don’t see\nanything that ’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very\nwide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation. In other words,\nwages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across\nthe economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage –price\ncycle. That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation. We\ndon’t see anything like that now. We do see high wages. We see them for , for people who are\nmostly new, you know, entering into n ew jobs, many of them in low -skilled jobs. And, but we ,\nwe do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where , where\nsupply and demand are just not matched up well. And, you know, we think it ’s a flexible\neconomy and, and it will clear. There will —there will be a level at which supply and demand\nmeet. And that’ll—we think that ’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months.\nSo—but the last thing I ’ll say is, again, if you look at , at the forecasts, we are going to be\nin a very st rong labor market pretty quickly here. There are still a big group of unemployed\npeople. And , you know, we ’re not going to forget about them. We ’re going—we’re going to do\neverything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work. But there ’s\n\nevery reason to think that we ’ll be in a —in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low\nunemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum. So that ’s, that’s a little\nbit how we ’re looking at the —at the labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American\nBanker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the\nsupplementary leverage ratio right now. Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently\nadjust this to account for the high growth in deposits? And do you ultimately believe a\npermanent fix is needed? And any information on the timing around that would be —would be\nhelpful.\nCHAIR POWELL. What I can say is , we’re working on it. I don’t have anything to\nshare with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately. But we ’ve,\nwe’ve always —our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the\nleverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage requirements\nare, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk\nones. It ’s a stra ightforward thing. And because of the substantial increase in reserves,\nTreasuries , and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to be come —\nceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be. So we do think it’s\nappropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we ’re\nlooking hard at the issue. We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions\nare necessary to assure that any changes we do make or rec ommend do not erode the overall\nstrength of bank capital requirements. Sorry, I can’t give you any more. That’s just something\nwe’re working on.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, the\nprice jumps we ’ve seen in some raw materials —lumber, for example, you mentioned that\nearlier —seem to be easing. And it looks like we ’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up\nwith demand. But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we ’re going to end up with excess supply\nimmediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we ’re\nrecovering and getting out of the pandemic economy. A nd I wonder how that would affect the\nFed’s outlook at all.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that is really not the problem we ’re having right now. But —\nand, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they\nknow that, you know, they don’t want to build , build capacity and then find out that it ’s not\nnecessary. So , really, the problem now is , is that demand is very, very strong. Incomes are high,\npeople have money in their bank accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn ’t—\nit hasn’t come down. We ’re seeing the service sector reopening. And so you’re seeing prices\nare moving back up off their lows there.\nBut in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there , there is a possibility on the other\nside of this tha t, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward. But that ’s\nnot—that’s not really where our focus is right now. Our focus right now is , we need to —our,\nour expectation is that these , these high inflation readings that we ’re seeing now will start to\nabate. And that ’s, that’s what we think. And it ’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we\nexpect the used car experience to be. With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the\nother two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there ’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up\n\na lot. Because if they are, people will build new hotels. There ’s no reason for supply and\ndema nd to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time. So we think that ’ll\nhappen.\nI think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there ’s a lot of\nuncertainty. The overall story is one that , that we think is right, and we think the incoming data\nsupport it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters. And if you look at the forecasts on the\nFOMC, you will —you will see that as well. But we don’t —we don’t in any way dismiss the\nchance that it can work out that , that this goes on longer than expected. And the risk would be\nthat over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations. And if we see inflation expectations\nand inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we —what we\nwould see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that. Price stability is half of our mandate , and we would certainly do that. We do not\nexpect that , though. That is not our base case.\nAnd, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there ’s a lot to be humble\nabout among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It ’s a—it’s a highly\nuncertain business. And we ’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data\ncarefully. In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there ’s\nso much uncertainty around this. It ’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things\nevolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We ’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Sc hneider, Reuters. Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking\nthis. I don’t want to miss the moment here. And I just —I noticed that in the statement you\ndropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy. So is this the\n\neffective end , in your view , of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though\nit’s still cited as a risk?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it ’s a—it’s a continuum, right? What you’ve seen with\nthe pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations , and deaths. And that ’s great. And ,\nand, you know, that should continue. But , you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom,\nwhich has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the\nDelta variety. And it ’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that. So you’re\nnot—you’re not out of the woods at this point. And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it\nwould be premature to declare victory. Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels —it\nwould be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And , you know, that can only help.\nSo, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving. I would expect it to\ncontinue to evolve. There ’s a lot of judgment in that. But you can expect us to drag our feet a\nlittle bit on that, because that ’s what you do with statement language. It’s, it’s great to see the\nprogress. But , again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the\nreopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. You know,\nwho doesn’t want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to\ncontinue to get vaccinated.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this\nstatement in , in toto and the —and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a\nmark-to -market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see\ndeveloping out there?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it ’s both. You know, I think, clearly, since March what ’s\nhappened is , people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be\n\nachieved. Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved. There ’s, there’s more\ngrounds for comfort. We ’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected. We’ve seen very\nstrong labor demand. We ’ve also seen —we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think\neven though, you know, in, in our forecasters ’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over\n’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate. Nonetheless,\nthe risk is , is something that can factor into people ’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.\nThe thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly\nwhat was in all 18 people ’s mind s. But that , that is something that I think can factor into things\nas well —factor into our forecast as well.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We ’ll go to Victoria Guida with Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I, I want ed to ask a little bit more about inflation\nto make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this. So in the projections, inflation is\nexpected to , to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise\na little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023. You know, I know that ’s obviously—you know,\ntake that with a grain of salt. But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation\nsustainably staying above 2 percent . And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that\ninflation? What , what would be —because it seems like you all now see a situation in which\ninflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the —in the next\ncouple of years. So wou ld that be the result of a tight labor market? Would that be because this\nwhole situation has raised people ’s inflation expectations? How are you thinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we ’re seeing in the near term —again, our base case is that\nwhat we ’re seeing in the near term is , is principally associated with , with the reopening of the\n\neconomy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really. So —but you’re\nright . When, when you get to— in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand\nsides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adapt ive, you know, flexible economy, more\nso than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource\nutilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a\nway to think about it. So that ’s what that ’s about. That’s about the kind of broad inflationary\npressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization\nacross the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. And that ’s why —that’s why you\nwould see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast —and it ’s just a forecast , they’re\njust individual forecasts. In people ’s forecasts, that ’s what ’s happening.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So the , the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you\nall are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this\nwill change the way people think about inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because\ninflation expectations have continued to move up. You know, it ’s all in people ’s individual\nthinking, and you can’t —it’s hard to say. It ’s not something the Committee debates in terms of,\nyou know, what , what the outlook is for 2023. So I ’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I\nshouldn’t do. But it w ouldn’ t surprise me if there ’s an element for some people in, you know,\nseeing the inflation performance that we ’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we\ncould see inflation above 2 percent , that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that\ninflation expectations may move up to a —to a level —they were —they were really at a level that\nwas kind of a little below 2 percent . They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a\nconsequence of, of, of the new framework. Yo u know, we did see inflation expectations moving\n\nup in the —in the wake of the announcement of the framework. But , you know, we don’t really\nknow that. So, ultimately, I think it ’s consistent with both those things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.\nGREG ROBB. Hi . Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I’m just looking\nat the forecast , and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much\nyou guys —the Fed thinks that the econom y is going to slow next year. I mean, are we looking at\na scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation? And , and what do you think\nabout that?\nCHAIR POWELL. We ’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of\nfiscal support . The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year. So —but\nyou’ve , you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the —\nof the economy. You ’ve got —you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower\nnext year in all of our—in all of our forecasts . I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next\nyear is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you’re right, you’re seeing —I, I can’t\nremember the number, but it might be in the 3s —3, 3½ percent growth for next year. That ’s,\nthat’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, t hat’s a really good\nyear. That ’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum. That’ll see—you know, that ’ll cause\nsignificant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent . We didn’ t have a\n3½ percent growth year—w e didn’ t have a 3 percent growth year between the G lobal F inancial\nCrisis and the end of the expansion. So that would be a good year.\nGREGG ROBB. Doesn ’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation—\nwhere that —you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you\nknow, dropping in some way. We haven ’t seen that, right?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the economy’s not , not decel —the economy is still growing,\nand growing at a , at a very healthy rate. Our estimate—I mean, different people have different\nestimates —but , broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at\naround 2 percent per year. If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be\ndeclining, people should be be ing pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of\nthings should be happening, businesses should be investing.\nSo, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that\ninflation will be higher than we think? Yes. As I said earlier, you know, we , we don’t have any\ncertainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening. And therefore we\ndon’t —we don’t think that —we think it ’s unlikely that they would materially affect the\nunderlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century. The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are\naging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that , that we think have,\nhave, you know, really held down inflation. All that’s out there still. You know, when we get through this, we may well —we’ll be facing those same forces. Nonetheless, is there a ri sk that\ninflation will remain higher than we —than we thought? Yes. And if, if we see inflation moving\nabove our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently —or persistently\nenough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tool s to address that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Going to Brian Che ung with Yahoo.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Chair Powell, Brian Che ung, Yahoo Finance. On that point, you\ntalked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity. I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5 percent . But there ’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis\n\ncould have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe\nchanged productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher. What would the\nimplications of that be for monetary policy? Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the\npossibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate? And what might be the impact of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher\nby that amount. And , and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy,\nbecause it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with , with interest rates\nbeing close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central\nBank, their, their policy rate was well below zero whe n, when the pandemic hit. So we don’t\nwant to be in a place where we can ’t react. A higher neutral rate would, would be —from that\nnarrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room and, therefore ,\nthen, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You know, we,\nit’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision. I think we would be alert to—I\nmean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself. And I, I think we would be alert to\nfactors t hat might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest. And, you know, we , we try to keep up\nwith that. And I think we ’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that. You\nknow, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could —that essentially could lead\nto higher productivity growth and higher r*. We don’ t know which of those stories will come\ntrue. But , I mean, I’ll give you an example. It ’s just there are—there are a lot of start -ups, a lot\nof early-stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don’t know. But we ’ll be\nwatching those things carefully.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. For the last question, we ’ll go to Michael\nMcKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, of c ourse you’ll be shocked to learn that you have\nsome critics on Wall Street. And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get\nyour reaction to them. One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and\ndo not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the\nforecast that it will cool down in order to make policy. I wanted to get your view on how you square that. Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with\nannouncements. But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a\ntaper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper? And , finally,\nyou’ve said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy.\nAnd there ’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to\nraise rates too quickly.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s a—that’s a few questions there. So let me say , first, I think\npeople misinterpret the framework. I think the —there ’s nothing wrong with the framework, a nd\nthere ’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to\npursue our, our goals. That ’s for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and\nplanning are taking place in the context of our new framework. We ’re strongly committed to it,\nwe think it ’s well suited to our goals, including in this —in this unique time. And I think if you\nlook at the —look at the forecasts that we ’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly\nbehind them. The forecasts are all consistent with that.\nYou know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve? And, you\nknow, that ’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all. The situation that we, we addressed in\n\nour—in our S tatement on L onger-Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy was a situation in\nwhich employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low. And what we said was, we\nwouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if\nthere was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances. So that ’s what we said.\nThat is not at all the current situation. In the current si tuation, we have many millions of\npeople who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target. The question\nwe face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework. It ’s a very different, very\ndifficult version of a standard i nvestment —sorry, a central banking question. And that is, how\ndo you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that , that follow from broad upward\nprice pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a\nparticular —due to particular things? I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example,\nwas the cellphone price war back in 2017. If you remember, there was —prices were incredibly\nlow, and it held down core PCE by three -tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out. So\nthis is much bigger than that. And , of course, it ’s not —it’s not easy to tell in real time which is\nwhich, but that ’s, that’s the question you would face under, really , any framework. And, you\nknow, we ’re trying to sort that out. I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about\nthat. And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane. We\ncan’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we ’re prepared to use our tools as\nappropriate.\nYour second one was? Oh , you know, we will —we will taper when we feel that the\neconomy has achieved substantial furthe r progress. And we will communicate very carefully in\nadvance on that. And that ’s what we ’re doing. That ’s what we ’re going to do, and, and we will\nfollow through on that. There ’s no —I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction.\n\nBut, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will —we will taper as\nappropriate.\nThe third thing was —what was the third thing?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy.\nAnd the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far.\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s right. And we —look, we have to balance the two —the two\ngoals: maximum employment and price stability. Often they are—they do pull in the sam e\ndirection, of course. But when we —when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there ’s no\nquestion that has an effect on activity. And that ’s the channel —one of the channels through\nwhich we get to inflation. We don’t think that we’re in a situa tion like that right now. We think\nthat the economy is recovering from a deep hole —an unusual hole , actually, because it ’s to do\nwith, with shutting down the economy. It turns out it ’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand\nthan it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff. That ’s happening all over the world.\nThere ’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely. But we’re going, you know,\nwe’re going to watch carefully to make sure that , that evolving inflation and our understanding\nof what ’s happening is , is, is right. And in the meantime, we ’ll conduct policy appropriately.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair."
