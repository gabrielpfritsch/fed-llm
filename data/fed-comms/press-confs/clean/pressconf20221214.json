  "text": "December 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nDecember 14 , 2022\n\nCHAIR POWELL . Good afternoon . Before I go into the details of today ’s meeting, I\nwould like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high\ninflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal . Over the course of the year, we have tak en forceful actions to tighten the stance\nof monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility\nof the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy . Without price stability, the\neconomy doesn’ t work for anyone . In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point . We continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time . In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet . Restoring price\nstability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time . I will have\nmore to say about today ’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nThe U.S . economy has slowed significantly from last year ’s rapid pace. Although real\nGDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three\nquarters of this y ear. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this\nquarter . Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year ’s rapid pace, in part reflecting\nlower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions . Activity in the housing sector has\nweakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates . Higher interest rates and\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nslower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment . As shown in our\nSummary of Economic Projections, the median p rojection for real GDP growth stands at just\n0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer -run normal\ngrowth rate.\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month\nover the last three months . Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace\nof job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance,\nwith demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers . The labor force\nparticipation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year . FO MC participants expect\nsupply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing\nupward pressures on wages and prices . The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment\nrate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent . Over the 12 months\nending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent . In November, the 12- month change in the CPI was\n7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent . The inflation data received so far for\nOctober and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases . But it\nwill take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia’ s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to\nupward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\n5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in\n2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency; the lo nger the\ncurrent bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the Amer ican people . My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highl y attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n½ perc entage point, bringing the target range to 4 ¼ to 4½ percent . And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nWith today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 4 ¼ percentage points this year . We\ncontinue to a nticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be\nappropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time . Over the course of the year, fi nancial conditions have tightened\nsignificantly in response to our policy actions . Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in\nresponse to many factors, but it is important that , over time , they reflect the policy restraint that\nwe are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent . We are seeing the effects on demand in\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nthe most interest -sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing . It will take time, however,\nfor the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation . In light of the\ncumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects\neconomic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step -down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings . Of\ncourse, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go.\nAs shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds\nrate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than projected in September .\nThe median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer -run value . Of course , these projections do not represent\na Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now . Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their\nimplications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. And we will continue to make\nour decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.\nWe are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment\nwith supply. Our o verarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored . Reducing inflation\nis likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions . Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run . The historical record cautions strongly\nagainst prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course u ntil the job is done.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country . Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -emplo yment and price -stability goals .\nThank you. I will look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Steve .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman, CNBC . Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman . You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy\nrestraint you put in place . Since the November meeting, the 10- year has declined by 60 basis\npoints, mortgage rates have come down, high- yield credit spreads have come in, the economy ’s\naccelerated, and the stock market ’s up 6 percent . Is this loosening of financial conditions a\nproblem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight , against inflation? And, if so, do you need to do\nsomething about that? And how would you do something about that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions\ncontinue to reflect the policy restraint that we ’re putting in place to bring inflation down to\n2 percent . We thi nk that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year . But\nour policy actions work through financial conditions . And those, in turn, affect economic\nactivity, the labor market, and inflation . So what we control is our policy moves i n the\ncommunications that we make . Financial conditions both anticipate , and react to , our actions .\nI would add that our focus is not on short -term moves , but on persistent moves . And\nmany, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time . I would say it ’s our\njudgment today that we ’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say\nthat we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate . And I would point you to the\nSEP again for our current assessment of what t hat peak level will be. As you will have seen,\n19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or\nmore —in the 5s . So that ’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nYou will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we ’ve\nactually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be . And today we ’re—the SEP th at\nwas published shows again that , overwhelmingly , FOMC participants believe that inflation ris ks\nare to the upside . So I can ’t tell you confidently that we won’ t move up our estimate of the peak\nrate again at the next SEP . I don’ t know what we ’ll do. It will depend on future data . What\nwe’re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be , based on\nwhat we know . Obviously, if data —if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up .\nAnd it could move down if inflation data are softer.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Tim es. Thanks for taking our\nquestions . The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the F ed will be making another\n¾ percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023 . I wonder if you would foresee that being in\n25 basis point increments, 50 basis point inc rements —sort of how you see the speed playing out\ngoing forward. And then I wonder what you’ re looking at as you determine when to stop.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as I ’ve been saying, as we’ ve gone through the course of this\nyear, as we lifted off and got into t he course of the year and we saw the— how strong inflation\nwas and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed —the pace with\nwhich we ’re moving was the most important thing . I think now that we ’re coming to the end of\nthis ye ar, we ’ve raised 425 basis points this year , and we ’re into restrictive territory .\nIt’s now not so important how fast we go. It’ s far more important to think , what is the\nultimate level? And then it’ s—at a certain point, the question will become , how long do we\nremain restrictive ? That will become the most important question . But I would say the most\nimportant question now is no longer the speed. So —and that applies to February as well . So I\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nthink we ’ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial\nconditions, where we see the economy. And that ’ll be the key thing, but —I mean, for that\ndecision.\nBut, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we\nmake looking at our progres s on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are , and making\nan assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough . [As] I ’ve told you today, we have an\nassessment that we’ re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today ’s move . And we ’ve\nlaid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there . At a\ncertain point, though, we ’ll get to that point. And then the question will be , how long do we\nstay there ?\nAnd there, the strong view on the Committee is that we ’ll need to stay there, you know,\nuntil we ’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way. And we think that\nthat will be some time . Now, why do I say that? If you look at —you can break inflation down\ninto three , sort of , buckets . The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we ’ve been\nexpecting, really , for a year and a half , that supply conditions would get better . And, ultimately,\nsupply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a\nlittle bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We’ re now starting to see that in\nthis report and the last one .\nThen you go to housing services . We know the story there is that housing services\ninflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually. A s rents expire and have\nto be renewed, they’ re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were\nwhen the original leases were signed . But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for\nnew leases is coming down . So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ncome down sometime next year . The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the\nindex, PCE core inflation index, is non- housing- related core services. And that ’s really a\nfunction of the labor market, largely. The biggest cost , by far , in that sector is labor. And we do\nsee a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’ t seen much softening, where job\ngrowth is very high, where wages are very high. Vacancies are quite elevated , and, really,\nthere ’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is\nthe biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.\nThe other —you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning\nat all for a year and a half . Now it seems to be turning . But there ’s an expectation, really, that\nthe services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we ’ll have to stay at it, so that w e\nmay have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go . And that ’s really why we are\nwriting down those high rates and why we ’re expecting that they ’ll have to remain high for\na time .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Howard .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters . Thanks for taking the\nquestion. You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe . Yet it ’s\nreally approaching stall speed . Half a percentage point is not much . You described labor market\nunemployment rate as represent ing some softening. But it’ s nearly a full percentage point rise,\nand that ’s well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession . Why wouldn’ t\nthis be considered a recessionary projection by the F ed?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I ’ll tell you what the projection is . I don’ t think it would\nqualify as a recession, though, because you’ ve got positive growth. The expectations in the SEP\nare basically as you said, which is, we ’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\n½ percentage poi nt, that ’s positive growth. It’ s slow growth. It’ s well below trend . It’s not\ngoing to feel like a boom . It’s going to feel like very slow growth, right ?\nIn that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit . Unemployment does go up\na bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually\nelevated at this moment . So it ’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above\nthe natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision . But\nthat 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.\nIf you look —you know, you’ ve got —the reports we get from the field are that companies\nare very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story\nunto itself . Generally , companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it ’s been\nvery, very hard to hire . So you’ ve got all these vacancies out there— far in excess of the number\nof employed people . That doesn ’t sound like a —you know, a labor market where a lot of people\nwill need to be put out of work. So that we —you know, there are channels through which the\nlabor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe. None of that is guarant eed, but that is what their forecast reflects .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nick .\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Thanks . Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, I want\nto follow up on Jeanna ’s question. The decision to step down the pace of rate increase —rate\nrises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports\nshowed inflation decelerating in line with the C ommittee ’s forecasts this year . You just now\ntalked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy . Does\nthat mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting?\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL . So I haven’ t made a judgment on wha t size rate hike to make at the\nlast meeting . But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is , having moved so quickly\nand having now so much restraint that ’s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing\nto do now is to move to a slower pace . And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and—\nyou know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face . So that ’s the\nidea. It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me—particularly if you consider how far we ’ve come .\nBut, again, I can’ t tell you today what the actual size of that will be . It will depend on a variety\nof factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of\nfinancial conditions .\nNICK TIMIRAOS . With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it\nwould have changed some of those forecasts in today’ s estimate?\nCHAIR POWELL . No . Absolutely not . No . As a —just a matter of practice, the SEP\nreflects any data that ’s—that comes out during the meeting. And participants know that they\nhave the —they know this —that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you\nknow, well in advance of the press conference so that we’ re not running around. But that ’s not\nthe case. It ’s never the case that the SEPs don ’t reflect an important piece of data that came in\non the first day of the meeting .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Rachel .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post . Thank\nyou for taking our questions . I’m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the\nunemployment rate . Why has the F ed raised its unemployment projection? Is it because the\nmodel suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nrate? Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn ’t quite as strong as we think it is now?\nThanks .\nCHAIR POWELL . No . It’s not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market\nis clearly very strong. It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we ’ve\ncontinually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately. And that ’s\nwhy the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You\nsee that —you see the fact that we’ ve made less progress than expected on inflation. So that ’s\nwhy that goes up. And that ’s why unemployment goes up, because we’ re having to tighten\npolicy more . And so it didn’ t go up by much in the meeting, I don’ t think . But that ’s the idea , is\nslower progress on inflation, ti ghter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to\nget to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent .\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of\nthat could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force\npopulation rate?\nCHAIR POWELL . It’s very hard to say. You know, there —you can look at history,\nright ? And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like t his, the declines in\nunemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there . But\nwhy do we think that is the case? So , I’ll give you a few reasons . First just is that there ’s this\nhuge overhang of vacancies, meaning that va cancies can come down a fair amount . And we ’re\nhearing from many companies that they don’ t want to lay people off —so that they’ ll keep people\nbecause it ’s been so hard .\nI mean, I think we ’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there wher e\nthere are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nworkforce available to work than there ’s demand for workforce . So the fact that there’ s a strong\nlabor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to worke rs. And it means that it\nmay take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less . Again, that\nwe’re going to find out empirically . But I think that ’s a reasonably possible outcome. And you\ndo hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is . So we ’ll see, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times . How should we\ninterpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP? Does that not then suggest that\nthe policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 medi an\nestimate penciled in?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I think that’ s why one of the reasons it went up was that core\ncame in stronger thi s year . Yeah . What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of\ntoday—for how high we need to raise rates to— how much we need to tighten policy to create\nenough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow —soften the labor\nmarket and bring inflation down through those channels . That ’s all—that is the estimate —best\nestimate—we make today. And, as I mentioned, we ’ll make another estimate for the next SEP .\nAnd we ’ll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don’ t\npublish it .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Victoria .\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a with Politico . I wanted to make sure I\nunderstand specifically what ’s going on in the SEP , because you all expect rates to go higher, but\nyou’re also more pessim istic about what inflation is going to look like next year . And I was just\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nwondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it —is that\nprimarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwi nd?\nCHAIR POWELL . We’ re going into next year with higher inflation than we had\nthought, right ? So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we ’re moving down to next\nyear is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than\n1 percent change in inflation . But remember that the jump [ing]- off point at the beginning of the\nyear is higher . So, you know, we —we ’re moving down still by a very large chunk. I don ’t think\nit’s having —I don’ t think the policy is having any less effect . It’s just starting from a higher\nlevel at the end of 2022. So we ’re getting down. I believe the median is 3 ½ percent . That\nwould be —that ’s a pretty significant drop in inflation .\nAnd, you know, where ’s it coming from? It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly. By\nthe middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector .\nAnd then, you know, the big question is, when we —how much will you see from the largest, the\n55 percent of the index, which is the non- housing services sector ? And, you know, that ’s where\nyou need to see —we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in t he\nlabor market so that you have —it’s not that we don’ t want wage increases. We want strong\nwage increases. We just want them to be at a level that ’s consistent with 2 percent inflation .\nRight now that —if you put into— if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity\nestimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Neil .\nNEIL IRWIN . Thanks . Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios . Some of your\ncolleag ues have been pretty explicit that they can ’t imagine rate cuts happening in 2023. That ’s\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ncertainly not implied by the SEP . But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back\nhalf of next year . What ’s your view of the likelihood of any kind of r ate cuts next year? What\ncircumstances might make that plausible?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance\nto one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time .\nIt’s not on rate cuts. And we think that we ’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for\nsome time . Historical experience caution s strongly against prematurely loosening policy . I\nguess I would say it this way: I wouldn’ t see us considering rate cu ts until the Committee is\nconfident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way. So that ’s the test I\nwould articulate . And you’ re correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Steve .\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg . Let me ask you about China .\nIn the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty\nstrongly. I’m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you’ re seeing supply chains\nimprove or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the\nglobal outlook for growth and for commodities prices .\nCHAIR POWELL . So you’ re right . Those two things will offset each other . Weaker\noutput in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains\nultimately . And that could push inflation up in the West . It’s very hard to say, you know, how\nmuch—how those two will offset each other. And it doesn ’t seem likely, actually, that the\noverall ne t effect would be material on us . But, to your point, China faces a very challenging\nsituation in reopening. You know, we ’ve seen , waves of COVID all around the world can\ninterfere with economic activity . China, a very critical manufacturing —place for m anufacturing\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nand exporting. Their supply chain is very important . And China faces a reopening. They ’ve—\nyou know, they’ ve backed away from their COVID r estriction policies . There could be very\nsignificant increases in COVID . And we ’ll just have to see . It’s a risky situation . It—but,\nagain, it doesn’ t seem like it ’s likely to have material overall effects on us .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Hi . Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Thank you for taking my\nquestion. I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday’ s inflation report. I\nmean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings .\nAre you starting to see —are you confident that you’ re seeing real progress on getting inflatio n\nunder control? Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know,\nupward spiral? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So the data that we’ ve received so far for October and\nNovember, we don’ t have the —some of the —we have some remaining data to get in November,\nbut they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases . As I\nmentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained down ward path. So the way we think about this is this: This\nreport is very much in line with what we ’ve been expecting and hoping for . And what it does is ,\nit provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation .\nAs I mentioned, we ’ve been expecting significant —forecasting significant declines in\noverall inflation and core inflation in the coming year . And this is the kind of reading that it will\ntake to support that . So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than , at\nthis point , changing our forecast . In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation\nto come down as supply chain pressures eased . That’s happening now . Housing services —as I\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nmentioned, there ’s good news in the pipeline . As long as hous ing—new housing leases show\ndeclining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year . So that\nshould help. And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important .\nAnd we have a ways to go there . You do see some beginning signs there .\nBut, ultimately, that ’s the big —the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index .\nAnd it ’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages . If you look at wages, look at the\naverage hourly earnings number w e got with the last payrolls report, you don’ t really see much\nprogress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now, there may be composition\neffects and other effects in that. So we don’ t put too much weight on any one report . These\nthings can be volatile month to month. But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . The re’s a—excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio\nand Television. There ’s a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just\nexpressed about the economy and the changes that you’ ve made in the SEP . And I ’m wondering\nif you’ re reacting t o the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the\nFed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we ’re seeing is\ntransitory or not , and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you’ re projecting just\n½ percent growth for this year.\nCHAIR POWELL . So if I—I think I got your question. So, you know, one thing is to\nsay is, I think our polic y’s in—getting into a pretty good place now . We’ re restrictive, and I\nthink we ’re—you know, we ’re getting close to that level of sufficient— we think—sufficiently\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nrestrictive . We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there . And, I mean, it boils\ndown to, how long do we think this process is going to take? And, of course, we ’re—we\nwelcome these better inflation reports for the last two months . They ’re very welcome . But I\nthink we ’re realistic about the broader project . So that ’s all. That’s the point I would make .\nIt’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen\nwith housing services . But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there ’s not much\nprogress there . And that ’s going to take some time . I think my view and my colleagues ’ view is\nthat this will take some time . We ’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained\nperiod so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very\nwelcome. Of course, they’ re very welcome . But we need to be honest with ourselves that\nthere ’s, you know, inflation—12- month core inflation is 6 percent CPI . That ’s three times our\n2 percent target . Now, it ’s good to see progress . But let ’s just understand we have a long ways\nto go to get back to price stability.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?\nCHAIR POWELL . No, I wouldn’ t say that . No . I don’ t say that . I mean, I would say\nthis: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway. But lower\ninflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible . So I just —I\ndon’t think anyone knows whether we ’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether\nit’s going to be a deep one or not . It’s just , it’s not knowable . And certainly, you know, lower\ninflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a —\nput it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in\nunemployment than would be expected given the historical record.\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Brian .\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Ch eung, NBC News . You warned\nAmericans of pain earlier this year as the F ed hikes rates . But with the Fed now expected to\nraise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that\npain. How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves —that ’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?\nCHAIR POWELL . So the largest amount of pain —the worst pain would come from a\nfailure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of\nemployment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the F ed didn’ t respond\naggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago. So that ’s\nreally —the worst pain would be if we failed to act .\nWhat we’ re doing now is, you know, it ’s raising interest rates for people . And so people\nare paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing. There will be some softening in\nlabor market conditions . And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price\nstability . There isn ’t. And this is the best we can do . I do think, though, that —and markets are\npretty confident, it seems to me —that we will get in flation under control . And I believe we will.\nWe’re certainly highly committed to do that .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Grady.\nGRADY TRIMBLE . Thank you, Mr . Chair . Grady Trimble with Fox Business . You ’ve\nreiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ntarget. I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe\nincrease your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?\nCHAIR POWELL . That ’s just —so , changing our inflation goal is just something we ’re\nnot thinking about, and it ’s something we ’re not going to think about . It’s—we have a 2 percent\ninflation goal, and we ’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent . I think this isn ’t the time\nto be thinking about that . I mean, there may be a longer -run project at some point. But that is\nnot where we are at all . The Committee —we ’re not considering that . We ’re not going to\nconsider that under any circumstances . We’ re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent .\nWe’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nicole .\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell . Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nBusiness. As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you ’re paying close\nattention to a sector or even income level? Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of\ninequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K -shaped recovery of 2020?\nCHAIR POWELL . So the —I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018,\n’19, ’20. So , what that looked like was , wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the\nincome spectrum were the largest . The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at\ntheir smallest in reco rded history . That ’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight\nlabor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the\neconomy growing right at its potential .\nSo that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the\ncountry, if we could get back to that . And so that ’s what all of us want to do. We want to get\nback to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\ntime. That ’s a really good thing for workers in the economy. And we ’d love to get back to that .\nThat’s what our goal is . You know, there ’s—in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore\nprice stability . But we , you know, we can’ t—what we have to think about is the medium and\nlonger term .\nIf you think about it, the country went through a difficult time —I think much more\ndifficult than we can think it would happen here . But it really set up our economy for several\ndecades of prosperity . So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of\nthe economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time . And so when it is lost,\nfor whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—wh ich is what we’ re doing.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. In the short term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or\npotential exacerbations in the economy? Are you monitoring them?\nCHAIR POWELL . We do, yes . We absolutely do. We look at —it’s our regular practice\nto talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of\nthing. We do . We keep our eye on that .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. What\nwould you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong\nconsistent signs that inflation is slowing—in other words, stagflation?\nCHAIR POWELL . So I don’ t want to get into too many hypotheticals . But, you know,\nwe’ll—it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals . So let me just say that we have to use our tools to\nsupport maximum employment and price stability . I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor\nmarket’ s very, very strong. You’re near a 50 -year low where you’ re at or above maximum\nemplo yment , a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages —nominal wages\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nare very high. So the labor market ’s very, very strong. Where we’ re missing is on the inflation\nside. And we ’re missing by a lot on the inflation side . So that means we need to really focus on\ngetting inflation under control, and that ’s what we’ ll do. I think, as the economy heals, the two\ngoals come more into play. But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Greg .\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell . Greg Robb from MarketWatch . You\nspoke a little bit ago. You said that the U .S. looks —it looks like we have a structural labor\nshortage in the economy. Could you expand on that , talk a little bit more about that? And,\nreally, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration,\nthings like that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So, what I meant by that, with “ structural labor shortage ,” is, if you\nlook at where we are now, as I mentioned , there —if you just look at demand for labor, you can\nlook at vacancies plus people who are actually working. And then you can take supply of labor\nby, “A re you in the labor market? ” “Are you looking for a job or have a job? ” And you’ re 4—\nmore than 4 million people short . We don’ t see— despite very high wages and an incredibly\ntight labor market, we don’ t see participation moving up —which is contrary to what we thought .\nSo the upshot of all that is , the labor market is actually —it should —it’s 3½ million\npeople , at least , smaller than it should have been based on pre -pandemic . Just assume population\nand reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3½ million more\nthan it is . And that —there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back\na few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements . People dropped out\nand aren ’t coming back at a higher rate than expected . Part of it is that we lost a half a million\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\npeople who would have been work—close to half a million who would have been working died\nfrom COVID . And part of it is that migration has been lower .\nWe don’ t prescribe—you know, it ’s not our job to prescribe things . But, you know, I\nthink if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’ t\nenough people . We need more people . So I tried to identify that in my —in a speech I gave a\nmonth ago, but I stopped short of telling Congre ss what to do because, you know, they gave us a\njob. And we need to, you know, do that job.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thanks . Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell . Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance . You say you expect growth of just ½ percent next year . Given that you’ ve said\nthe process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful , have you had\ndiscussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you\nwould be willing to ac cept?\nCHAIR POWELL . No . I mean, what we do is , we make our forecasts, and we publish\nthem quarterly . And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow\ngrowth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up a lot . You see inflation\ncoming down. Those are those forecasts, and that ’s really what they show .\nWe’re not —of course, we don’ t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that\nkind of a recession. We just , you know, we make those forecasts . The staff runs —and you will\nsee this if you look at the old Tealbooks —runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at\nevery meeting, and we look at those , too. An d those will explore different things . But that ’s\njust, you know, upside and downside scenarios . Of course, that ’s a responsible practice that\n\nDecember 14 , 2022 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference \n\nwe’ve carried on for many decades . But, no, we don’ t—we haven ’t asked ourselves that\nquestion.\nMICHELLE SMITH . We’ ll go to Jean for the last question.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi . Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask about the SEP again.\nIf you’ re reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to\ndecline materially, that w ould seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive . Is that\nsomething that ’s built into the projections and into models? Is that something you would want\nto see?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we do know that . Of course, that ’s something that we know we ’d\nsee. But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’ t—I wouldn’ t see the Committee cutting rates\nuntil we ’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way. That would be my test . I\ndon’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and\nwhat real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that . It would—really , it’ll be a test\nof—for cutting rates, I think, in the event , it’ll be a question of , do we actually feel confident that\ninflation is coming down in a sustained way?\nThank you very much."
