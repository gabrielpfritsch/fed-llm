  "text": "June 10, 2020\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone , and thanks for joining us. Our country\ncontinues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous\nhardship here in the United States and around the world. People have lost loved ones. Many millions have lost their jobs. There is great uncertainty about the future. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can—and for as long as it takes— to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as\npossible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.\nThe most important response to this crisis has come from our health -care workers. And\non behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselve s at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation. Let\nme also thank the many other essential workers across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services in these difficult times.\nThe virus and the forceful measur es taken to control its spread have induced a sharp\ndecline in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real GDP in the current quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. Even after the unexpectedly positive M ay employment report, nearly\n20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about\n10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Stati stics, this\nfigure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points. The downt urn has not fallen equally on all\nAmericans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the most affected. In\n\nparticular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers, for women,\nand for African Americans and Hispan ics.\nIn recent weeks, some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in\nsome segments of the economy, such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle sales.\nEmployment rose in many sectors of the economy in May, and the unemployment [rate] edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from temporary layoffs. With the easing of social -\ndistancing restrictions across the country, people are increasingly moving about, and many businesses are resuming operations to varying degrees. At the s ame time, many households have\nbeen receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits, which are supporting incomes and spending. Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up, however, and overall output is far below earlier levels. Moreo ver, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs\nreport, unemployment remains historically high.\nWeak demand, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic, is holding down\nconsumer prices. As a result, inflation has fallen well below our symmetri c 2 percent objective.\nIndicators of longer -term inflation expectations have been fairly steady.\nThe extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and\nwill depend in large part on our success in containing the virus. We all want to get back to\nnormal, but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes.\nThe Fed’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and\nstable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of\n\nthe financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy\nin this challenging time. In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, where we expect to keep it until we are confident th at the economy has weathered recent events\nand is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nWe have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the\neconomy. Without access to credit, families co uld be forced to cut back on necessities or even\nlose their homes. Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn. Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery.\nSince March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency\nmortgage -backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which\nare vital to the flow of credit in the economy. Our ongoing purchases have helped to restore\norderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As\nmarket functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually\nreduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities ov er coming months at least at\nthe current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.\nThe Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial\nsystem and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy— for households, for\nbusinesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments. These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available. In addition, by s erving as a\n\nbackstop to key credit markets, the programs can increase the willingness of private lenders to\nextend credit. Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as these— those we find ourselves in today. We are\ndeploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury. We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and a ggressively until we ’re confident that we are solidly on the\nroad to recovery. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.\nI would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant\nmoney to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based\neligibility to make loans to solvent entity —entities with the expectation that the loans will be\nrepaid. Many borrowers will benefit from thes e programs, as will the overall economy. But for\nmany others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases,\ndirect fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to\nmake decisio ns about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The\nCARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people and businesses and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a\ntime of need, but also in limiting long -lasting damage to our economy.\nAt this meeting, my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for\nconducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound. The measu res we\ndiscussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset purchases. We used these tools\nin the aftermath of the G lobal F inancial C risis, and they have become a standard part of our\ntoolkit. We also reviewed the historical and foreign experi ence with targeting interest rates\n\nalong the yield curve. Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools\nremains an open question. We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will\nevaluate our monetary policy stance and c ommunications as more information about the\ntrajectory of the economy becomes available.\nWe also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or the SEP.\nThe SEP is an input into our deliberations, not an outcome, and it does not represe nt a\nCommittee view. Rather, FOMC participants write down their individual views of the most\nlikely path for the economy, conditioned on each participant’s view of appropriate monetary\npolicy. We tabulate those submissions , and we publish them as the SEP . Given the unusually\nhigh level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy, and that it ’s not possible to identify with confidence a\nsingle path as the “most likely” one. N onetheless, we believe that regular publication of the SEP\nprovides a useful perspective on the way FOMC participants are assessing the path ahead.\nWhat the June SEP shows is a general expectation of an economic recovery beginning in\nthe second half of thi s year and lasting over the next couple of years, supported by interest rates\nthat remain at their current level, near zero. Of course, my colleagues and I will continue to base our policy decisions on the full range of plausible outcomes and not on a par ticular forecast. The\nrisk-management approach—t his risk -management approach is the best way we can promote our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals in these unusually uncertain circumstances.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the\npain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate\nin, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themsel ves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues\n\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve\nfor racism and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity\nto participate fully in our society and in our economy.\nThese principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diversity\nand inclusion in our workplace and to our work to ensure fair access to credit across the country. We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles. We\nunderstand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to us ing our\nfull range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\nThank you. I look forward to our questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. For the first question, Nick Timiraos.\nNICK TIMI RAOS. Yes, hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at t he Wall Street\nJournal . I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an\neducated guess at this point, but they suggest the Committee sees quite a large output gap o ver\nthe next two years. And yet the Committee did not take any steps to date to—to reinforce your\nforward guidance. And so my questions are , first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting?\nSecond, how might that change your response? And, third, how cl ose is the Committee to\nreaching a decision on a —a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might\nreinforce that guidance?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is\ncurrently well positioned to support t he economy in this challenging time. If we didn’ t think\nthat, of course, we would change our policy now. As you know, we —we lowered our policy rate\n\nvery quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound. And we ’ve said that\nwe’ll keep it there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to\nachieve our goals. You can see that in —in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that\noverwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at\nleast through 2022. And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the\neffective lower bound.\nSo the first thing is, monetar y policy is in a good place , and it ’s—that ’s well understood\nin the markets. Secondly, we ’ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the\neconomy, as I mentioned. And , third, we ’re continuing asset prices in coming months at —at a —\nat a relatively high level.\n1 So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place.\nSo as we look ahead, we see that the path for the —ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and\ncontinues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic.\nSo, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we —we looked in some depth at\nforward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those. We also received a briefing\non the historical experience with yield curve control. And we’ll continue those discussions in\nupcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion —more —\nmore information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. I—I would just say, in\nterms of —of what we ’re looking for, we —we expect to get a better understanding of the\neconomy’ s trajectory and, particularly , how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those\ngoals. So that ’s really what we ’re looking to achieve , and, as you can see, we ’re—we ’re actively\nat work on that.\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say “asset purchases” rather than “asset prices.”\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Next, Jeanna .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our question s.\nI’m—I’m curious about your inflation forecast s, which are —are pretty low across the forecast\nhorizon. I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy\nappropriate now , and why not just kind of throw everything you can—you know, everything and\nthe kitchen sink at it currently? And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency\nyou see in —in returning it back to that 2 percent target.\nCHAIR POWELL. Our current policy stance is appropriate. And remember, we ’re\nusing—we ’re using our —our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent. We\nhave asset purchases, and we ’ve now said that we won’ t go any lower than this , and—but —but\nthat we ’re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound. So we\nhave all of our tools in— in use in a strong way. And so what we ’re—what we ’re waiting for is\nto—is to learn more. I—I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it ’s a pretty\ngood—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember. It ’s a pretty good\nillustration of just how uncertain these times are. The economy is reopeni ng. We’re going to\nlearn a whole lot about the —the path of the economy in the next —in coming months . So that ’s\nreally what we’ re—what we ’re looking for.\nIn terms of inflation, you ’ll know that we —we had a 128- month expansion , and we never\ndid quite get inflation back to 2 percent on a symmetric, sustained basis. We got close for the\nlast couple of years, but we never did quite get there. So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is —is going to be above most\nestimates of the natural rate for —certainly above the median in our —in our —in our SEP well\nthrough the end of —past the end of 2022. So I do—I think we ’re in the right place now . We—\n\nwe are looking carefully a t what the —as we learn more and —and better understand the —the\npath of the economy, we will be assessing, what ’s the best way to deploy all of our tools to\nachieve our goals in the best possible way ?\nAnd I ’ll—I’ll just say again that we are —the —the May empl oyment report, of course,\nwas a—was a welcome surprise, very pleased. We hope we get many more like it . But I think\nwe have to be honest . It’s a—it ’s a long road. I t’s—it’ s, depending on how you count it, well\nmore than 20 million people displaced in the labor market . It’s going to take some time . And\nwe are going to be deploying our tools —all of our tools , to their full extent, in pursuit of that —of\nthose goals, however long it takes.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I understand how the Fed might\nreact in the event things come out worse than expected. I think I don’ t understand how you\nmight react if things come out better than expected —kind of a variant on these other questions.\nHow firm is the commitment to lower interest rates? And if things end up better, do you stick\nwith these low interest rates, as you —as you projected them? And —or is it specific points that\nyou have in mind— for example, unemployment or inflation —that is animating where you might\ngo? And what are those numbers that you’ re looking for that might cause you to change about\nthe policy as it now is projected?\nCHAIR POWELL. I would start with —tha t’s where I would start. I would say, you\nknow, we were —we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the —well\nbelow 4 percent , hanging around 3½ percent , that lasted two years. And during that period of\ntime, we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we ’d love to get\nback to. We didn’ t see any problems with price inflation. P rice inflation didn’ t really react\n\nmuch. So, I would say, you know, we ’d be looking to get inflation back up, and we —we ’d be\nprepared to tolerate pretty low —welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings\non—on unemployment just based on what we —what we saw in the last —in the last expansion.\nSo, you know , we’re—we ’re not thinking about raising rates. We’re not even t hinking\nabout thinking about raising rates. So what we ’re thinking about is —is providing support for\nthis economy. We do think this is going to take some time. I think most forecasters believe that.\nIt would be great if —if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that . Not—\nnotwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are —there are just a lot of people that are\nunemployed . And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of —\neven —even after a lot of strong job growth, that ’ll still be struggling to find jobs, and we ’ll still\nbe providing strong accommodation for that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, t hank you. James.\nJAMES POLITI. Thanks very much, Chair Powell. There have been plenty of\ncomparisons with the Great Dep ression of the 1930s since the crisis began. I mean , is that\nscenario sort of got [ten] more dire as data comes out and we ’re looking at a more traditional and\nsudden recession? And are you at all concerned that the performance —the strong performance\nin the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think that the —that the Great Depression is a good example\nor a likely outcome or a model for what ’s happening here at all . I really don ’t. And there —ther e\nare just so many fundamental differences. First, the government response has been so fast and so\nforceful . The origin was quite different. This was a very —an economy that was in a healthy\nplace. Of course, every economy has longer -run challenges, not —and that —that includes our\neconomy, notwithstanding that 50 -year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our\n\nhistory and every reason to think it could continue. So that ’s different from what was happening\naround the time of the Great —the Dep ression started. The financial system this time was in —\nwas in —was in very good shape, much better capitalized. So, you know, it ’s just not the right\nmodel.\nI would say, we’re learning . You know, every month that passes, we ’re seeing more,\nwe’re learning more. And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in\nlearning what the —what the real story will be, because we’ ll see the— the significant incoming\ndata about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy. You know —and I\nwould say, assuming that the —that the —that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under\ncontrol, I think that what you see is a —is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then\nan—an expansion that builds momentum over time.\nPeople will adju st, probably a little bit gradually , to some of the activities that would —\nthat involve getting together in small —in large groups in close quarters . Those will be the\nharder parts of the economy to recover . But, ultimately , we do see a full recovery over time.\nAnd that ’s really what , you know, what I think I ’m—I’m personally seeing. And you could see\nsignificant job growth in —in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you’ re still going\nto face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work. A nd\nfor—and that ’s what you see in —in—in, really , many, many forecasts at this point. That doesn’ t\nmean it ’s right, but that’ s sort of a —a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris from the Associated Press.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you for taking our questions. Well, in the\nprojections you have —you didn’ t change the —the Fed policymakers didn’ t change their —the\nforecast for long- run unemployment, so that suggests that you —you know, the —that all of you\n\nso far don’ t see necessarily prospects for long -term damage. But still, what kind of data are you\nlooking at here to gauge , you know, the potential for longer -term hits to the economy even as we\nhave some of these—even as we have something like the May jobs report , you could still ha ve,\nat the same time, people return from temporary layoff s, there could still be permanent job losses?\nSo what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact , and what is —what is it\ntelling us so far?\nCHAIR POWELL. Chris, t his is a really important risk. And I think it ’s—it’ s not the\nrisk for the next few months, but it ’s the risk over time of —of lasting damage to the —to these —\nyou know, to the productive capacity of the United States , typically in two forms . One, through\nextended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force . They get out of\ntouch with the skills and —that they need, and— and they hav e a hard time getting back in, and\nthat drive s that—that , you know, it ’s very damaging to people ’s lives and their working lives .\nAnd it also just lowers , in a way —it can —it can increase the —you know, the unemployment\nrate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to\nhave people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the —in the labor force\nworking.\nThe other piece of it is just businesses. You know, a shock like this that just comes in,\nit’s like a natural disaster. You wouldn’ t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the\nsmaller and medium -sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to—\nyou know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that —like this where , really,\nthere was no reason for it. Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out . They’re\ngoing to fail all the time, and that ’s a healthy thing in capitalism . That’s something that has to\n\nhappen. B ut this is different . This is a way—potentially —so those are the things we ’ve been\nworried about.\nWe didn’ t change . You—you’ re right, though. We didn’ t change our longer -run\nestimate of —of potential growth or of the unemployment rate . And that ’s—I would say, in my\nthinking, the reason I didn’ t change mine is that I still— I—I think we can avoid that or avoid\nmuch of that, most of that even. A nd—and we do that with measures that —that , you know, keep\npeople in their homes ; that—that support hiring ; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary ,\navoidable business insolvencies. A nd that ’s all the things that we ’re trying to do. Basically, if\nyou look at what ’s happened, as I mentioned, there ’s something—somewhere short of 25 million\npeople have been displaced, even afte r the good May employment report. What we ’re trying to\ndo is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job\nor to get a new job. T hat’s—that ’s kind of the most important part of this exercise.\nAnd maybe these —it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that —that we won ’t have\nlonger -run damage to the economy, and these numbers won’ t change. So —but I think it’ s way\ntoo early to be —to be changing the longer run— see, these are—these are not meant to be short -\nrun numbers . They’re called —they’ re longer -run assessments, so I —I would —I have not\nchanged mine, and I ’m hopeful that —that I won ’t have to change it .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Heather Long.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I ’m struggling with two t hings\nthat I hope you can provide some clarity on. The first is the ongoing bond buying program . You\nsay that it ’s needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us are n’t\nreally seeing a lot of instability in markets right now. So if you could kind of give us some\nclarity of what you’ re seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace.\n\nSecond is, you know, you were just talking about Fed concerns about small and medium -sized\ncompanies going out of bus iness during this . And , I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending\nProgram still isn ’t running yet . When do you expect loans to start happening ? And do you think\nthe two -month delay has —has hurt the chances of some companies surviving?\nCHAIR POWELL. There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to\nwhere you would say they were, for example, in—in February, before the pandemic arrived. We\ndon’t take those gains for granted , though. This is a —this is a highly fluid situation , and we ’re—\nwe’re not taking those for granted. And, in addition, as I pointed out in my—in my statement,\nthose purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative —or accommodative financial\nconditions, and that ’s—that ’s a good thing, so that ’s why we ’re doing that.\nTurning quickly to Main S treet, s o I would say that t he thing —what we ’ve done on Main\nStreet, I think to a greater degree, is , we’ve listened to feedback. So we ’ve been out repeatedly\nfor feedback in trying to create a —a much more difficult pr oduct than, really , the other facilities.\nAnd I think this —this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the\nfacility. I think it ’s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we ’ve used the\ntime well, I think.\nAnd that —we are now in the —in the —in the run -up to starting the facility. What\nwe did, as you saw earlier —I guess it ’s early this week or late , whenever we did it in the last few\ndays—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximu m loan size. But , I\nthink, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly. So borrowers will get a —a two -year delay until they have to make any\nprincipal payments —repayments and a one -year dela y on interest. So we had been hearing from\n\nboth borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful. We made the changes. We’re\nputting them through the facility.\nThe next step will be to register lenders. At that time, loans can begin to be made.\nShortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be —those loans can be\nsold—95 percent of the loans . And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main S treet\nfacility can be sold. So all of that should happen quickly now. And I do think this has —this has\nbeen a challenging project, but I think we ’ve come to a—to a better place. And , by the way,\nwe’re—we ’re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to. A nd—and that ’s true of all of\nour facilities. These are uniqu e. There’s no— there ’s no playbook here. You—you have to draw\nthis up and then try it out. And we ’ve—we ’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will\ncontinue to be.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Matt from Bloomberg.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hello, Chai r Powell. This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg\nNews . I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance. There were some piecemeal\nforbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage\nmarket to prevent banks from forecl osing on such debts amid the widespread financial hardships\ncaused by the pandemic . And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and\nhouseholds still in dire financial straits, I ’m wondering if any consideration is being given at the\nFed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can ’t meet those payments. There have,\nof course , been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection P rogram on the fiscal side to address\nthis, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well. Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. We can—we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision.\nI don’ t know that we have the ability to make cha nges, for example, in mortgage payments, if\nthat’s what you’ re thinking of, or credit card payments . That’s really —that’s something that\ncould be legislative, or it could just be what the —what the banks themselves are doing. There ’s\nbeen a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there\nwould be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we —by the way, we have encouraged those decis ions. I hope that ’s responsive to your\nquestion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Scott Horsley, NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know you’ re loathe to weigh in too\nheavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it’s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level,\nand I ’ll—I’ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this : This is the biggest\neconomic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory. We went from the lowest\nlevel of employ—unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months . Extraordinary. And , appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has\nbeen large, forceful, and very quick by—by the standards of these things. Roughly $3 trillion\nCongress has authorized, and that ’s benefiting households ; laid-off workers ; small, medium, and\nlarge businesses; hospitals ; state and local gove rnments —14 percent of GDP . It is—it’ s in a\nclass by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it ’s also pretty innovative.\nYou know, the —both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in\nthe American context, and there w ere difficulties in implementing it, but that ’s really a function\n\nof—of their novelty, I think. Those programs —by the way, let me add: T he Fed also —we both\ninnovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well. If you put\nthose together, all of that is making a difference now. You look at the income data . The\nexpanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to\nreplacing lost income from —from job loss. I think you’ re seeing it in the job market data . Many\nare giving the PPP credit on that front and —and in keeping small businesses going. So it ’s—so\nfar, it’ s a good response , and it ’s having—it ’s having a big effect. You —you get to— the\nquestion is, it ’s big— everyone can see tha t it’s big. Is it going to be big enough? And that —that\nis the question . And—and the question for —for —the question that I ’ve been concerned about,\nreally, is this issue of longer -run damag e to the economy.\nWe’re—we’re —we ’re doing a fair job of getting through these first few months , more\nthan a fair job. The question, though, is, that group of people who won’ t be able to go back to\nwork quickly, what about them? And that could be many millions of people, you know , parts —\nwho worked in parts of the ec onomy that will be the slow ones to recover. And , you know, we\nwant those people back in the labor force . We want them getting jobs . So—and—and they’ re\ngoing to need possibly— probably will need further support. So I will just say this : It’s possible\nthat we will need to do more, and it ’s possible that Congress will need to do more.\nIn terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’ t try to give\nCongress advice on the specifics of that. I —I know they’ re looking at —I mean, I —I know from\nboth talking to people and—and reading the papers that they ’re looking at a whole bunch of\ndifferent possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising. So, you know, we ’re happy to give advice if people ask for it but —but probably not—not publicly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. David Gura.\n\nDAVID GURA. Thank you, Chair Powell. I ’m going to pick up on what Scott Horsley\nwas asking just a moment ago. You have been studious about threading this needle in the\ninterviews that you’ ve giv en and speeches and the—the colloquy that ’s followed, not giving\nadvice to Congress but indicating that there ’s likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or\nadditional policy in the future . So I’m going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it if—\nif you want.\nBut if you were to find yourself in a —in a senator ’s office suite, and he held up that May\nunemployment report, which you’ ve described as unexpectedly positive and —and a welcome\nsurprise, and if he or she said to you, “Look, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks, ”\nI wonder what you would say. Your —your message throughout this crisis has been one of how\nunprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this . Indeed, we ’ve seen\nthat from the Federal Reserve. I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn ’t being\nmatched and —and what the consequences of that might be, if there ’s a fear that the Fed could be\nseen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer,\nand you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in— in\nsubsequent reports.\nAnd a quick second question, if I could . You’ve talked a lot about your fear of a second\nwave of this disease, and it strikes me, there’ s a—a difficulty here with definition. You’ve\ntalked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm . It seems to me, as I listen\nto the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn’ t\nagreement on what “ getting through this ” means. A nd you have an A dministration now inclined\nto, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early. How\n\nproblematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have\ndefeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this ?\nCHAIR POWELL. I can’t offer any advice, b ut I will provide a little context for the —\nfor—I want to be clear about the picture —one way to look at the picture, really, and that is this :\nYou can—you can get at this by looking at , you know, the —the —the widest measure of\nunemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U -6 measure. And the U —that ’s the—\nthe one we look—talk about all the time is called U -3, by economists . And the —the one that has\na much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U -6. So in —in—in U -6, the U -6 level\nof unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent . That—that amounts to 22 million\nadditional people who are —who ’ve—who ’ve lost wor k in the economy either by going to part\ntime or something like that . So that ’s in the low 20s, and that ’s post the May employment report.\nYou can get at it a different way . You can look at —at just the regular unemployment\nrate. You can take the 21 [million] —people who have —ha d—are listed as unemployed right\nnow. You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded. Y ou can also take those people\nwho are suddenly out of the labor force . You put those together, a nd that has gone up by about\n24 million . So those are two different measures of what ’s happened. So the question is, 20, 22,\n24 million people —got to get them back to work. Somehow, we ’ve got to all, as a country, get\nthose people back to work. They didn’ t do anything wrong; this was a natural disaster, and I —I\nreally —I do think the response s so far have been great . So that ’s the way I would think about it.\nAnd if —if you think we —I would just , in terms of the May employment report, it ’s—it’ s\nso nice to see. I mean, I think what people were thinking was that you ’d start to get those back -\nto-work kind of numbers in June and July and August . Very few people saw them in May. I\nmean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid -May, but it did. And so, you know, and\n\nwe—we don’ t know fully what that means, whether it ’s just a timing change or whether it will\nprove to be much more than that . We’ll—we ’re going to have to wait and see. It is a —as I\nmentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and —and how humble we\nhave to be about our ability to— to really have confident predictions as opposed to just\npredictions.\nSo, bottom line, I would just say, that —that —the key thing people need to understand is\nthat there ’s just a lot of work to do in the labor ma rket. We’re going to stic k with this and\nsupport that until the work is done . That you—you can—that is something we ’re going to do\nwith all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well. It may, but that ’s going\nto be their decision.\nOn—you also asked about the second wave. So we—you know, we have major\nresponsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for\nelected officials at the state and local and federal level . And, you know, if they a sk, we —we\ndon’t have any pa rticular expertise here at the F ed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything\nlike that. We talk to experts, but —you know , so we don’ t have anything special to add on that. I\nwould just say, it ’s—you know, it ’s kind of self evident, I think, that if a —if it happens , you\nknow, the —the issue would be, first of all, people ’s health , but secondly, you could see a public\nloss of confidence in— in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover . So it could\nhurt the recovery even if you don’ t have a national -level pandemic, just a —just a series of —of\nlocal ones, of local spikes could —could have the effect of undermining people ’s confidence in\ntraveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in\nsmall groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt. So it would not be a positive development, and I ’ll just leave it at that.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question. On Main\nStreet l ending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55 —at least 55 companies file for\nbankruptcy. Do you think that it is too late , first of all? Second of all, the future of these\nfacilities —is this a one -year impact to the economy through these facilities, or is this a\nmultiple -year? If so, how many years?\nCHAIR POWELL. We have , you know, significant interest, we think. And also,\nremember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too. The —the banks are lendi ng.\nThe markets are open . You know, you have a —a—a much better lending climate than —than\ncertainly than we had in February and March. W e don’ t think it’ s too late, though. We —we —\nand we do expect it to be up quite soon.\nIn terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we ’ll leave them open as —we ’ll\nleave them open for new loans as long as they need to. T hat’ll be a decision we make, of course,\nwith our colleagues at the Treasury Department . And, at a certain point, there won ’t be a need\nfor furth er loans, and— and then the assets will —will be there. And so if that ’s—I don’ t know if\nthat’s a part of your question too, but I would just say that , at that point , you know, the —the\nuseful role of the —of the Federal Reserve is probably close t o an end at that point.\nWe don’ t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans —if you will —or\nbonds, and we , you know, we don’ t want to be made —we don’ t really want to be part of the\ndecisions th at have to be made to manage such a portfolio, so we ’d be looking to have that done\neither someplace else or , you know, by—by a third party or at the Treasury Department or\nsomething. And we ’re, you know, we ’re working on ideas for that. But our real focus now is\n\non—is getting these facilities going and —and ge tting them to do the job that they— they need\nto do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jonelle with Reuters.\nJONELLE MARTE. Thank you, Chair. So I have two quick questions. One is if we\nhave hit bottom for the economy, and the second question is regarding the —the way that the\npandemic has exacerbated racial inequality. I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can\nfactor in both disparities when you’ re thinking a bout maximum employment ?\nCHAIR POWELL. I would say that many forecasters had been expectin g a bottom for\nthe economy in—around the middle of the year, with—with a huge range of uncertainty. I think\nthe labor market— the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in\nMay. We don ’t know that ; we’re going to see. And , you know, many forecasters widely expect\na—a recovery over the second half of the year . So it—it is possible, but the thing is, we ’re not\ngoing to overreact to a single data point. We ’re going to be very careful about reaching any\nconclusions about —about good data or bad data . So, I think , you know, we ’re going to be here\nwith our tools supporting this economy for as long as it ’s needed. So —but I think there ’s a\npossibility that —that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don’ t know that yet.\nWe’ll—we ’ll know more as we go forward.\nSo, in terms of the —you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see —\nthe pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they’ re—it’ s the travel,\nleisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service -economy jobs. And so a lot of the lost jobs were\nfrom people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively —compared to other jobs, relatively low wages. So, and if —if you just look at what\n\nthat is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans . And\nwomen have borne —borne an extraordinary— a notable share of the burden beyond their\npercentage in the workforce.\nSo that ’s really —really, really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months,\nwhere we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter -century. A nd\nfor the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for\npeople at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great. And , you know, we were\nmeeting with people from low - and—low - and moderate -income communities all over the\ncountry and hearing, “D on’t change this . Do whatever you—do whatever you can. Keep this\ngoing. T his is the best labor market we ’ve seen. ” And we had every expect —every expectation,\nevery reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes. So it ’s—it’s heartbreaking,\nand, you know, we want to get it back, so—we really want to get it back.\nAnd so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years . One\nof them is that , you know, I —you—you can have 3, 3½ percent unemployment for a couple of\nyears, and , really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in\ninflation. So that was not anybody’ s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or\nmost peoples ’, anyway.\nSo we can use our tools to —to support the labor market and support the economy. We\ncan—we can use them until we do fully recover, and that —that’s what we ’re planning to do.\nYou know, we don’ t target different groups . What—what we are—we are cognizant of t he fact ,\nthough, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for —for the first time in many years when labor\n\nmarkets are tight, when unemployment is low . And so we would really like to get back to that —\nget back to that place.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria from Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted to follow up on\na couple of things that are —have already been asked. First of all, on fiscal policy, you all\nobviously put out your Summary of E conomic P rojections today , and I ’m curious to what extent\nfuture fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and—and how, more or\nless, fiscal policy might affect those projections . And then my other question is on —on Main\nStreet. Y ou’ve mentioned multiple times that , you know, the Fed and T reasury are willing to\nexpand the program further. So my question is, what ’s the threshold for those types of changes?\nIs it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are —are —are able\nto do that?\nCHAIR POWELL. In terms of the way—the way we do forecasts is, we —we don’ t—\nthe—we don’ t tend to incorporate things we ’re highly uncertain about. So I thin k the —the\nforecast would not have included substantial additional —you know, big additional fiscal support\nfor the economy. M aybe —maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a —a low -end\nguess on what might come out of the current negotiations . That’s basically what would be in the\nbaseline. So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you’ d see—you’ d see better results\nsooner, but that ’s a question for Congress. You know, we ’re—we ’re spending a lot , and that ’s\nreally what they get to decide.\nIn terms of Main S treet and our willingness to expand it further, I think we ’re—one thing\nwe’re looking at —very strongly looking at is —is nonprofits, and is there a way to—to\nincorporate them into—into that facility or a similar facility . So that ’s another dimension. I —\n\nyou know, if we had a great idea for changing Main S treet, we would’ ve done it . And we —and\nwe have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here. But if we —as we\nlearn more, it could be —it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different\nthings. But I —I think we have a good product to go to market with now , and I think it ’ll get —\nit’ll get out there soon. A nd, you know, we ’ll see, and —and we ’ll be willing to continue\nto adapt.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee.\nDON LEE. Chair Powell , as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid\noff are expecting to be recalled by their employers. At this point, what is your expectation of\nhow much of these job losses will be permanent?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t have a reliable estimate o f that. Clearly, not everyone will go\nback. But —and I —I would say, many will go back, but what ’s—what ’s going to be the\nremainder when —you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal? It’s—it’s so\nuncer tain, but it —it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many —in many\nestimates, b ut these —I’d say you’ re so early in the process. People are —for example, people are\ngoing back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they’ ve seen how many\npeople go back when, for example, there ’s a technological change, and things like that —you\nmay have seen some of this research —and you come up with an estimate . I—you know, it ’s just\ngoing to be very hard to say.\nI—I, but I —my—my ass umption is that there will be a significant chunk —chunk well\ninto the millions. I—I don ’t want to give you a number , because it ’s going to be a guess , but\nwell, well into the millions of people who —who don’ t get to go back to their old job. And, in\nfact, there isn ’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time. There will\n\neventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs. I\nmean, when—when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that ’s usually\nthe fastest way, is—is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs . That’s\nusually the fastest. If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it ’s much\nharder, and that ’s where you start to lose people ’s—who are —just fall out of the labor force.\nAnd—and, you know, it ’s very tough on their lives. We all know people who—to whom that\nhappened in the Global F inancial C risis, and, hence, our desire to—to do what we can to support\nthis and— and—an d support this recovery with— with the tools that we have.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall -Genzer.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer, Marketplace. Chair Powell,\nI’m wondering—I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I’m won dering, what more\ncould the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country? I mean, I know that you said\nyou don’ t target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black\nunemployment rate as —as some kind of a benchmark to something you ’d want to meet or\nsomething that you’d keep track of?\nCHAIR POWELL. We do. We do t rack all unemployment by all kinds, as you know —\nall kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African American unemployment\nrate, which reached an all -time low since the data started being kept in the modern era. Of\ncourse, it ’s still close to twice the white unemployment —it is twice the unemployment rate, or it\nwas back in the —back then. It’s certainly much higher now.\nYou know, the —the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look\nat, you know, the evidence of what we saw —that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which\nis that the economy can have very low unemployment —very low unemployment . It could’ ve\n\nbeen low er than we were. I t could be lower than 3½ percent without seeing financial\nimbalances, without seeing inflation going—getting out of control. We, frankly, didn ’t even get\ninflation back up to target —without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with wh ere they\nshould be, so that ’s the—that ’s the biggest thing we can do.\nYou know, in—in —inequality is something that ’s been with us increasingly for more\nthan four decades , and it ’s—it’s not really related to monetary policy . It’s, or—or it ’s more\nrelated to —there are a lot of theories on —on what causes it, but it ’s been something that ’s more\nor less been going up consistently for more than four decades . And there are a lot of different\ntheories, one of which is —just is that it—globalization —globalization and technology call for\nrising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that U.S. educational attainment kind of\nflattened out, certainly relative to our peers —flattened out over that period.\nAnd so a lot —so that means if you’ re—if you’ re on the r ight side of those trends, then\nthose things are good for you. If you’ re not, then your wages are going to stagnate . And wages\nfor the bottom , you know, 10 percent really haven ’t gone up in real terms in a very long time ,\nand—over a long period of time, whereas wages for the people at the top , compensation, any\nway you cut it —before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it —wages\nhave —compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn’ t gone up\nfor people at the bottom. If you look more in the middle, then it ’s—then—then it has gone up\nfor most other groups , but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in inflation -adjusted terms.\nSo, you know, we —we call it out as a—as an important factor in the e conomy, and we\nwill use our tools to support maximum employment and take that , you know, definition to heart.\nBut, obviously, that ’s something that ’s going to require an all -of-society, all -of-government\nresponse.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we’ll go to Michael McKee with\nBloomberg TV .\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio.\nI came across a statistic the other day that amazed me. Since your March 23 emergency\nannouncement, every single stock in the S &P 500 has delivered a positive return. And I’m\nwondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is\na possible bubble blowing that could pop and set back the recovery significantly, or that we\nmight see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over .\nSecond, inequality is not just about wages, it ’s also about wealth. A nd a number of\nstudies have suggested that by keep ing rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the\ngreat financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country. And I ’m\nwondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would\naffect that.\nCHAIR POWELL. What we ’ve targeted is broader financial conditions. If you go back\nto the end of February and early March, you had—basically , the world markets realized at just\nabout the same time —I remember that Monday —that there was going to be a global pandemic ,\nand that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen. It all—it was —you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then\nit became clear in markets. From that point forw ard, investors everywhere in the world, for a\nperiod of weeks , wanted to sell everything that wasn ’t cash or a —a short -term Treasury\ninstrument. They didn’ t want it to have any risk at all. And so what happened is , markets\nstopped working. They stopped working, and companies couldn’ t—couldn’ t borrow . They\ncouldn’ t roll over their debt. People couldn’ t borrow. So that ’s—that ’s the kind of situation that\n\ncan be very—financial turbulence and malfunction—a financial system that ’s not working can\ngreatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock.\nSo what our tools were —were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function.\nAnd I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I —as I ment ioned in my opening\nremarks, and that ’s a good thing. So we —we ’re not looking to achieve a particular level of any\nasset price. What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do.\nBorrowers are borrowing . Lenders are lendin g. We want the markets to be working. And ,\nagain, we ’re not looking to—to a particular level.\nI think our —our principal focus , though, is on —on the state of the economy and on the\nlabor market and on inflation. Now, inflation, of course, is —is low, and we think it ’s very likely\nto remain low for some time , below our target. So, really, it ’s about getting the labor market\nback and getting it in shape . That’s—that ’s been our major focus. And I would say, you know,\nwe—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but —the idea that, just the\nconcept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high —others may not\nthink so, but we just decided that that ’s the case —what would happen to those people? You\nknow, what woul d happen to the people that we ’re actually legally supposed to be serving?\nWe’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that ’s what we ’re\npursuing.\nWe’re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system tha t is so\nmuch better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks,\nmore highly liquid. You have all of those things . And they’ ve been lending. T hey’ve been\ntaking in deposits . They’ve been a source of strength in this situation.\n\nSo I would say that , you know, we ’re tightly focused on our real economy goals. And —\nand, again, not —we ’re not —we ’re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at\nall. It’s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we’ ve done,\nthey—they are working. A nd, you know, we hope that continues. Thank you very much."
