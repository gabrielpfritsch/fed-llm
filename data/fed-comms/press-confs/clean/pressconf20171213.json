  "text": "CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decide d\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ perce ntage point, bringing it to 1¼ to\n1½ percent. Our decision reflect s our assessment that a gradua l removal of monetary policy\naccommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fosterin g a return of inflation to\n2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price sta bility objectives assigned to us\nby law. Before saying more about our decision, I’ll review rec ent economic developments and\nthe outlook.\nFollowing a slowdown in the first qu arter, economic growth step ped up to a solid\n3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year. Household spending has been\nexpanding at a moderate rate, bus iness investment has picked up , and favorable economic\nconditions abroad have supported e xports. Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will\nexpand at a moderate pace. While changes in tax policy will li kely provide some lift to\neconomic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of\nany tax package remain uncertain.\nSmoothing through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains ave raged 170,000 per month\nover the three months ending in N ovember, well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb\nnew entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate has dec lined further in recent months\nand, at 4.1 percent in November, w as modestly below the median of FOMC participants’\nestimates of its longer-run normal level. Broader measures of labor market utilization have also\ncontinued to strengthen. Parti cipation in the labor force has changed little, on net, over the past\nfour years. Given the underlyi ng downward tren d in participati on stemming largely from the\naging of the U.S. population, a rel atively steady participation rate is a further sign of improved\n\nconditions in the labor market. We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years\nahead.\nYou may have noticed that we alter ed the statement language abo ut the labor market\noutlook. This change highlights th at the Committee expects the labor market to remain strong,\nwith sustained job creation, amp le opportunities for workers, a nd rising wages. We anticipate\nsome further strengthening in labor market conditions in the mo nths ahead; however, we expect\nthe pace of job gains to moderate over time as we gradually red uce the degree of monetary\npolicy accommodation. Allowing the l abor market to overheat wo uld raise the risk that\nmonetary policy would need to tight en abruptly at a later stage , jeopardizing the economic\nexpansion.\nEven with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor mar ket, inflation has\ncontinued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objectiv e. The 12-month change in the\nprice index for personal consum ption expenditures was 1.6 perce nt in October, up a bit from the\nsummer but still below rates se en earlier in the year. Core in flation—which excludes the volatile\nfood and energy categories—has fo llowed a similar pattern and w as 1.4 percent in October. We\ncontinue to believe that this ye ar’s surprising softness in inf lation primarily refle cts transitory\ndevelopments that are largel y unrelated to broader economic con ditions. As a result, we still\nexpect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent ov er the next couple of years.\nNonetheless, as I’ve noted pr eviously, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is\nimperfect. As emphasized in our sta tement, we will carefully m onitor actual and expected\ninflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal . And, as I’ve noted before, we\nare prepared to adjust monetar y policy as needed to achieve our inflation and employment\nobjectives over the medium term.\n\nLet me turn to the economic proj ections that Committee particip ants submitted for this\nmeeting. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of\nappropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each par ticipant’s assessment of the\nmany factors that shape the out look. The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted\ngross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2½ percent this year an d next and moderates to 2 percent\nby 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate. The median projection for the unemployment\nrate stands at 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year a nd runs close to 4 percent over the\nnext three years, modestly below the median estimate of its lon ger-run normal rate. Finally, the\nmedian inflation projection i s 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 perce nt next year, and 2 percent in 2019\nand 2020. Compared with the projections made in September, rea l GDP growth is a little\nstronger, the unemployment rate i s a bit lower, a nd inflation i s essentially unchanged.\nParticipants generally identif ied changes in tax policy as a fa ctor supporting this modestly\nstronger outlook, although many note d that much uncertainty rem ains about the macroeconomic\neffects of the specific measures that ultimately may be impleme nted.\nReturning to monetar y policy, for the past two years the FOMC h as been gradually\nincreasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the e conomy has continued to make\nprogress toward our goals of maxim um employment and price stabi lity. Our decision today\ncontinues this process.\nWe still expect that the ongoing s trength of the economy will w arrant gradual increases in\nthe federal funds rate. That expectation is based on our view that this rate remains somewhat\nbelow its neutral level—that is , the level that is neither expa nsionary nor contractionary and\nkeeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutr al rate currently appears to be\nquite low by historical standards , the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to\n\nget to a neutral policy stance. But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds\nrate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the\nnext few years to sustain a str ong labor market and stabilize i nflation around our 2 percent\nlonger-run objective. Even so, the Committee continues to anti cipate that the longer-run neutral\nlevel of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below level s that prevailed in previous decades.\nThis view is consistent with par ticipants’ projections of appro priate monetary policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of ne xt year, 2.7 percent\nat the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020. Compared with the projections made in September,\nthe median path for the feder al funds rate is unchanged through 2019 and a touch higher in 2020.\nI should note that the economic outlook is highly uncertain, an d participants will adjust\ntheir assessments of the appropr iate path for the federal funds rate as their economic outlooks\nand views of the risks to the outlook change. Policy is not on a preset course.\nAdditionally, the Committee’s ba lance sheet norm alization progr am, initiated in October,\nis proceeding. As we’ve noted pr eviously, changing the target range for the feder al funds rate is\nour primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, a nd we do not foresee a need to\nalter our balance sheet norma lization program. Hence, our stat ement no longer mentions this\nprogram. Of course, we would be pr epared to resume reinvestmen ts if a material deterioration in\nthe economic outlook were to warra nt a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.\nFinally, I’d like to note that , although I have one more FOMC m eeting to attend in the\nNew Year, this will be my last scheduled news conference. Over the next month and a half, I\nwill do my utmost to ensure a sm ooth transition to my designate d successor, Jay Powell. I am\nconfident that he is as deeply committed as I have been to the Federal Reserve’s vital public\n\nmission. Thank you for being such an a ttentive audi ence these past four years. And, as always,\nI’ll be happy to take your questions.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. I’m Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press. Ma dam Chair,\ncould you give us any insight int o the discussion and how it de alt with the major tax changes that\nCongress is considering now? T here have been thoughts that wit h these changes happening at a\ntime when the economy is already—with unemployment so low—that the Fed may be forced to\nincrease its pace on rate hikes . Did any of that discussion co me up in your meeting?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, yes, we did di scuss tax policy, and let me s ay that most of my\ncolleagues factored in the prospe ct of fiscal stimulus along th e lines of what’s being\ncontemplated by Congress into the ir projections. Now, I should emphasize that some have been\nincorporating those expectations into their projections through out the year, so changes to the\nprojections that you see since Se ptember should not be viewed a s an impact—an estimate of the\nimpact of the tax package. And, i n particular, broader expecta tions of changes to fiscal policy\nhave been reflected in financi al market conditions, I think, ov er the past year. For example, we\nhave seen a significant increase in the stock market, and at le ast some portion of that, I would\njudge, likely partly reflected e xpected tax changes, and that e ffect—along with other financial\nmarket effects, which affects, f or example, projected consumer spending and would have\naffected wealth—that’s been part of participants’ forecasts now for some time. I think my\ncolleagues and I are in line wit h the general expectation among most economists that the type of\ntax changes that are likely t o be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth\nin the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of th e reasons, I think, for the uptick\nyou see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rat e.\n\nThe views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a w ide range of analysis,\nincluding that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other out side evaluators, and my sense is\nthat their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, alth ough they recognize, as I\nemphasized, that there is consid erable uncertainty about the im pacts, and that will have to be\nmonitored over time. More spec ifically, they t end to see the p ackage as boosting both consumer\nspending and capital spending, to some extent.\nNow, to the extent that the c hanges do have positive impact on the growth of potential\nGDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is somethi ng that, should it occur, would be\nvery welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with t he attainment of our employment\nand inflation objectives. I gue ss I would also urge you to rem ember that when you look at the\nprojections, that there are ma ny factors that affect those proj ections, and changes in tax policy—\nthat’s only one of a number of f actors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered\nthe outlook for growth and infla tion. All of tha t factors into the projections you see.\nBut I think, bottom line, whe n you look at assessments of the f unds rate path, participants\ncontinue to see gradual increases in the target r ange for the f ederal funds rate as being\nappropriate to sustain a strong l abor market and bring inflatio n back to 2 percent. And, look—\nimportantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likel y effects will be, and my colleagues\nand I will be committed, as alwa ys, to evaluating incoming data and altering the outlook as\nappropriate.\nHARRIET TORRY. Harriet Torry with Dow Jones Newswires. You an d others at the\nFed have said that soft infla tion should be transitory. Are yo u confident that tha t will still be the\ncase, particularly regarding wag e gains? They’ve been pretty m oderate in recent months, yet the\n\neconomy is growing and confiden ce is high. Is there something going on in the economy that’s\nmaking it difficult for businesses to raise wages?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So it is true that i ncoming wage data suggests o nly modest upward\npressure on wages. That leaves me—that’s one factor, along wit h the fact that inflation remains\nlow—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemplo yment rate, that the labor\nmarket is not overheated at thi s point. Remember, the modest p ace of wage gains also probably\nreflects slow productivity growth. But when you ask me about t he outlook for inflation, you\nknow, I’ve talked in detail abou t this in the past and recogniz e that there is uncertainty about\nwhat’s holding inflation down. But my colleagues and I continu e to believe that th e factors that\nare responsible this year for hol ding inflation down are likely to prove transitory. That said, we\nall agree that our inf lation objective is extremely important. We recognize that there’s been a\nprolonged shortfall. This is a s ymmetric 2 percent inflation o bjective, and we continue to\nindicate that we’ll be monitori ng inflation developments closel y. And so this is on the horizon\nand recognized to be one of the risks facing policy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Yellen, I\nwanted to follow up on the questi on about tax changes. When yo u addressed it earlier today, and\nwhen you spoke to Congress last month, you often describe that you would welcome higher\ngrowth in the context of the emp loyment and inflation mandate. And I guess I wonder how you\njudge the major provisions of t he House and Senate tax plans: the corporate rate cut, immediate\nexpensing of big-ticket purchases , new rates for pass-throughs, temporary rate cuts for\nindividuals. Do you see thos e, on balance, boosting the produc tive capacity of the U.S. economy\nas opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand? And, related to that, how would you view\n\nthe benefit of such tax changes now, when the economy is nearin g full employment, versus at\nearlier periods when there was greater resource slack?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the li kely tax package as\nboosting aggregate demand, but als o having some potential to bo ost aggregate supply. So\nchanges on the corporate tax sid e—the reduction in the corporat e tax rate, expensing—will lower\nthe cost of capital. And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much\nstimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would se e some stimulus to investment.\nIn terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of invest ment could boost capital\nformation and thereby raise produ ctivity growth and potential G DP or output to some extent.\nExactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel. And I suppose\nit’s also possible—I’m uncertain ho w significant this would be— that lower marginal effective\ntax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor supply. And, again, there are a\nrange of estimates in the literatures.\nI indicated I think participants have reviewed a number of piec es of analysis, including\nthe Joint Committee on Taxati on estimates, and the many outside analysts who have weighed in\non this and been influenced by tha t kind of analysis—but there is a good deal of uncertainty\nabout what the impacts would be. And, to the extent that there are larger impacts than those\nanalyses assume on aggregate s upply or potential GDP, in the co ntext of an economy that has\nhad disturbingly low productivit y growth, that would be welcome and could support faster GDP\ngrowth, at least for some period, without—you know, without cre ating a need to tighten\nmonetary policy to offset that.\nSo there are potentially bot h demand and supply effects here. So, importantly, you really\ndon’t, at the end of the day, see very much change in the feder al funds rate path. Participants do\n\nrecognize that the unemployment ra te is lower than their estima tes of its long-run sustainable\nrate, so I think we ar e in the vicinity of full employment.\nHEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. You have mentioned that\nthe Committee thinks there will be wage increases next year. I ’m wondering if you could clarify\nif that is coming in part or mostl y from the changes to the tax plan. Is that what the expectation\nis, would drive the wage increas es? And I was also wondering, I’ve heard from so many female\neconomists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration you’ve been to them and how\nmelancholy they will be to s ee you go. I was wondering if you just had any words to young\nfemales and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or a banking profession and rise\nto your level.\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’m sorry, remind me of the first part of your q uestion. [Laughter]\nHEATHER LONG. Wages. CHAIR YELLEN. Wages, yes.\nHEATHER LONG. Is the tax policy dr iving wage increase expectat ions?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think, gene rally, in a strong labor mark et where many firms\nare having difficulty finding quali fied workers, we would expec t, just through normal demand\nand supply channels, to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time. And as the labor\nmarket is tightened, we’ve seen s ome very gradual drift upward in wage gains. They remain—it\nremains at a low level, but I w ould expect, in the context of a n ongoing strong labor market, to\nsee some upward pressure. And I be lieve that’s the main thing that my colleagues are\nfactoring in.\nOn your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Fede ral Reserve, my\ncolleagues and I are very fo cused on wanting to see and do what we can to foster greater\n\nparticipation of women and minor ities in economics. We would l ove to, if we could, increase\nour hiring ourselves of women and minorities, and we see that b oth women and minorities are\nstudying economics in disproportiona tely and disturbingly low n umbers. Although the women\nin STEM fields generally are abou t even with men—represent abou t 50 percent—in economics,\nwomen majors constitute somet hing like 30 percent of undergradu ate majors, and there is\ndisproportionate low enrollment of minorities.\nI will just say, from my own experience, I think economics is a terrific field. I’ve\nthoroughly enjoyed my career in economics and think there are m any different paths that people\ncan follow that lead to satisfyi ng careers, and that there are very interesting and important\nquestions that economics addresse s. And it is a great field, a nd I would like to encourage greater\ninvolvement and think that peopl e will find that satisfying. A nd, just in terms of the kinds of\nresearch that’s done in the fi eld, I think also a greater diver sity, more women and minorities,\nmay change the focus to some ext ent of the questions that peopl e choose to look at and the\nanalysis that they bring and a r ange of thinking that bears on research. And all of that would be a\nhealthy development.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, C NBC. Every day, it seems, we l ook at the stock\nmarket, it goes up triple digits in the Dow Jones. To what ext ent are there concerns at the\nFederal Reserve about current market valuations, and do they no w or should they, do you think,\nif we keep going on this trajectory— should that animate monetar y policy? Finally, maybe as a\nsign of what’s been going on with va luations, this cryptocurren cy called bitcoin keeps going up\nevery day. What is the policy of t he central bank of the Unite d States of the introduction, use,\nand incredible rise i n popularity of bitcoin?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Okay. So let me star t, Steve, with the stock ma rket generally. I\nmean, of course the stock mar ket has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent\nmonths characterized the general level of asset valuations as “ elevated.” What that reflects is\nsimply the assessment that, looki ng at price/earnings ratios an d comparable metrics for other\nassets other than equities, we s ee ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’s\nworth pointing out. But economists are not great at knowing wh at appropriate valuations are.\nWe don’t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuat ions are high doesn’t mean that they\nare necessarily overvalued.\nWe are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we ’ve talked about this\nrepeatedly—likely a low interes t rate environment, lower than w e’ve had in past decades. And if\nthat turns out to be the case, t hat’s a factor that supports hi gher valuations. We’re enjoying solid\neconomic growth with low inflati on, and the risks in the global economy look more balanced\nthan they have in many years . So I think what we need to and a re trying to think through is, if\nthere were an adjustment in ass et valuations or the stock marke t, what impact would that have on\nthe economy, and would it provoke fi nancial stability concerns? And I think when we look at\nother indicators of financial s tability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there or possibly even\norange. We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system , and we’re not seeing some\nworrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive le vels.1 So, you know, this is\nsomething that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, i s this a significant factor shaping\nmonetary policy now, we ll, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor.\nAnd then you asked about bitcoin, a nd there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time\nplays a very small role in the payment system. It is not a sta ble source of—store of value, and it\n\n1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive levels.\n\ndoesn’t constitute legal tender. It is a highly speculative as set, and the Fed doesn’t really play\nany role—any regulatory role wi th respect to bitcoin other than assuring that banking\norganizations that we do supervis e are attentive, that they’re appropriately managing any\ninteractions they have with partic ipants in that market and app ropriately monitoring anti-money-\nlaundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, r esponsibilities that th ey have.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Has there been a directive, or, more importantl y, has there been a\ndirective about bitcoin to the ba nks and their dealings with bi tcoin from the Federal Reserve?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I don’t believe the re’s been anything specific a bout that, just,\ngenerally, banks have Bank Secrecy Act anti-money-laundering re sponsibilities, and this applies\nto bitcoin as it does i n every other realm.\nDONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair Yelle n, Donna Borak with CNN. To retur n back to the\nprospective tax bill questions, in y our view at all, is the Rep ublican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal\nstimulus, and are you concerned at all it will wind up squander ing the tools both the Congress\nand the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, look, I will just say that it is up to the A dministration and\nCongress to decide on appropr iate fiscal policy, and our job is to maintain our focus on\nemployment and inflation. We c ontinue to think, as you can see from the projections, that a\ngradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with al most all participants now\nfactoring in their assessment of the impact of the tax—the tax policy.\nYou know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to additions to the national\ndebt and boost, by the end of the hor izon, the debt-to-GDP rati o. And I will say—and this is\nnothing new, this is something I’v e been saying for a long time —I am personally concerned\nabout the U.S. debt situation. It’ s not that the debt-to-GDP r atio at the moment is extraordinarily\n\nor worrisomely high, but it’s als o not very low. And it’s proj ected, as the population continues\nto age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will contin ue to rise in an unsustainable\nfashion. So the addition to the debt, taking what is already a significant problem and making it\nworse, is—it is of concern to me , and I think it does suggest t hat in some future downturn,\nwhich, well, could occur just for whatever reason, the amount o f fiscal space that would exist for\nfiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited—may we ll be limited.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . A couple of longer-term\nquestions. First of all, midwa y through the year you talked ab out the issue of whether inflation\ntargets might need to be raise d. There’s obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed’s system\nsince then about this. It ma y not be an imminent issue, but do you expect it to be something the\nFed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?\nSecond of all, the amount of stimul us tools that the Fed may ha ve at its disposal when the next\ndownturn strikes are fairly limited. One of the incoming gover nors, Marvin Goodfriend, has\ntalked about the merits of negativ e interest rates. I just won dered whether you see that as a\npotential—or at least in theory, f or the Fed to consider should it run out of other options.\nThanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So right now the F OMC is not discussing or consi dering its inflation\ntarget. We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years, and I\nwould say—you said our stimulus too ls are limited. I would wan t to emphasize that if there were\na negative shock to the econom y, we do have some scope to cut t he fed funds rate, and there are\nother tools available, ones that we have used previously: forw ard guidance and asset purchases.\nSo I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunitio n, but certainly it’s been\nrecognized—and I’ve emphasized mys elf that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have to\n\nsee how this works out, but we ma y be in low interest rate envi ronments where it could prove\nuseful to have additional scope to conduct monetary policy. An d, in that context, I think\nadditional research—the academic economists and others are thin king hard about what more\ncould be done, and I think these are matters that are certainly worthy of further study.\nSAM FLEMING. So you do believe tha t negative interest rates, a t least in theory, are\npossible in the U.S. at some point if it should be necessary—at least in theory.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I mean, on that I would say we have—that’s n ot something that\nwe have studied inside the Fed t o any considerable extent and h aven’t seriously thought about\nusing ourselves during this las t downturn and recovery. We hav e watched what’s happened in\nother countries. I think that ’s worthwhile. And I would say i t’s an area that academics may have\ninterest in in the future and i s worthy of some study, but it h asn’t been part of the Fed’s agenda.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, C hair Yellen. Victoria Guida with Politic o. I just wanted to\nask you quickly, on the regulator y side, in your testimony to C ongress recently you spoke\npositively about the Senate bank re gulatory reform bill, and I was wondering if there are—\nbeyond that bill—if there are tweaks to Dodd-Frank that you thi nk might still be beneficial. And\nthen, somewhat related, Governor Powell recently said that ther e are currently no U.S. banks that\nare too big to fail. And I w as wondering, do you agree with th at assessment?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mea n, you know, I think I’m not familiar with every detail of\nthe bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of iss ues that, you know, we’ve highlighted\nin the past as being ones where pe rhaps additiona l flexibility to tailor our supervisory\nrequirements would be worthwhile. So I don’t have additional t hings on the congressional list.\nSorry, and what—the other thing—\nVICTORIA GUIDA. T oo big to fail.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Oh, too big to fail.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Are there any banks that are too big to fail r ight now?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, we con tinue to work seriously on r esolution and the\nresolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of system ic firms to ensure that it would be\npossible to resolve a firm—unde r the bankruptcy code would be t he top choice of methods, or,\nalternatively, under the Orde rly Liquidation Authority. And I think it’s fair to say that, over\ntime, we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firms\nthat file living wills. And the firms themselves have made con siderable progress in, you know,\nchanging what they do, whether it ’s adopting financial contract s that would facilitate a resolution\nrather than a disorderly unwi nding of contracts, making sure th at they’re appropr iately dealing\nwith shared services so that ke y services would be able to cont inue, governance arrangements,\nlegal entity structures—the fi rms have all made progress in ada pting to our expectations of what\nwould enable a successful res olution. So I think it’s an ongoi ng process, and I believe we have\nmade substantial progress.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . I’m struggling to\nreconcile the pieces of the economic outlook that you’ve descri bed today. You’ve said that we\nare basically at full employme nt. You’ve said that you’re expe cting a tax package to deliver a\nsignificant stimulus, and that it will be on the demand side. You expect growth to be faster. You\nexpect unemployment to be lower , and yet somehow inflation is g oing to remain at 2 percent for\nthe foreseeable future. Coul d you describe what has changed ab out your economic assessment\nso that everything has cha nged except inflation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, you know, the proj ections that we’re showi ng you today, many\nfactors went into that, fis cal policy being one of a number of different factors. And, you know,\n\nyou’re looking at 16 participants w ho have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a\nwhole variety of reasons, includ ing, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals that\nwent into their original forecast. So there have been modifica tions in different directions by\ndifferent participants. So I would caution you about the dang ers of looking at the median and\nacting like that is on e individual who has made a change to the ir forecast. That’s a leap that isn’t\nquite justified.\nBut, look, generally, you see modes tly faster growth over the n ext couple of years, which\nis consistent and, I said, I thi nk for most participants, refle cts partly an impact from taxes\nstimulating consumer and investment spending. But it’s not a g igantic increase in growth that\nsince—relative to September.\nYou do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inf lation has also been\nrunning low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and\nwants to see it moving up. And, on balance, you see only modes t changes, slight revisions to the\npath for the fed funds rate . You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more? Well, okay, growth is a\nlittle stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower— that would perhaps push in the\ndirection of slightly tighter monetary policy. But, again, cou nterbalancing that is that inflation\nhas run lower than we expect , and, you know, it could take a lo nger period of a very strong labor\nmarket in order to achieve the inflation objective.\nJUSTINE UNDERHILL. Justine Un derhill, Yahoo Finance. So Willi am Dudley of the\nNew York Fed recently said that th e Fed is exploring the idea o f potentially having its own\ncryptocurrency or digital cu rrency. What use do you see a cryp tocurrency could have for the\nFed, and do you see the potential of a cryptocurrency that migh t be considered legal tender?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I want to disti nguish carefully between digit al currency and\ncryptocurrency. This is—there is a discussion going on among c entral bankers about the\npotential merits of adopting—a central bank itself adopting a d igital currency. And there might\neven be a central banker or tw o around the globe that might go in that direction. But I really\nwant to caution that this is not s omething the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this\nstage while we’re looking at re search on this to pic. There are , I think, to my mind, limited\nbenefits from introducing it, a limited need for it, and some s ubstantial concerns. And so I would\nreally doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that dir ection. But it is something that\ncentral banks are looking at to s ee if there could be benefits from doing it.\nCRAIG TORRES. Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks for your stewardship\nof the economy, the benefits of w hich I’ve seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my own\nfamily, so—\nCHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.\nCRAIG TORRES. Your tenure. We’ ve seen six Federal Reserve pre sidents appointed.\nOne was a woman and five are m en, so I’d like to know how that comports with your\ncommitment to gender diversity. And, second, I wonder if you t hink this process of appointing\nReserve Bank presidents needs t o be more transparent and accoun table. Recently, the Richmond\nFed board took 11 months, and they c ame up with a candidate who was another Fed board\nmember. And so I’m wondering wha t you would say to critics who say that looks like cronyism,\nand if you think, you know, this coul d be simply a more open pr ocess. These are votes on\nnational monetary policy, after all.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would agree w ith you that these are importa nt appointments.\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act , the nonbanking directors of the Reserve Banks have\n\nresponsibility for conducting a s earch, and the Board of Govern ors has to sign off on the\ncandidates. We’ve made very c lear and we monitor ongoing searc hes very carefully to make\nsure that absolutely every effo rt is made to create a pool that is diverse, and t hat there be a\nnational search, and that every a ttempt should be made to creat e a diverse pool. At the end of the\nday, we cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these searches wi ll result in an increase in\ndiversity. I mean, I’ve been ver y pleased to see that there’s been some success in that regard, but\nwe have signed off on the indivi duals who were appointed and ha ve held the view that these are\nindividuals who were qualified to serve in these positions. So I would hope—I would hope to\nsee greater diversity. It has b een a challenge to achieve that .\nCRAIG TORRES. Should the pro cess be more open somehow?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think the pr ocess has become more open, and in a number of\nthe recent searches there has been outreach—public outreach, in formation on websites,\nacceptance of potential names and nominees, and those have gott en careful consideration. There\nhas been—there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge the\npool and get suggestions, and I thi nk that’s appropriate, and I think it has move d in the direction\nyou’re suggesting.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER . Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. I’m\nwondering if you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, my colleague —I’ve had the pleasure of work ing with him now\nfor many years, and he is somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares\nits values. And as I mentione d in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of the\nFed; to its independence; and t o its acting in a nonpartisan, n onpolitical way. He is somebody\nwho has participated in the FOMC now for many years. To the be st of my knowledge, he has\n\nbeen part of the consensus. I don’ t believe he’s ever dissente d. I think there is strong consensus\nin the Committee for the gradua l approach that we have been pur suing, and Governor Powell has\nbeen part of that consensus, so I feel he’s very well positione d and very knowledgeable of all the\nins and outs of everything tha t the Fed does. In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played\nan active role there—and in m onetary policy, and I have confide nce that he is very capable of\nsteering the Federal Reser ve in the years ahead.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Do you mean me, or—as long as everyone gets a tu rn. This is John\nHeltman with the American Banker. Sort of a related question to w hat Nancy was asking—there\nhave been some reservations among some Democratic senators rece ntly during Governor\nPowell’s confirmation hearing a nd during the markup of the reg relief bill about the approach\ntowards regulation that the new leadership appears to be adopti ng. Do you have any similar\nreservations about the new leader ship’s ability t o deregulate i n an evenhanded way that keeps an\neye towards the stability of the financial system and the—sort of, the advances that have come\nfrom post-crisis regulation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would say that all of my colleagues on the Board have expressed\na strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financial\nsystem. And I’m considering th ere stronger capital, particular ly for the most systemic\ninstitutions—higher-quality capit al, stronger liquidity require ments, a rigorous stress-testing\nprogram, and resolution planning that will make it more possibl e to resolve a firm that\nencounters signifi cant distress.\nSo I have heard broad-based commitm ent to those things, and I t hink they are the core of\nthe reforms we have put in plac e. I think all of us agree that it is appropriate t o tailor regulatory\nrequirements in all of those are as and others to the systemic f ootprint of firms. We have done a\n\nlot to do that, and I think ther e is more that could be done, a nd in some areas it would require\nlegislation in order to do that . But I believe all of my colle agues and I are in agreement on that,\nand we’re also focused on commun ity banks and want to find ways to relieve burdens. So in\nthose important ways, I do think t hat all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect to\ntheir priorities.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Are there any important differences between your colleagues and\nyour vision on regulatory reform?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I have not seen a nything emerge at this point that I would describe\nas a significant difference.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard S chneider with Reuters. So you m entioned in\nresponse to Steve’s question t hat asset valuations, you didn’t think, were on the sort of high-\npriority risk list right no w. So I’m wondering, what do you th ink is on that risk list? And, more\nbroadly, what have you left undone ? You’ve gotten high marks f or bringing the economy back\ntowards its goals, but are the re things that are going to nag y ou when you walk out of here in\nFebruary and say, “Really, I wis h I’d seen this to completion”? I mean, we’re not doing negative\ninterest rates. We’re not doing i nflation framework. What’s a t your top of—what’s at the top of\nthe to-do list that you are not getting to see to bring to grou nd here?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So you asked about t he risk list. There are alw ays risks that affect the\noutlook. We tend to focus in our ow n evaluation on economic ri sks, and we’ve characterized\nthem as “balanced.” And I t hink they are balanced. You know, I can always give you a list of,\nyou know, potential troubles, interna tional developments that c ould result in downside economic\nrisk. But, look, at the moment t he U.S. economy is performing well. The growth that we’re\nseeing, it’s not based on, for ex ample, an unsustainable buildu p of debt as we had in the run-up\n\nto the financial crisis. The global economy is doing well. We ’re in a synchronized expansion.\nThis is the first time in many y ears that we’ve seen this. Inf lation around the world is generally\nlow. So I think the risks are ba lanced, and there’s less to lo se sleep about now t han has been true\nfor quite some time, so I feel good about the economic out—the economic outlook.\nI feel, you know, good that th e labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was\neight years ago. We have created 17 million jobs. We’ve got a good, strong labor market and a\nvery low unemployment rate, and I think that’s been tremendousl y important to the well-being of\nAmerican households and workers . And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firms\nthat tell me they’re having a hard time finding workers, and th ey talk about, given that they’re\ntaking on people with skills that don’t quite match what they w ant, but they’re training them,\nand, you know, giving them the traini ng that they need in order to be able to fill jobs. I think\nthat’s a development that is a natural one that occurs in a str ong labor market that tends to build\nhuman capital and worker skills , and that that’s a strong posit ive.\nAs I mentioned, I think the finan cial system is on much sounder footing, and that we have\ndone a great deal to put in place gr eater capital, liquidity, a nd so forth that ma ke it less crisis\nprone, and that has been a n important objective.\nWhat’s on my “undone” list, you ask? We have a 2 percent symme tric inflation\nobjective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been r unning under 2 percent. And I\nconsider it an important prior ity to make sure that inflation d oesn’t chronically undershoot our\n2 percent objective, and I wa nt to see it move up to 2 percent. So most of my colleagues and I do\nbelieve that it’s being held dow n by transitory factors, but th ere’s work undone there, in the\nsense—we need to see it move up in line with ou r objective.\n\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Chair Y ellen, what do you think will be the drivers of\ninflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with low\nunemployment, low inflation befo re you rethink monetary policy— this gradual rate hikes?\nThank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, I think f or a number of years—so w e’ve had an\nundershoot of inflation for a numbe r of years. We absolutely r ecognize that. I think until this\nyear, undershoot was understandab le. First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market.\nThen we had plummeting oil pr ices. And, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked\ndepreciation in the dollar.2 And those three factors hel d down inflation for a number of y ears.\nNow, in 2016, core inflation came very close to 2 percent. We seemed to be on a path of\ninflation moving up, and this ye ar, beginning in March, there s eemed to be a sequence of\nnegative surprises. Some reflec t one-time factors that were ea sily identifiable, like a marked\ndecline in quality-adjusted cel l phone plans. There may be oth er factors that are not so easy to\nname, but we would judge—you know, inf lation doesn’t always fol low exactly. There are errors\nand many factors that affect i t beyond the key influences of la bor market slack: exchange rates\nand import prices and oil prices . Those are three big ones. B ut there are other factors that affect\ninflation too, and our judgment at this point is that transitor y factors that are unrelated to the\nbroader macroeconomic outl ook are holding inflation down.\nBut I have tried to be straightfo rward in saying that this coul d end up being something\nthat is more ingrained and tur ns out to be permanent. It’s ver y important to watch it and, if\nnecessary, rethink what’s determ ining inflation. A possibility is that the longer-run sustainable\n\n2 Chair Yellen intended to say that, beginning in mid-2014, ther e was a marked appreciation of the dollar.\n\nrate of unemployment is—it’s b een coming down. Estimates in th e Committee have come down.\nIt’s conceivable that they n eed to come down even more.\nIt’s not my judgment that inflat ion expectations have slipped, but that also remains a\npossibility that needs to be monitored. So there are—you know, there could be a rethink of\ninflation. I think it’s importa nt to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t see\ninflation moving in the manner that the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we do\nachieve our 2 percent ob jective. But, at the moment, most of m y colleagues and I believe we are\non track to achieve it.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Chair Ye llen. Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.\nI’m wondering, you mentioned this i s your last news conference. What are your plans when you\nstep down from the Fed? Are you going to remain in Washington? Will you go back to\nBerkeley? And, also, I’m curi ous if you have any disappointmen t that you’re not going to be\ncontinuing in this job as some of your predecessors have done.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, on my plans, I don’t have anything definite for you, I guess. I\nhave a home in Berkeley and expect to maintain it. But I would say, my spouse is on the\nfaculty—he’s a professor at Geo rgetown and would like to stay i n his job, and we expect to\nmaintain Washington as our base . But I don’t have any definite plans.\nLet’s see. And you asked me if I’m disappointed. So let me ju st say that I have served in\nsenior positions in the Federal Reserve now for quite a long ti me. I became president in San\nFrancisco in 2004, and I’ve particip ated in the FOMC since that time as president, as Vice Chair,\nand as Chair, and it’s been an imm ensely rewarding experience f or me. I feel very positive about\nwhat we’ve been able to accomplish and feel tremendous, you kno w, loyalty to the institution.\nSo I did make the judgment that this is the right time for me t o leave, but I feel I have served in\n\nsenior positions at the Fed for a long time, and it’s really be en an honor and a priv ilege for me to\nhave had a chance to do so.\nADAM SHAPIRO. Adam Shapiro with Fox Business. Glad to hear yo u’re staying on\nthe East Coast. I’m just curi ous, I wanted to follow up to the bitcoin questions, but—because\nyou’ve lived through what we a ll experienced in 2007, 2008, and —should the Fed take a more\nactive role in trying to iden tify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is with\nbitcoin as a potential threat to f inancial stability? Just—the best minds at the Fed can sometimes\nmiss these kinds of threats. Your predecessor, Mr. Bernanke, a ctually said in ’07 that the\ncontagion from subprime would not affect the housing market or the economy. So are we\nunderestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up in value?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I certainly a gree that it’s important for the Fed to attempt to\nunderstand emerging risks to finan cial stability and to be look ing not just in the banking system\nbut outside it for developments t hat could pose financial risks , and we are doing that. And, I\nwould say, one of the changes durin g my tenure is, we devoted—d ecided in the aftermath of the\ncrisis that we needed to devote considerable resources to finan cial stability to monitor for\nemerging threats, and now we have a t the Board a full-blown div ision of financial stability that’s\ninvolved in doing that.\nNow, when you ask about bitcoin, I still see the financial stab ility risks from it as limited.\nOften, risks threatening financial stability arise when there’s exposure of the banking system to\nfluctuating asset valuations, a nd I really don’t see any signif icant exposure of our core financial\ninstitutions to threats from b itcoin if its value were to fluct uate. I don’t see a threat to our core\nfinancial institutions. So, undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if\n\nbitcoin were to fall in price , but I really don’t see that as c reating a full-blown financial\nstability risk.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee fr om Bloomberg Television and Rad io. I suppose\nI should be asking you a valedictor y question since it’s the la st question, but I don’t think you\ncan top what you’ve already said, s o let me just do a couple of cleanup questions here. President\nTrump, while you were speaking, jus t said that he thinks his ta x plan will produce 4 percent\ngrowth. Do you think that is pos sible? Second, do you think t hat there is any Fed blame or\ncomplicity in the flattening of the yield curve, and are you wo rried that there might be some sort\nof policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy? And the last question, which is a\nbit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you for four years.\nSince this is your last press conference, can you tell us which dot is yours? [Laughter]\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I can answer the last question first. The answer is “no.” I’ve\nnever been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I’m not goi ng to change that now.\nSo, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants’ ass essments, as I said, of the\nimpact of the tax policy on grow th has been informed by work by the Joint Committee on\nTaxation and other analysts. A nd everyone recognizes that ther e’s uncertainty about what the\neconomic effects would be, and I w ouldn’t want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however,\nto achieve growth of the level s that you mentioned. Look, if t he package were to stimulate\ngrowth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Re serve would welcome that. If it’s\na supply-side—favorable supply-si de developments that would be compatible with the\nattainment of our employment a nd inflation objectives, that’s s omething that would be very, very\nwelcome. But it would be challe nging to achieve numbers like t hat.\n\nLet’s see, I think you also then ask ed me about the yield curve , and—I mean, there is\nmuch discussion about yield curve inversions and whether or not a flattening yield curve could\nsignal a recession. Is that t he brunt of your question?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. And whether the F ed has made—if there’s a polic y mistake\nembedded in that.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So this is somethi ng that we discussed and have looked at. The yield\ncurve has flattened some as we have raised short rates. It mai nly—the flattening yield curve\nmainly reflects higher short-t erm rates. The yield curve is no t currently inverted, and I would\nsay that the current slope is we ll within its historical range.\nNow, there is a strong correla tion historically between yield c urve inversions and\nrecessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causat ion, and I think that there are good\nreasons to think that the relati onship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle\nmay have changed. And one reason for that is that long-term in terest rates generally embody\ntwo factors. One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second\npiece of it is a so-ca lled term premium that often reflects thi ngs like inflation—inflation risk.\nTypically, the term premium historically has been positive. So when the yield curve has\ninverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well above average expected short rates\nover the longer run. So with the positive term premium, that’s what it means. And typically that\nmeans that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite rest rictive, and some of those\nrecessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tig htening monetary policy because\ninflation was high and trying to slow the economy.\nWell, right now the term premiu m is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that\nmeans that, structurally—and thi s can be true going forward—tha t the yield curve is likely to be\n\nflatter than it’s been in the pa st. And so it could more easil y invert. If the Fed were to even\nmove to a slightly restrictiv e policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium.\nSo I think the fact the term pr emium is so low and the yield cu rve is generally flatter is an\nimportant factor to consider. Now , I think it’s also important to realize that mar ket participants\nare not expressing heightened conc ern about the decline of the term premium, and, when asked\ndirectly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I would concur with that judgment.\nThanks very much."
