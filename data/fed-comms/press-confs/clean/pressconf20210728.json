  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour asset pur chases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our\nbalance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete.\nProgress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal poli cy actions are also providing strong\nsupport to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to\nstrengthen , and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in\ndecades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed\nlevels.\nThe sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have\nnot fully recovered. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the\nongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support . The housing sector remains\nvery strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near -term\nsupply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are pa rticularly acute in the motor\nvehicle industry, where worldwide shortage s of semiconductors ha ve sharply curtailed\nproduction so far this year.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove. Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the\n\nleisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Nonetheless, the labor market has\na ways to go.\nThe unemployment rate in June —in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the\nshortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able t o\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation has increased notably and will lik ely remain elevated in coming months before\nmoderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward\npressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than\nanticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal. Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pas s-through\nof past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although\nthese base effects and energy effects are receding .\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other\nconstraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that\n\ninflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. O ur new framework for\nmonetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well -anchored inflation expectations, both\nto, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad -based and inclusive\nmaximum -employment goal.\nIndicators of lon g-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-\nrun inflation goal of 2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation\nexpectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal,\nwe’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy.\nThe effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the\neconomic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID -19.\nHowever, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the D elta strain of the virus is spreading\nquickly in some areas. Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more\nnormal economic conditions .\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and\nlonger -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an\naccommodative stance of m onetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\nachieved.\nWith regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain\nthe current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market co nditions\n\nhave reached level —levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time.\nIn addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury\nsecurities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month\nuntil substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum- employment and price -\nstability goals. Our asset purchas es have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial\nstability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster\naccommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, t he Committee continued to discuss the\nprogress made toward our —toward our goals since the Committee adopted it s asset purchase\nguidance last December. We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases\nmight be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a\nchange. Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of\n“substantial further progress .” In coming meetings , the Committee will again assess the\neconomy’s progress toward our goals , and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset\npurchases will depend on the incoming data. As we ’ve said, w e will provide advance notice\nbefore making any changes to our purchases.\nOn a note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a\ndomestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities. These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of mo netary policy and smooth market functioning.\n\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Steve Liesman with CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman , I wonder if you might be\nable to put some, I don’ t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of\n“substantial further progress. ” What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or , or, or\nciting data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today? And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Great. Thank you. So more deta il on substantial further progress.\nSo let’s talk about the maximum -employment part of that. As you know, with maximum\nemployment —unlike with, with price stability , where we can target a number of 2 percent on\naverage—with maximum employment, there isn ’t a single number that we can target. That the —\nwe monitor a broad range of , of, of data about different aspects of the labor market. There ’s\nunemployment, unemployment among different , different age groups , and such. There ’s\nparticipation. There ’s wages. There ’s all kinds of flow data. And we look at all of it to try to\narrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment.\nSo there isn ’t—I can ’t give you a , a, a set of numbers —for example, a numerical\nthreshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was. We didn’ t do that here. What we\nsaid was substantial further progress toward our goals. And what we said was, we would keep,\n\neffectively, we ’d—we would give advance warning as we —and, and, you know, more and more\nclarity —as, as we move forward. And that ’s what we ’re going to try to do.\nSo what would substantial further progress be? I’d say we have some ground to cover\non, on the labor market side. I think we ’re, we’re some way away from , from having had\nsubstantial further progress with , with max —toward the maximum -employment goal. I would\nwant to see some strong job numbers. And , and that ’s, that’s kind of the idea.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation.\nYou didn’ t—does it mean you feel like you’ ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation\nside? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and ha s\nbeen for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months\nbefore we believe it ’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective. The question whether we ’ve\nmet that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make. I can ’t—I can ’t do that by\nmyself. But it ’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent. And , and,\nagain, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target.\nMICHE LLE SMITH. Thank you. A nn Saphir with Reuters.\nANN SAPHIR. Hello. Can you hear me? [No response] Hello. Can you hear me? I’m\nsorry.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, yes. We can hear you.\nANN SAPHIR. I apologize. I —just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you\nknow, is it —is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know,\n\nbefore a taper? And , and , and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into\nyour thinking on, on the taper ? Thanks.\nCHAI R POWELL. So, as you know, we ’re, we’re in a process now where what we said\nis that as —at this meeting and in coming meetings, we ’re going to be continuing to assess the\neconomy’ s progress toward our goals and give advance notice. We’ ll be—try to provide\nadditional clarity about our thinking, both in the —in the postmeeting statement and in the\nminutes and in the public comments that people make.\nYou know, our , our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can. We have not\nreached substantial furt her progress yet. So we ’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as\nhaving some —we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there. So that ’s what I\nwould say.\nIn terms of —in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I ’ll say a couple things. Of\ncourse, it will have significant health consequences for many. And we need to keep that in mind\nbefore we start —before we mention and move to the economic questions. This is a— rising\ncases in , in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite\nsignificantly. We’ ll see.\nWhat we’ ve seen, though, is with successive waves of , of COVID over the past year and\nsome months now, there has tended to be less economic —less in the way of economic\nimplications from each wave. And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.\nBut it’ s, you know, it ’s a—it’ s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation.\nSo it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of\nthe risk of infection. Dining out, traveling, schools might —some schools might not reopen. We\nmay just —we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on , on the return to\n\nthe labor market. Some people might choose —again, we , we don’ t have a strong sense of how\nthat might work out, so we ’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Hi, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. In your\nopening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above\n2 percent this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some\ntime, and I noticed you didn’ t repeat that qualification last month or today. And , and so, in your\nview, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for\nsome time?\nCHAIR POWELL . That , that would, again, be a quest ion for the Committee. But I\nwould really say , the guidance that you’ re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff,\nright? That ’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions\nconsistent with full employment, infla tion at 2 percent and on track to run —to run moderately\nabove 2 percent for some time. It really isn ’t relevant now. It—because we’ re really —we ’re\nlooking at , at tapering asset purchases.\nWe’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It ’s not something\nthat, that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we\nstart to get to the question of , of liftoff, which , which we are not at all at now or near n ow, that ’s\nwhen we ’ll ask that question. That is when that , that will become a real question for us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder\nif you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting [inaudible]. You know, does that affect ,\n\naffect how you’ re thinking about tapering? Does it affect how you ’re thinking about, you know,\npotential liftoff down the road? And if you could, just talk a little bit about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Jeanna, I ’m sorry. For the first 15 seconds of your question, you\nfroze. Could you—could you say that again? I apologize.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Oh, ye s. No. Sorry. Ye s. So I was wondering if you could talk a\nlittle bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we ’re\nseeing around the world impacts how the F ed thinks about its policies. So do you take into\naccount that sort of multispeed recovery when you’ re thinking about tapering QE, and do you\ntake, take it into account when you’ re thinking about liftoff?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So it ’s an—it’s an important feature of this re covery is how\nuneven it is. And , in many cases, that ’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in\nthe way of access to , to vaccines. And so they’ re seeing significant outbreaks, and it ’s weighing\non economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular —are\nhaving a very strong rebound. And , and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well.\nSo it’s a feature of our economy. Now, how does it affect our policy? In, in a couple of\nways, potentially. One just is that, in general, economies —and through financial markets and\nthrough trade —are, are deeply interconnected now. And so a stronger global economy will lead\nto more U .S. exports. And , and, you know, that ’ll help economic activity. To the extent the\nglobal economy is weak and the United States is strong, it ’ll—we ’ll wind up , you know, we ’ll\nwind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having , having a lot\nof exports. That’s one way.\nAnother way, though, is more on the risk side. And that is, as long as COVID is running\nloose out there, as long as there ’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’ s\n\nreally finally safe. These , these strains —there ’s no reason they just can ’t keep coming and one,\nyou know, one more powerful than the next. We don’ t know that. But that’ s, that’s, that’s\ncertainly a plausible outcome. Now, as , as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our\neconomic activity. But, you know, it , it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our\ninterest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James at the FT.\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, how would you describe the\nrisks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?\nDo you believe the risks are, you know, tilted to the upside? And does the Committee share that\nview? Or are they in balance? Are you s till worried that there could be a hit to demand from,\nfrom the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again? If you could give us a\nsense of that, that would be very helpful.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. I ’d be glad to. So if you look, agai n, if you look at the , the\nmost recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected.\nBut essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn ’t the kind of\ninflation that’ s spread broadly across the economy. It’ s new, used , and rental cars . It’s airplane\ntickets . It’s hotels . And it’s a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it\nthat is —that is really about the reopening of the economy.\nSo we look at that , and we think that those are temporary things because the , the supply\nside will respond. The economy will adapt. We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market. And it ’s a real —a real asset that we have. And so we think that\ninflation should move down over time. Now, we don’ t have any—much confidence, let ’s say, in\nthe timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say, in the near term, that\n\nthe, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside. I , I, I have some confidence in the—in\nthe medium term, that inflation will move back down. Again, it ’s hard to say when that w ill be.\nI, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we —inflation is half of our mandate. Price\nstability is half of our mandate. And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently\nthat were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent .\nSo we won ’t have an extended period of , of high inflation. We think that , that some of it\nwill, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through. And it\ncould take some time. In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure\nthat we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria at Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. So b ond market pricing seems to suggest that\ninvestors think the F ed might eventually overtighten. So my question is, do you think that\nmarkets have bought into the central bank’ s new framework? And how do you balance that with\nmanaging inflation concerns?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so in terms of what’ s been happening in bond markets, I don’ t\nthink there ’s a real consensus on , on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this\nmeeting. We ’ve seen the long- term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real\nyields, which may have been connected to—some speculate —connected to sentiment around the ,\nthe spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth.\nThere was also some decli ne in inflation compensation, which ha s significantly reversed.\nAnd there , there are also so -called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can ’t\nquite explain. So I , I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that chal lenges the\n\ncredibility of our framework, if, if that’s really your question. We are committed to achieving\n2 percent average inflation over time.\nWhat we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels\nof employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’ t be enough for us to raise interest rates\nuntil we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We’ve got,\nyou know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people , at work than were at work before the pandemic.\nSo we ’re, you know, we ’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment. But we have\nhigh inflation, so it ’s kind of the opposite case. And we have to—we have to deal w ith that.\nAny central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is\nbroad based and likely to be persistent and , and, and whether inflation expectations are\nimplicated in a way that , that could cause them to rise. So we ’re monitoring that very carefully,\nand we ’re prepared to use our too ls as appropriate. But, again, I think our —I think our\nframework is pretty well understood. And , and I think the real test of it will be down the road\nwhen it ’s time to think about raising interest rates and , and how we assess, assess that set of\nissues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Rich at Bloomberg.\nRICH MILLER. Thanks very much, Michelle. Chairman Powell, you, you just alluded\nto the fact that you ’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if\ninflation looks like it’s getting out of control. I want to just try to understand that in the context\nof the framework and the forward guidance. Does that mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest\nrates even if we’ re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of\ninflation? And , and, two, does it also mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you\nare still buying assets? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So there ’s a—there ’s a part in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals\nand, and M onetary P olicy S trategy, which, Rich, I ’m sure —I’m sure you’ re familiar with, which ,\nwhich talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension. M ost of the time, if you have\nhigh inflation, you also have high employment —they, they tend to go together. This is a\nsituation where they ’re temporarily in different directions. We’re not at full employment, but we\nare having high inflation.\nWe feel like we’ re going to be making good progress over the next —over the course of\nthe next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment. This is a very strong labor\nmarket. If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we ’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low\nunemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum . That, that’s, that’s the\npath that we ’re on, and, and it shouldn’ t take that long in macroeconomic time to ge t there.\nSo that ’s, that’s what I think is , is really the likely case. And, again, it ’s not —it’s not\ntimely for us to be thinking about , about raising interest rates right now. What we’ re doing is ,\nwe’re, we’re looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and\njudging how we —how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering\nafter that.\nThe question you asked about , would we raise rates if we hadn ’t finished cutting —hadn’ t\nfinished the taper, hypothetica l question. You know, we ’d, we’d face the circumstance at th e\ntime. We could always just —you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset\npurchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that. But it ’s, it’s, it’s just hard to —it’ s hard to\nanswer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation. Ideally, you wouldn’ t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you ’re adding\n\naccommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates. So that wouldn’ t\nbe ideal. I ’ll say that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So t hank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for\ntaking the question. Now , so you’ re talking about jobs. You just said we ’re on a path to a very\nstrong job market. You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor\nmarket survey and 9.2 million job openings. So what ’s the—what ’s the disconnect? Is it a skills\ngap? Is it the extended unemployment benefits? Is it the fact that people just aren ’t willing to\nrelocate? What is the disconnect there?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’ s a—it ’s a really unusual situation to have —to have the ratio of\nvacancies to unemployed be this high. And we think there are a number of things at work there.\nMaybe the place to start is, is just to say that this is n ow not so much about people going back to\ntheir old jobs. It’ s about finding a new job. So that ’s a time- intensive, labor -intensive process.\nAnd there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There, there’ s research that suggests that\nthere is a speed lim it on that. So it ’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of\nthe recovery going back in a single month because they’ re just going back to their old job. This\nis about job selection, things like that. There may also be some factors th at are —that are holding\npeople back, and that ’s—this is what surveys say. There are people who, who are reluctant to go\nback to work because they still feel exposed to COVID. These could be jobs where , where there\nwas a lot of , of interaction with the public and where perhaps there ’s a family member who ’s\nvulnerable or for whatever reason.\nThere ’s also caretakers who are—where , where schools are not fully open and parents are\nat home or taking care of , of, of older people. And there ’s also been very generous\n\nunemployment benefits, which are now rolling off. T hey’ll be —they’ll be fully rolled off in a\ncouple of months. And all of th ose factors should , should wane. And, you know, we , we think\nwe should see , because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward.\nI mean, ultimately, it’ s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context\nwhere there are that m any unemployed people. That many job openings would typically suggest\na tight labor market. And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it ’s very\nhard to hire people. And that may be because people , people are shopping carefully for their\nnext job. I mean, I , I, I think the bottom line on this is , people want to work. If you look at\nwhere labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire. Some\npeople will retire. But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they’ ll find their\nway into the jobs that they want. It may take some time, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of\neconomic implications from each wave of COVID cases. Could you elaborate on what you’ ve\nseen to that end during pre vious waves? And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor\nmarket to the Delta variant?\nI’m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in\ntravel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering the ir travel plans or if\ncaretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening . How do you see\nsome of those risks going forward? Thank you so much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you remember the , the summer wave last year of\nCOVID, which was largely southern and w estern states, the economy just performed much better\n\nthan anyone expected. You know, we , we were coming off the spring wave , where there were a\nlot of shutdowns. And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to\nexpect that , that it would have a real impact on the economy. And i t was much less than , than\npeople thought.\nPeople —what ’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated. They ’re going on\nwith their lives. Secondly, we ’ve kind of lea rned to live with it. A lot of industries have , have\nkind of improvised their way around it —particularly, for example, buying a new home . That ,\nthat process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process. And so they were able to , you know, to, to do that. And other industries as well have gone to take -out\nand, you know, no- contact things. It ’s—so that can all —it seem s like we’ ve learned to , to\nhandle this .\nNow, I think people would like to get back to, to , you know, the way things were. And I ,\nI, I hope to some extent, we will over time. You know, of course, the big wave we had last\nwinter did have significant emplo yment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure\nand other entertainment —other , other areas with a lot of direct contact. A lot of jobs were lost\nthen because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last yea r, just\nbefore the vaccines arrived.\nSo with Delta, we ’re just going to have to watch. Again, with , with, with a reasonably\nhigh percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective —we ’re not\nexperts on this —but it , it seems like the—a good —a good going- in estimate would be that the\neffects will probably be less. There probably won’ t be significant lockdowns and things like\nthat. But, again, those , those are not decisions for us or , or, or —nor is it something we ’re be —\nwe’d be expert in.\n\nIn terms of the , the, the channels, you know, I —this is —this is kind of speculation, but\nit’s pretty —it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or\ntwo for the —for the —for the Delta wave to go . I’m not saying this ’ll happen, but that it ’s easy\nto imagine that. It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what? I ’m just\ngoing to—I ’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn’ t be\nhard to imagine tha t happening.\nIf, if schools don’ t open, then caretakers have to stay home. And if people don’ t go back\ninto the labor force, then the job growth won’ t be as strong, those kinds of things. So I don’ t—it\ndoesn’ t—it doesn’t —again, sitting here today , not being able to really know the future —it\ndoesn’ t seem as though the effects will be very large. But there may be effects. And they—it\nmay be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months —or not. There\nare many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we ’re just going to have to,\nto see what the economic effects are.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Now we ’ll go to David Gura at NPR.\nDAVID GURA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to ask if you’ ve started dr afting\nyour Jackson Hole speech, but I ’m going to go in a —in a different direction here. Steve\nLiesman ask ed you about semantics. I’m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the\nterm “ transitory ,” because I think of you as somebody who’ s so lucidly explained policies and\nprograms in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to , to the American\npublic as a whole. I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don’ t know\nit definitionally, don ’t know what it means , and see prices going up and wonder how long they ’re\ngoing to have to wait.\n\nSo just some broader definition from you—I ’d like to hear just about what it means or\nhow you understand it. And, and quickly a s well, you’ ve talked about vaccines a bit. And your\ncolleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that\nFederal Reserve Bank. And I wonder if that ’s something that you would like to see or expect to\nsee S ystemwide going forward.\nCHAIR POWELL. The concept of “transitory ” is really this: It is that the increases will\nhappen. We ’re not saying they will reverse. That ’s not what “transitory ” means. It means that\nthe increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will\nstop so that —so that there won’ t be further—when , when we think of inflation, we really think\nof inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That ’s inflation.\nWhen you have inflation for 12 mo nths or whatever it might be —I’m just taking an\nexample ; I’m not making an estimate —then, then you have a price increase, but you don’ t have\nan inflation process. And so part of that just is that, if it doesn ’t affect longer- term inflation\nexpectations, t hen it ’s very likely not to infect —to affect the process of inflation going forward.\nSo what , what I mean by “transitory ” is just something that doesn ’t leave a permanent\nmark on the inflation process. Again, we don’ t mean —I don’ t mean that, that, that, t hat, you\nknow, producers are going to take those price increases back. That’s, that’s not the idea. It’s just\nthat they won’ t go on indefinitely. So to the extent people are , are, are implementing price\nincreases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something ’s going up, you know,\nthe question, really , for inflation really is, does that mean they ’re going to go up the next year by\nthe same amount?\nSo you’ re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process , gets going. And,\nand that happens because people ’s expectations about future inflation move up. And we don’ t\n\nthink that ’s happening. There ’s no evidence that it ’s happening. All the evidence is that it’s not\nhappening. But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is —you know,\nwe have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability. Price stability , for us , means\ninflation averaging 2 percent over time. And so we ’ve got to be very careful about that.\nBut, but I, I, I think it ’s a good point that it ’s, it’s a term —what it really means is\ntemporary. But then you’ ve got to understand that it doesn’ t mean that the —that the increases\nwill be taken back. Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means.\nIn terms of —so we ’re, we’re working virtually here, and we ’ll be coming back down the\nroad in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the B oard of G overnors in\nWashington. And, you know, we ’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that.\nWe really haven ’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like. And\nit’ll depend on, to some extent , on what —on what , you know, CDC guidance looks like when we\nactually do bring people back in.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Chairman, I want ed to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline\nin the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data. And the statement says that\nthe Fed is going to use —to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and\ninflation, in coming meetings. Does that suggest that we wouldn’ t see anything before\nSeptember or November in your meetings? And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you ’re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole. Is that —is that the plan,\nor are we not going to see anything until the fall?\nCHAIR POWELL. So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not —if I— if I said\nwe’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I ’m not meaning to suggest\n\nanything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really h ave not made that\ndecision. All I ’m saying is , is, we’re not at substantial further progress. There ’s a range of\nviews on, on what timing will be appropriate. And those views ultimately track , track back to\npeople ’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress toward s,\ntowards our —towards our goal.\nSo that ’s, that’s really what it is. And I , I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we ’re\ngoing to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace , and composition.\nBut, today, I ’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this , this was the first , really ,\nI would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace , and composition. And it was a good\nmeeting. And —but no decisions are made, and, and I ’m just not in a position to, to give you\nmuch guidance, really any guidance , on the actual timing.\nI—but I will say we ’re making progress. We expect further progress. And we expect\nthat, if, if things go well, then we will —we will reach that goal . And when we reach it and the\nCommittee is comfortable that we have reached it, then , then we’ll taper at that point. I can’t, I\nreally —there ’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole. You know, I ’m in—we ’re in the process\nof writing that speech. And I am going to give a speech, and —but I , I, I wouldn’ t want to —I\nwouldn’ t want to say what will be in there at this point.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that\nthe Fed has got the markets working well. And you’ ve got bank loans up. In other words,\nyou’ve stimulated demand. But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension\nfunds , are getting hammered by the low rates. And they’ re wondering if the bal ance hasn ’t\nstarted to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. W e—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the\ncritical phase of the crisis. They , they really helped us restore market function to these key\nmarkets, really, on which—on which , which are very, very important to our economy and the\nglobal economy. And then they were a big part of , of creating accommodative financial\nconditions to support demand. They were strongly needed.\nIt was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the\neconomy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now. So\nwe said we would taper when we —when we achieve substantial further progres s. And , and, you\nknow, we ’re going to honor that commitment. I mean, it ’s—and, and, again, we ’re talking about\nit right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction. We will taper when we\nreach that goal. And we ’ll provide more , you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is\nappropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. You ’ve been asked a lot previously i f the Fed ’s monetary policy\nat all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed ’s\nregulatory policy lands , particularly if you think that the Fed ’s bank capital requirements have\nhad the effect of penalizing lower -income households seeking loans. Basically, is it possible to\nachieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks,\nparticula rly for the largest banks. And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we ’ve\nseen, can be a real threat to the economy and most —mostly, or to , to the greatest extent, to\n\npeople at the lower end of the income spectrum. So if you look back at not this previous —not\nthis crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized.\nSo higher capital requirements are , are, you know, are , are really a good thing because\nthey allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.\nI think it ’s other tools that we have to —and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some\nof these tools , other agencies have some of these tool s—to assure or support the wide availability\nof credit, particularly to low - and moderate -income communities.\nSo that ’s CRA. We enforce CRA. We’ re working on a —on a new CRA proposal right\nnow with the other banking agencies, and we think it ’s going to be —it’s going to be good and\nwill support the flow of credit to low - and moderate -income households. It ’s also the anti —anti –\nlending discrimination statutes that we enforce . And it’s some of the programs that Congress has\nin place to support the flow of cr edit to low - and moderate -income communities. I , I don’ t think\nit’s capital standards at all. I think capital standards work the other way. Strong capital is what\nenables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low - and moderate -income\ncommunities.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I\nguess I wanted to ask about the last —when you were before Congress earlier this month, you\nmentioned, I think, something along the lines of , it won ’t take too long before we see if you’ re\nright about inflation and its temporary aspect. You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy. Can you tell us a li ttle more of what you mean by that?\nWhen do you think you’ ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions\nthat we ’re seeing now ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re , we look not just at\nthe headline number , but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.\nAnd if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that , widely , across the whole\nrange of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we ’re seeing upward , upward pressure\non prices. That ’s not really what we ’re seeing.\nWhat we’ re seeing is a handful of things that are really —that really account for the , the\novershoot of inflation. And , as I mentioned, it’ s things like cars. You know, new, used , and\nrental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor\nshortage. And housing —sorry, hotels and air , air fares have moved back up, but that really just\nis retracing the very large downward movement in prices t hat they had before.\nSo that ’s, that’s a big, big part of , of why the inflation readings are so high. And those\ndon’t—those , frankly , don ’t carry significant implications in the long run for the —for inflation\nor for the American economy. So what I said w as, we, we’re going to see whether these\nthings —we don’ t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done. So if you look at\nlumber prices, they went up and then they went down.\nSo what we want to see is these other things. D o they—do they—do the prices flatten\nout? Do they actually move down? If they flatten out, then their , their contribution to inflation\nbecomes zero over time so that they ’re not contributing to inflation. And so, if we start to see\nthose things happen fairly widely among the —among the things that have really moved up\nquickly, then we ’ll, we’ll —they won ’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we ’ll know\nthat our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct.\nAnd I don’ t think it will take , or what I said was , I don’ t think it’ ll take a very long time\nto see whether that ’s the case. It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the , the overall\n\nreopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time. This is a historic, world\nhistorical event , that the global economy is now reopening. It’s not going to—it ’s not going to\nhappen quickly. It ’s going to take some time.\nAnd it ’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before. But I think we will—we will\nknow, you know, when we know. But I don’ t think it will take that long. I don’ t want to put a\nnumber on it. But I do think that , that , if we see those things happening, we ’ll know that we\nhave the story basically right.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. I ’m just\nwondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you’ re thinking about\nmortgage -backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper. Withi n the context of home\nprices continuing to rise, we ’ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they’ d like to\ncool off on, specifically , the MBS purchases. Is that more because of the opt ics, or is it because\nthere ’s an observed relationship from the Committee ’s view between MBS purchases under QE\nand the hot housing market? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a number of participants raised that —the questions around MBS\nand tapering at , at today’ s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday ’s meeting. And I ’ll just say\nthat, generally speaking, I don’ t think and—I don’ t think that —I think th at Treasury and MBS\npurchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways. There may be modest differences in\nterms of , of contribution to housing prices, but it ’s, it’s not something that ’s big.\nIt’s not —it’s—so where I think we are is , there , there really is little support for the idea\nof tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries. I think we will taper them at the same time. It seems\nlikely, based on where people are now. The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat\n\nfaster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people —others , not so much.\nAnd I think it ’s something that we ’ll be continuing to discuss.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you very much. So I wanted to ask you about the standi ng\nrepo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions. And\nalso, kind of in a similarly related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger\nsince you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting. And, you know, are you concerned\nto see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do? So it , it\nreally is a backstop. So it ’s, it’s set at 25 basis points , so out of the money, and it ’s, it’s there to\nhelp address pressures in money market —money markets that could impede the effectiv e\nimplementation of monetary policy. So, really, it ’s, it’s to support the function of —functioning\nof monetary policy and its , its effectiveness. That ’s the purpose of it. And it ’s set up with that\npurpose in mind.\nYour question on, on the , the [ON] RRP, so we think it ’s doing what it ’s supposed to do,\nwhat we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range. You know, it ’s essentially ,\nessentially , what ’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal\nReserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight R RP balances.\nSo that , that ’s all that ’s really happening there. And we expect it to be high for some\ntime. It ’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and,\n\nand also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that. So we don’ t—\nwe don’t have a problem with, with what it ’s doing. It ’s kind of doing the job we expected .\nMICHAEL DERBY. And you don’ t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know ,\nmarkets from, you know, investing in private money market securities? You know, like , the idea\nthat the Fed’s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don’ t see any issues there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not , not really. Not at this point. I mean, money markets, private\nmoney market funds are , are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive. At some\npoint, the rates will not be so attractive as , as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and , and you’ ll\nsee it shrink back down.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Okay. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let ’s go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.\nGREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, I was going to go\nback to inflation a little bit. I ’m just kind of surprised by your tone. It , it seems like you ’re just\nsort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed will act. Isn’t it true that, I\nmean, a little inf lation is good for the economy and, and that we —if somehow maybe we can get\nthe economy out of this sort of place where we ’re always going to be close to the zero lower\nbound, i sn’t there a good story to tell, and you’ re sort of panicking people?\nCHAIR POWELL. I certainly don ’t, don’t have that in mind. No. Look, we—as you\nknow, we ’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time. We, we want\ninflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent . We feel like they may be a little bit below\nthat. So the bigger picture is that, you know, that , that, that would be a healthy thing. This is a\ndifferent thing. This is —this is not that. Th at was the kind of inflation we were thinking about\nthat comes from, you know , from a very, very strong labor market and a —and a booming\n\neconomy maybe. T hat, that was the kind of inflation —this, this is something different. This is\nreally driven by the s upply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand\nthat we ’re seeing. As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary\npolicy support, the supply side —just all over the world , you’ re seeing the same thing, whic h is, it\njust can ’t keep up. And there are labor shortages in , in a lot of places, the same sort of thing.\nSo, you know, there ’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic. I just— I’ve explained, I\nthink, several times here today that the best— my, my best estimate is that this is something that\nwill pass. It’s really a shock to the economy that w ill pass through. And, you know, if you—if\nyou look at where forecasters are— people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very,\nvery strongly they see it that way.\nNow, we —but, you know , are—we ’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to\ntake seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might\nactually move inflation expectations up, and that we might —that the kind of things that might\nrequire a response. We, again, we don’ t see that now. But we , we have to be on the alert for it.\nAnd people have to understand and believe that we will react if , if we need to. And we will.\nBut, again, it ’s not —it’s not my base case. My base case is that —is, as I ’ve said\nrepeatedly, is that inflation will move back down. And no, w e’re not —we , we have not at all\nchanged our view, and I haven’ t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent ,\nmoderately above 2 percent , is a desirable thing. This is not moderately above 2 percent . This is\nwell above 2 percent . But it ’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for. This is really\ndriven by a supply- side shock.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the\nlast question.\nDON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. I wonder if you could talk about wages. Many workers\nseem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months. What ca n workers generally\nexpect going forward? And it doesn ’t sound like you’ re concerned about rising wages feeding\ninto broader inflation . Is that right?\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages have moved up. A lot of that is driven by new hires. And\nit’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low -paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.\nSo that ’s not troubling. And we , we don’t see— there , there is a form of wage inflation that can\nlead to price inflation, and we ’re not seeing that r ight now.\nAnd that really is if what we call “ unit labor costs ” move up and, and, and, which really\nputs—move up in a way that is —that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a\nsituation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it\nhappens gradually, when that —if you —we ’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor\ncosts do move up and, and put some pressure on margins . In a long expansion, that ’s been\nhappening late in the expansion. That ’s not a problem, either.\nThe problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices. It was\ncalled the “ wage –price spiral. ” We don’ t see that now. This is something that was a featur e of\nthe high inflationary era of the G reat Inflation, but it ’s not a feature now. And w e don ’t see that\nnow. Of course, we ’ll be watching it.\nAnd this is one of the reasons why we ’re watching so carefully to see whether labor\nforce —whether people do com e back and accept jobs. Given the very large number of job\nopenings and the very large number of unemployed people, we ’d like to see, you know, those —\n\nsome matching going on there so people get back to work. We think labor supply would be —\nwould be a healt hy thing. You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with\ninflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Chair Powell. And thank you all."
