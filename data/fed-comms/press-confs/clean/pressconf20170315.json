  "text": "March 15, 2017\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¾ to\n1 percent. Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodatio n reflects the economy ’s continued progress toward the employment and price\nstability objectives assigned to us by law. For some time the Committee has judged that, if economic conditions evolved as anticipated, gradual increases in the federal funds rate would\nlikely be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives. Today ’s decision is in line with\nthat view and does not represent a reassessment of the economic outlook or of the appropriate course for monetary policy. I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy shortly, but first I ’ll\nreview recent economic developments and the outlook.\nThe economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Solid income gains and relatively\nhigh levels of consumer sentiment and wealth have supported household spending growth.\nBusiness investment, which was soft for much of last year, has firmed somewhat, and business sentiment is at favorable levels. Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.\nJob gains aver aged about 200,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the\nsolid pace we have seen over the past year. The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, near its recent low. Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low .\nParticipation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years. Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further si gn of improving conditions in the\nlabor market. Looking ahead, w e expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat further.\n\nTurning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in J anuary, up from less than 1 percent last summer. That\nrise was largely driven by energy prices, which have been increasing recently after earlier\ndeclines. Core inflation —which excludes volatile energy and food prices and tends to be a better\nindicator of future inflation —has been little changed in recent months at about 1¾ percent. We\nexpect core inflation to move up and overall inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective.\nLet me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by\nCommittee participants. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s\nassessment of the many factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth of\ninflation -adjusted gross domestic product is 2.1 percent this year and next , and edges down to\n1.9 percent in 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate. Th e median projection for the\nunemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remains at that level over the next two years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.\nFinally, the median inflation proje ction is 1.9 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and\n2019. These economic projections are very little changed from those made in December.\nReturning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal\nfunds rate is appropriate in light of the economy ’s solid progress toward our goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Today ’s decision also reflects our view that waiting too long to\nscale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime\n\ndown the road, which, in turn, could risk disrupting financial marke ts and pushing the economy\ninto recession.\nWe continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain our objectives. That ’s based on our\nview that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently\nquite low by historical standards. That means that the federal funds rate does not have to rise by all that much to get to a neutral policy stance. We also expect the neutral level of the federal\nfunds rate to rise somewhat over time, meaning that additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion. Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely to\nremain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\nThis view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appr opriate monetary policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, in line with its estimated longer -run\nvalue. Compared with the projec tions made in December, the median path for the federal funds\nrate is essentially unchanged.\nAs always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their\nassessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks. Changes in economic policies, including fiscal and other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is still too early to know how these policies will unfold. Moreover, fiscal policy is only one of many factors that can influence the outlook. In making our decisions, we will continue —as\n\nalways —to assess economic conditions relative to our dual mandate. As I ’ve noted previously,\npolicy is not on a preset course.\nFinally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and\nprincipal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities. This policy, by keeping\nthe Committee ’s holdings of longer -term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain\naccommodative financial conditions. As a matter of prudent planning, we discussed at this\nmeeting a number of issues related to an eventual change to our reinvestment policy. We made\nno decisions, and we will continue our disc ussion at subsequent meetings. In keeping with the\nprinciple that the process of normalizing our balance sheet will be gradual and predictable, we\nwill provide more information about our plans as it becomes available.\nThank you. I ’d be happy to take your questions.\nSAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Could I\ntake you up on the last topic, which is the balance sheet normalization ? Clearly you said you\ndon’t want to start pulling in the size of the balance sheet until no rmalization “ is well under\nway. ” Could you give us some sort of sense about what “ well under way ” means, at least in your\nmind? What kind of hurdles are you setting? What kind of economic conditions would you like\nto see? Is it just a matter of the lev el of the short -term federal funds rate as being the main issue?\nAnd what kind of role do you see the role of the balance sheet playing in the normalization\nprocess over the longer term? Is it an active tool, or is it a passive tool? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLE N. So let me start with the second question first. We ’ve emphasized for\nquite some time that the Committee wishes to use variations in the f ed funds r ate target —our\nshort -term interest rate target—as our key active tool of policy. We think it ’s much easier in\nusing that tool to communicate the stance of policy. We have much more experience with it and\n\nhave a better idea of its impact on the economy. So while the balance sheet , asset purchases are\na tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where we\nwere, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy , it’s\nnot a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy.\nYou asked what “ well under way ” means. I can’t give you a specific answer to that. And\nI think the right —the right way to look at it is in qualitative and not quantitative terms. It doesn’ t\nmean some particular cutoff level for the federal funds rate that, when we’ ve reached that level,\nwe would consider ourselves well under way. I think what we want to have is confidence in the\neconomy ’s trajectory , a sense that the economy will make progress, that we ’re not overly\nworried about downside risks and adverse shocks that could hit the economy that c ould\nquickly —after setting it off on the path to shrinking the balance sheet gradually over time —\ncause us to want to begin to add monetary policy accommodation. So I think it has to do with\nthe balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of the federal funds rate.\nJASON LANGE. Hi, thank you. Jason Lange with Reuters. You mentioned that you\ndon’t—that you don’ t—you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind the\ncurve. In the current context, “ gradual ” has been very, very gradual. Could you describe what a\nrapid rate of increases should be—how that should be understood?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I ’m not sure that I can tell you what “ a rapid rate of increases ” is.\nI think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections , which, this year, looks to a\ntotal of three increases. That certainly qualifies as gradual. My comfort in using the term\n“gradual ” comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral level of the federal funds rate—\nnamely , the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy operating on an even\n\nkeel, that it’ s a rate where we neither are pressing on the brake nor pushing down on the\naccelerator —that level of interest rates is quite low. So, at present, I see monetary policy as\naccommodative—namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, but\nnot very far below the neutral rate.\nWe’re closing in, I think, on our employment objective. We ’re coming closer on our\ninflation objective. As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we see the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced at this point —and that ’s been our assessment for the\nlast several meetings —it looks t o us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rate\nback in the direction of neutral. And exactly how many increases is that? You know, the SEP\ngives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense . But, you know,\nif it’s one more or one less, I think that still—that still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think , if\nyou compare it with any previous tightening cycle . I remember when rates were raised at every\nmeeting starting in mid -2004. And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measured\npace. And we ’re certainly not envisioning something like that.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Both the OECD and the IMF have raised\ntheir forecast s, in part because of —for the U.S. growth—in part because of the p olicies expected\nfrom the new A dministration , yet the Fed has not . And I take it from your comment at the very\nbeginning that this —these forecasts today represent no reassessment. Has the Committee\ndiscussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed or infrastructure spending passed? And what might policy look like if those policies become law?\nFinally, why did you remove the word “only” before the word “gradual ” when you talked about\nfuture rate increases?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that could\n\nbe put into place, and we have not tried to map out what our response would be to particular\npolicy measures. We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the ti ming, the size, the\ncharacter of policy changes that may be put in place a nd don’ t think that that’ s a decision, or a\nset of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will go into effect. So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscal\npolicy changes into their projections, that the basis for today ’s decision is simply our assessment\nof the progress of the economy against our long -established goals of maximum employment and\nprice stabi lity. There ’s nothing that we have done or anticipate that is a speculation. I think it ’s\nfair to say , there’ s nothing that ’s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy\nmoves. We have plenty of time to see what happens.\nWe did remove the word “only” in the statement today from “ gradual. ” I think this is\nsomething that shouldn’ t be overinterpreted. I regard it as a relatively small change and think\nit’s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of t he fact that our economic\nprojections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December. They ’re essentially\nunchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate. So we have carried out a modest adjustment o f the federal funds rate because we’ ve seen the\neconomy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated. We haven ’t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks. We had\nlong said that if the economy progressed, and—it’ s, you know, it ’s been doing nicely, I think, in\nmaking progress, in showing resilience , and we have, you know, have some confidence in the\npath the economy is on. And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it a s app ropriate to\nmake some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral , along the lines\nin the SEP.\n\nNow, obviously, there are surprises. Our economic forecast s can change. But the word\n“gradual, ” I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we’ ve been going, as we\nhave said now for quite some time, we think that gradual —some gradual increases in the federal\nfunds rate —will be appropriate. And this is not a, you know, this is not a significant —this is not\na significant ch ange.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business, ma’ am. Speaking of fiscal policy, have\nyou had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin? If not, when will\nyou meet with him? What do you want to talk to him about? And, separately, have you had a\nchance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him? And, if not, would you like to, and would you, and what would you talk about? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I ’m\ngetting to know him. And I think, you know, it ’s traditional for F ed Chairs and Treasury\nSecretaries to meet on a regular basis , and I fully expect to have a strong relationship with\nSecretary Mnuchin. We have had very good discussions about the econom y, about regulatory\nobjectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments , and I look forward to\ncontinuing to work with him. I was introduced to the President. I had a very brief meeting and\nappreciated that as well.\nANA SWANSON. Ana Swanson, the Washington Post. You said that the neutral level\nof the federal funds rate is quite low. How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate? And what do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years ? Could fiscal policy be among those?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I ’ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I ’ve\ndeveloped my views more fully. I would say, over the longer run—that means going several\n\nyears out —I think the evidence suggests that the neutral rate may be something , in real terms ,\nthat might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that. That would be consistent with the\nmedian longer -run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last several\nmeetings. Three percent is the longer -run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate . In\nreal terms , with a 2 percent inflation objective —that ’s 1 percent in real terms. And I ’ve\nindicate d—why is it so low? Well, I think there ’s very strong evidence tha t’s accumulated that\nthis rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations , and the\ndecline probably predates the financial crisis. I think in part it reflects slowing population\ngrowth and also slow productivity growth he re and in many other advanced nations. But some\nrecent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that , and\nsome estimates place it around zero in real terms. So I think the lower current rate arguably reflects headw inds that are left over from the financial crisis. One form of headwind, I think, has\nbeen caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that ’s held\nback spending decisions. And, I suppose, my judgment that it ’ll move u p over time reflects a\nnotion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years.\nSo that ’s a sense of where I think —now , there is uncertainty about the neutral rate. And,\nas you mentioned, it is —it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy. How the neutral rate i s\naffected by fiscal policy —that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscal\nshift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen,\nbetween the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech in Chicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quite dramatically. What happened over the course of thos e two weeks to make officials far more\n\ninterested in signaling the idea of raising rates at today ’s meeting? And why do you think the\nmarket was so out of sync with where the central bank was?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me\nto have been reasonably consistent over this entire period. We had indicated in December that\nwe expect —we saw the risks as balanced , and if the economy continued to progress along the\nlines we expected, that several rate increases wou ld likely be appropriate. The minutes of our\nJanuary meeting indicated that many participants thought that an increase in the f unds r ate would\nbe appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those line s. I indicated in my c ongressional\ntestimony tha t I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.\nAnd, as I think all of us —having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress\nalong the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced —do regard it as\nappropriate to gradually remove accommodation that ’s in place by having several interest rate\nincreases this year . As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations , my\ncolleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be our expectations.\nNow, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this is\nsomething I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago. And, of course, it is true that in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once , and perhaps market\nparticipants have been influenced by that pattern. I did try to explain the reasons why we had\nmoved so slowly during those two years. And it reflects, I think, a set of s hocks partly\nemanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments —reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate\nand the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate. S o I think there are reasons, but it is\n\nimportant for the public to understand that we ’re getting closer to reaching our objectives ; that\npolicy is accommodative ; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably\nquite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy ; and it will be appropriate to\ngradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we ’re on.\nBINYAMIN AP PELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. The Bank for\nInternational Settlements has raised concerns that central banks are being insufficiently attentive\nto asset price—excuse me, asset price inflation. And stock market investors in the United Stat es\ncertainly don ’t seem to be waiting for the Trump A dministration to actually implement its fiscal\npolicies. And I guess I ’m just curious to know how much of a concern that is for you. And, if\nnot, why not, given the remarkably elevated level of stock price evaluation s?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view of\nthe outlook, a nd stock prices do figure into financial conditions. So I think the higher level of\nstock prices is one factor that looks like it ’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.\nWe also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads , particularly for lower -grade\ncorporate issuers , have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become\nsomewhat easier. Now, on the other side, longer -term interest rates are up some in recent\nmonths, and the dollar is a little stronger. How does that net out? There are private- sector\nanalysts that produce financial conditions indices that attempt to aggregate all these diffe rent\nfactors affecting financial conditions. And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices,\nI think the conclusion they have reached is that financial conditions , on balance , have eased , and\nthat’s partly driven by the stock market. So that is a factor that affects the outlook.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. You and Secretary\nMnuchin will be meeting with your G -20 colleagues in Germany this weekend. What do you\n\nexpect to find there? Do you think the group assessment i s going to be that the world economy\nis finally out of the woods, doing better? Or do you think that there ’s still going to be worries\nabout risk? And would one of those risk worries be that the Fed might raise rates too quickly?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we always exchange views on the economic outlook and\ndevelopments in our country , and it will be my objective to explain —explain U.S. monetary\npolicy and to try to make the same points to them that I ’ve made here already today about what\nthe outlook is for m onetary policy in the United States. I think it ’s fair to say that the global\neconomy is doing better. It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I got\ntogether that the —with my counterparts in the G -20—that the risks do look somewhat more\nbalanced . But there remain a set of very significant risks , medium term, facing the global\neconomy , and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times . You said you\nand your col leagues aren ’t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many other\npeople are. Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election. Homebuilder\nsentiment today was at its highest level since 2005. Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending , don’ t get enacted\nor are delayed?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we recognize—our statement actually last time noted that there\nhad been an improvement , a marked improvement in business and household sentiment. It’s\nuncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions. And I wouldn’ t say at\nthis point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future. We exchange around the table what we learn from our many business contacts, and I think it ’s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much more\n\noptimistic frame of mind among many —many businesses in recent months. But , I’d say , most of\nthe bus iness people that we ’ve talked to also have a wait -and-see attitude and are very hopeful\nthat they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waiting\nto see what will happen. So we will watch that. And, of course, if we were to see a major shift\nin spending reflecting those expectations, that could very well affect the outlook. I’m not seeing\nit—I’m not seeing that at this point, but the shift in sentiment is obvious and notable.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Thank you, Madam Chair . Kate Davidson from Dow Jones.\nThere’ s a perception out there that the Fed could somehow stand in the way of some of the\neconomic growth policies that the new Administration is pursuing. Given that the Fed is projecting 1.8 percent growth in the long r un, is this a potential point of conflict for the Fed and\nthe new Administration?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I don’ t believe it is a point of conflict. We would certainly\nwelcome stronger economic growth in a context of price stability. And if policies were put i n\nplace to speed growth that I ’ve certainly urged Congress and the Administration to consider —\npolicies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy ’s so-called speed limit or\npotential to grow —I think that those would be —those would be very welcome changes that we\nwould like to see.\nKATHLEEN HAYS. Chair Yellen, Kathleen Hays. Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays from\nBloomberg. I’m going to try to take the opposite side of this because —on this question about\nmarket expectations and how the markets got things wrong, and then how you say the Fed\nsuddenly clarified what it already said. But, for example, if the —if you look at the Atlanta Fed ’s\nlatest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it’ s down to 0.9 percent. We had a retail sales report that\nwas m ixed. Granted the, you know, upward revisions of previous months make it look better,\n\nbut the consumer does not appear to be roaring in the first quarter, kind of underscoring the wait -\nand-see attitude you just mentioned.\nIf you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the statement that they ’re not\nmoving up, a nd, in fact, they are . And if you look at average —there are so many things you can\nlook at. And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps an\nindication there ’s still slack in the labor market.\nI guess my question is this : In another sense, what happened between December and\nMarch? GDP is tracking very low. Measures of labor compensation are not threatening to boost inflation any time fast. The consumer is not picking up very much. Fiscal policy —we don’ t\nknow what ’s going to happen with Donald Trump. And yet you have to raise rates now. So\nwhat is the —what is the motivation here? The economy is so far from your forecast in terms of\nGDP, why does the Fed have to move now? What does this signal, then, about the rest of the\nyear?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator. If one averages through several\nquarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year. And as you can see from our projections, we —that ’s something we expect to continue over the\nnext couple of years. Now, that pa ce of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation\nthat is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer -run trend with an aging population.\nNow, unemployment hasn’ t moved that much, in part because people have been drawn\ninto the labor force. Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flat\nover the last three years. So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several years\nthat it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that ’s been\n\ngood. It’s meant we ’ve had a great deal of job creation over these years. And there could be —\nthere could be room left for that to play out further. In fact, look, policy remains\naccommodative. We expect further improvement in the labor market. We expect the\nunemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years. So we do expect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some further strengthening in the labor market.\nKATHLEEN HAYS. [Inaudible] Just quickly , then, I just want to underscore —I want to\nask you, so following on that, you expect it to move. But w hat if it doesn ’t? What if GDP\ndoesn’ t pick up? What if you don’ t see wage measures rising? What if you don’ t—what if the\ncore PCE gets stuck at 1.7 percent ? W ould you— is it your view, perhaps, that if there ’s a risk\nright now in the median forecast for dots, that it ’s fewer hikes this year , rather than the\nconsensus , or more?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, look, our policy is not set in stone. It is data dependent , and\nwe’re—we ’re not locked into any particular policy path. Our —you know, as you said, the data\nhave not notably strengthened. I—there is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter , but\nwe haven ’t changed our view of the outlook. We think we ’re on the same path , not—we haven ’t\nboosted the outlook, projected faster growth. We think we ’re moving along the same course\nwe’ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market. I would\ndescribe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some. Some measures haven ’t\nmoved up, but there ’s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is also\nsuggestive of a strengthening labor market.\nAnd we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time. So we ’re—we’re\ntalking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress\n\nmoving toward neutral. But we ’re continui ng to provide accommodation to the economy that ’s\nallowing it to grow at an above -trend pace that ’s consistent with further improvement in the\nlabor market.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with the American Banker. A regulatory\nquestion, if I may. The Administration has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement of\nGlass -Steagall. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a “21st century Glass -Steagall. ”\nKeeping in mind that there are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea of\nseparating commercial banking from investment banking a fruitful line of inquiry? Is this the\nright path to be pursuing?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I ’ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line. I don ’t\nreally know what a “ 21st century Glass -Steagall” would look like. I think my reading on the\nfinancial crisis is that that wasn ’t the major source of the financial crisis. In fact, many of the\nproblems emanated from firms that were investment banking units. To me, an important reform\nin the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where —that\nwere a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built —that those were\nappropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity , and their management was strengthened, and\nthat’s what we have tried to do. But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are put\nforward. I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to.\nJOHN HELTMAN. So—so you don’ t think it’ s necessar ily [inaudible] a really good\nidea?\nCHAIR YELLEN. W ell, I don ’t think it was the cause of the financial crisis, and I do\nfeel that we have significantly strengthened supervision of bank holding companies that incorporate investment banking activities.\n\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Yellen. I’m Jo Ling Kent with NBC News. I just want to\nknow, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I think that ’s a great question . I appreciate your asking it. And the\nsimple message is , the economy is doing well. We have confidence in the robustness of the\neconomy and its resilience to shocks. It’s performed well over the last several years. We have\ncreated, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs. The\nunemploym ent rate has moved way down, a nd many more people feel optimistic about their\nprospects in the labor market. There i s job security. We ’re seeing more people who are feeling\nfree to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities. So I think the job market, which is an important focus for us, is certainly improving.\nThat’s not to say that it’ s a—good labor market conditions for every individual in the\nUnited States. We know there are problems that face, particularly , people with less skill and\neducation and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better —feel very much better about that. And inflation is moving —\nmoving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective. And we ’re operating in an environment\nwhere the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem pretty balanced. So I think people\ncan feel good about the economic outlook.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News. You emphasized in the\nstatement that the Fed ’s inflation target is “ symmetric. ” Would you be able to expand a little bit\non why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing to tolerate, and for how long?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word “symmetric ” in\nour statement of longer -run goals , and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce that\n\nword into the statement because we had previously indicated that there was a shortfall of\ninflation from our 2 percent objective. Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent. As I indicated, a better forward -looking measure of inflation, core inflation—t hat’s\nnot our target, but I think it ’s worth looking at because it ’s a better f orward -looking predictor of\nheadline inflation —I think that ’s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it’ s going\nto move up to 2. And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objective is is 2 percent inflation. Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent. It’s—like all economic\nvariables, it fluctuates. Sometimes it’ s going to be below 2 percent , sometimes it’ s going to be\nabove 2 percent. We ’ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent. As we\nmove back to 2 percent, which is where we ’re heading, there will be some times when it ’s above\n2 percent as well. And it ’s a reminder —2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, i t’s a target. It’s\nwhere we always want inflation to be heading. And t here will be some times when inflation is\nabove 2 percent, just like it ’s been below 2 percent. We ’re not shooting for inflation above\n2 percent , but it’ s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we ’re\nachieving our objective.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. How well can you tolerate an overshoot?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we would—if there were an overshoot and it appeared to be\npersistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent. That ’s the\ncore set of princip les that we have adopted in our statement on longer -run goals and strategy.\nAnd exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what was happening with respect to employment and our other objectives. So there ’s no hard a nd fast\nanswer to that.\n\nPATRICK GILLESPIE. Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN. Some fiscal policy\nproposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantly\nover a short period of time. I realize you can ’t comment on the specific policy proposal, but if\nthe dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent for whatever reason, what would—what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy, particularly in exports and manufacturing? And what do you think would be any implications\nfor U.S. monetary policy ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So that ’s a—that ’s a difficult question to answer. You asked that\nquestion not in an isolated way : What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be?\nBut, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment. Is that right?\nBecause the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rate adjustment is to raise the price of imported goods into the United States. And that large\nmovement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially —if it were complete,\nwould fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods. So, it wouldn’ t end up\nhaving an impact on U .S. inflation or GDP growth.\nBut a question that ’s a very different —that ’s a very different matter than if, suddenly , for\nsome reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because there were flight -to-safety flows into the dollar. I mean, if —if the latter were to occur, there were just\na big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downw ard pressure on inflation and would have a\nnegative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports. But that ’s a, that’s a different —\nthat’s a different exercise. I would just say , it’s very uncertain exactly what would happen to the\ndollar. Ther e has been a lot of discussion of that, and I think it ’s complicated and uncertain.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Yellen. Victoria Guida with Politico. My question is\nabout Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee wrote to you asking that the Fed\nnot put forward any regulations until a Vice Chair of Supervision is in place. So I have a couple\nof questions about that. One is, are you all pulling back at all on any regulations —maybe not all\nregulations, but, you know, maybe only going forward w ith ones that you see as more time\nsensitive? And during the hearing before that committee, you mentioned specifically the CCAR stress- test rule would have to come out sometime before that next cycle. Are there any other\ntime-sensitive regulations?\nCHAI R YELLEN. So at this point we don’ t have a lot of time -sensitive regulations.\nThere is nothing right now that we need to get out that ’s a significant rule. So we have a\nrelatively light regulatory agenda at this point. We recognize, of course, that we do have an obligation to write the rules that Congress, you know, dictates in laws that they pass , and so that\nis an ongoing obligation—obligation that we have. But our calendar is relatively light at this point.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Back\nhere.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Yes.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER . Some Fed critics have said it ’s too soon to raise\ninterest rates because wages haven ’t risen enough to justify a rate increase. What would you say\nto that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I don ’t—I would like to see wages increase and think there ’s\nsome scope for them to increase somewhat further. But our objectives are maximum employment and inflation , and we need to consider what path of rates is appropriate to foster\n\nthose objecti ves. Unfortunately, one of the things that ’s been holding down wage increases is\nvery slow productivity growth. And I think we are seeing some upward pressure as the labor\nmarket tightens. I take that as a signal that we ’re coming closer to our maximum employment\nobjectives. But productivity is —for those focusing on wage growth, productivity is an additional\nimportant factor."
