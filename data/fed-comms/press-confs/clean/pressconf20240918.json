  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated\nstate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of\nAugust. We’re committed to maintaining our economy ’s strength by supporting maximum\nemployment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nToday , the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy\nrestraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½  percentage point. This decision reflects our\ngrowing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the\nlabor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I\nwill have more to say about monetary policy after briefly revi ewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid\npace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data\npoint to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has\nremained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic\npace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising\nstrongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the\nstrong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median\nprojection of 2 percent over the next few years.\n\nIn the labor market, conditions have continued to cool. Payroll job gains averaged\n116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step -down from the pace seen earlier in\nthe year. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent. Nominal wage\ngrowth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad\nset of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before\nthe pandemic in 2019. The labor market is n ot a source of elevated inflationary pressures. The\nmedian projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4. 4 percent at the end of this year,\nfour-tenths higher than projected in June.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal\nof 2 percent. Estimates based on the c onsumer p rice index and other data indicate that total PCE\nprices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Longer -term inflation expectations\nappear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,\nbusinesses, and forecasters as well as measur es from financial markets. The median projection\nin the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. For much of the past three years,\ninflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight. Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. We are\nacutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power,\nespecially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.\n\nOur restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply\nand demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well\nanchored. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much\ncloser to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nAs inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation\nhave diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. We now see the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.\nIn light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today ’s meeting , the\nCommittee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to 4¾ percent to 5 percent. This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of\nthe economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we\nbegin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance. We are not on any preset course. We\nwill continue to make our decision s meeting by meeting.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At\nthe same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,\nthe Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant\n\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this\nyear and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. These median projections are lower than in June,\nconsistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks. These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum -employment and price -stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation\npersists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken\nunexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everyt hing we can to achieve our maximum -\nemployment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman , for taking our\nquestions. In July , you said you weren’ t necessarily thinking about a 50. Y ou didn’ t want to be\nspecific, but you said you weren’ t thinking about a 50. The inflation data last week came out a\nlittle firmer than expected . Retail was strong, third -quarter GDP running 3 percent . So what\n\nchanged that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it\nshows the F ed is more concerned about the labor market? And I guess, should we expect more\n50s in the months ahead? And based on what should we make that call? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [Laughter] Let me jump in. So,\nsince the last meeting —okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in. We’ve had the\ntwo employment reports, July and August . We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one\nthat came in during blackout . We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe —that not\nmaybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we ’re getting may be artificially high\nand will be revised down . You know that. We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data\ncollected in] the Beige Book. S o we took all of those , and we went into blackout . And we\nthought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that ’s, that’s how we made our decision. So that ’s one question. What\nwas the second and third?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. How do we make the —sorry, thank you, sir. How do we figure out\nin the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So a couple things . A good place to start is the —is the SEP,\nbut let me start with what I said, which was that we ’re going to be making decisions meeting by\nmeeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks. If you look at\nthe SEP, you’ ll, you’ll see that it ’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from\nwhere we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that ’s\nmore appropriate given where we are now and w here we expect to be. And that process will take\nplace over time. There ’s nothing in the —in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to\n\nget this done. This, this process evolves over time. Of course , that ’s a projection . That’s a\nbaseline projection. We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do\nwill depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that ’s appropriate . We can\ngo slower if that ’s appropriate. We can pause if that ’s appropriate. But that’ s, that’s what we are\ncontemplating. A gain, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where —what the\nCommittee is thinking today —what the individual members , rather, of the Committee are\nthinking today , assuming that their particular forecasts take —you know, are realized.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Hi . Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. The\nprojections show that the F ed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their\nestimate of long -run neutral by the end of next year. So does that suggest that you see rates as\nrestrictive for that entire period? Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you\nsaid you’ d like to avoid? Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short -run neutral as a little\nbit higher ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it would —the way I would really characterize it i s this : I\nthink people write down their estimate, individuals do. I think every single person on the\nCommittee, if you asked them , what ’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there ’s\na wide range where that could fall. So I think we don’ t know . There are model -based\napproaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But, realistically, we know it by its works. So that leaves us in a place where we’ ll\nbe—where we expect , in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we ’ll be\nlooking at the way the economy reacts to that . And that ’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the\nquestion that we ’re asking at every meeting, which is , is our policy stance the appropriate one?\n\nWe know —if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a\ntime when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent. Today , unemployment\nis up to 4.2 percent ; inflation ’s down to a few tenths above 2. So we know that it is time to\nrecalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and\non employment moving to a more sustainable level . So the balance of risks are now even. And\nthis is the beginning of that process I ment ioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of\nneutral, and we ’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time. What you have\nis our individual —accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. How close was this in terms\nof the decision? You do have the first dissent by a G overnor since 2005, I think . Was the weight\nclearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we had a good—a good discussion . You know, i f you go\nback, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’ t address the question of the size of the cut\nand left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout . And so there was a lot of\ndiscussion back and forth, good diversity of —excellent discussion today. I think there was also\nbroad support for the decision that the Committee voted on. So I would add, though, look at the\nSEP. All 19 of the participants wrote down mul tiple cuts this year. All 19. That’s a big change\nfrom June, right? Seven of the —seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the\n19 wrote down three or more cuts , and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts. So, you\nknow, there is a dissent , and there ’s a range of views , but there ’s actually a lot of common\nground as well.\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Follow -up to that . Now that this is in the books, can you give\nus some guidance as sort of a follow -up to Steve on the pacing here? Would you expect this to\nbe running every other meeting once we get into next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned. T here’s\nno sense that the Committee feels it ’s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this ,\nand that ’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence —confidence that inflation is , is coming down\ntoward 2 percent on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can , you know, make a\ngood, strong start. But —and I ’m very pleased that we did. To me , the logic of this, both from an\neconomic standpoint and also from a risk -management standpoint, was clear. But I think we ’re\ngoing to go carefully , meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for\ntaking our questions. You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the\nunemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there. Obviously, historically , when the\nunemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’ t typically\njust stop —it continues increasing. And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the\nlabor market stabilizing, sort of what’ s the mechanism there? And what do you see as the risks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, a nd our\nintention with our policy move today is to keep it there. You can say that about the whole\neconomy. The U.S. economy is in good shape. It ’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming\ndown, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there. That’s, that’s what we ’re\ndoing.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Sorry —Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, does today’ s\naction constitute a catch -up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,\nor is this larger -than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate\nsuch that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, multiple questions in there . So I would say we don’ t think\nwe’re behind . We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of\nour commitment not to get behind. So it’s, it’s a strong move. Sorry, your other question was?\nNICK TIMIRAOS. It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between\nthis meeting and the last meeting? Or is this about the level of the funds rate —the high nominal\nlevel of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you ’re trying to maintain equilibrium?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it ’s about —we come into this with a policy position that\nwas put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation\nand very low unemployment. We’ve been very patient about , about reducing the policy rate.\nWe’ve waited . Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.\nWe’ve waited , and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our\nconfidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 perc ent. So I think that is what enables\nus to take this , this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say ,\n“Oh, this is the new pace.” You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case . Of\ncourse , what happens will happen. S o, so, in the base case, what you see is —look at the SEP,\nyou see cuts moving along. T he sense of this is we’ re recalibrating policy down over time to a\nmore neutral level. And we ’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given\n\ndevelopments in the economy and the base case. The economy can develop in a way that would\ncause us to go faster or slower, but that ’s what the base case is.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet , in 2019, when you\ndid the mid -cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff. With a larger cut today, is\nthere any —should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “ end\nstate” on the balance sheet policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable. T hey\nhaven’ t come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As\nyou know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight R RP [facility].\nSo I think what that tells you is , we’re not thinking about , about stopping runoff because of this\nat all. We know that these two things can happen side by side . In a sense, they’ re both a form of\nnormalization , and so, for a time , you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting\nrates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Just following up\non Jeanna ’s question on rising unemployment . Is it your view that this is just a function of a\nnormalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too? And I guess, in direct follow -up to Jeanna, do you not —why should we not expect\na further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrict ive?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think what we ’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have\ncooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’ re still at a level—\nthe level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.\n\nSo you’ re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that. So what ’s driving it? Clearly, clearly\npayroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching. Many —\nBy many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a\nvery good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17. So the labor market bears\nclose—bears close watching , and we ’ll be giving it that. But ultimately, we think —we believe,\nwith an appropriate recalibration of our policy , that we can continue to see the economy growing,\nand that will support the labor market. In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic\nactivity data , retail sales data that we just got, second -quarter GDP —all of this indicates an\neconomy that is still growing at a solid pace. So that should also support the labor market over\ntime. So—but again, we ’re—it bears watching . And we ’re watching.\nCOLBY SMITH. And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to\nhappen, wouldn’ t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re—that ’s—you know, our plan, of course , has been to begin\nto recalibrate and we’re —as you know, we ’re not seeing rising claims, we ’re not seeing rising\nlayoffs, we ’re not seeing that , and we ’re not hearing that from companies that that ’s something\nthat’s getting ready to happen. So we ’re not waiting for that, because , you know, there is —there\nis thinking that the time to support the labor market is when —is when it’s strong and not when\nwe begin to see the layoffs. There ’s some lore on that. So that ’s the situation we ’re in. We have,\nin fact, begun the cutting cycle now , and we ’ll be watching —and that ’ll be one of the factors that\nwe consider. Of course , we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions\nmeeting by meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio. To follow up on\nthat, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?\nYou’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a\nhigher unemployment rate. Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style —\nrather than , as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going to be watching all of the data, right? So if —as I\nmentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by , by cutting faster. We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,\nthough. We are more— we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to\n2 percent, but , at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.\nSo—and policy , we think , is still restrictive , so that should still be happening.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I ’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ ll be to the labor market,\nsince you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant\namount of monetary easing to just maintain it.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, what I would say is , we don’ t think we need to see\nfurther loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent. But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as —take a step back, what have we\nbeen trying to achieve? We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability\nwithout the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.\nThat’s what we ’re trying to do. And I think you can t ake today’ s action as a sign of our strong\ncommitment to achieve that goal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell . Rachel S iegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You’re describing this view that you don’ t think you’ re behind when it\ncomes to the job market. Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be\nmost helpful in the discussions at this meeting? You’ve mentioned a couple , but would you be\nable to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job\nmarket now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So we ’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most\nimportant one probably . You’re at 4.2 percent. That’s, you know —I know it ’s higher than we\nwere used to seeing , numbers in the mid - and even below mid- 3s last year, but , if you look back\nover the sweep of the year s, that ’s, that’s a low . That’s a very healthy unemployment rate. And\nanything in the low 4s is, is a really —is a good labor market. So that ’s one thing. Participation\nis at high levels . It’s, you know —we ’ve had —we ’re right—adjusted for demographics for\naging, participation ’s at pretty high levels . That’s a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what\nwould be their —wage increases, rather , are still just a bit above where they would be over the\nvery longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they ’re very much coming down to\nwhat that sustainable level is. So we feel good about that. Vacancies over —per unemployed is\nback to what is still a very strong level . It’s not as high as it was. That number reached two to\none, two vacancies for every unemployed person. A s measured, it ’s now below —it’s around\none. But that ’s still—that ’s still a very good number, I would say. You know, quits have come\nback down to normal levels . I mean , I could go on and on. There are many, many employment\nindicators . What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn’ t the\nlevel ; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months , and, you\nknow, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the\n\ndownside risks to employment have increased . And, and because we have been patient and held\nour fire on cutting while , while inflation has come down, I think we ’re now in a very good\nposition to manage the risks to both of our goals.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And what do you expect to learn between now and November that\nwill help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, m ore data, the usual. Don ’t look for anything else. We’ll\nsee another labor report . We’ll see another jobs report . I think we get a —we might, actually —\nwe get two —we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think , or no, no, on the\nFriday before the meeting. So—and inflation data . We’ll get all this data . We’ll be watching .\nYou know, it’ s always a question of , look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications\nof that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and\nthink, what ’s the right thing to do? Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of\nour goals over time? So that ’s what it is , and that ’s what we ’ll be doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. We’ve only been\nrunning a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months. Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be —would you be content if we\nwere to kind of stick at that level? And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the\nlast couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather than job losses. Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor\nmarket cooling will have to come through job losses?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,\nright? So , if you’ re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’ re creating\n\n100,000 jobs, you’ re going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what ’s the trend\nunderlying the volatility of people coming into the country. We understand there ’s been quite an\ninflux across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that ’s, that’s, that’s allowed\nthe unemployment rate to rise . And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate , which is\nsomething we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what ’s happening on the supply side.\nOn the Beveridge c urve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all , but I think\neveryone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long\nway before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss. And yes, I mean, I think we are —it’s hard to know that —you can’ t know these things\nwith great precision, but certainly it appears that we ’re very close to that point, if not at it , so that\nfurther declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it’ s been —\nit’s been a great ride down . I mean , we’ve seen a lot of , of tightness come out of the labor\nmarket in that form without it resulting in lower employment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks , Chair Powell . Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.\nSo we ’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,\nmaybe under 4 percent . There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near -\nzero federal funds rate, and some think we ’re heading in that direction again. What’s the\nlikelihood that cheap money is now the norm?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is a question —and you mean after we get through all of this?\nIt’s just —great question that we just, we can only speculate about. Intuitively , most —many,\nmany people anyway, would say we ’re probably not going back to that era where there were\ntrillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates —long- term bonds trading at\n\nnegative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so —and it\nwas—people were issuing debt at negative rates. It seems that ’s so far away now . My own sense\nis that we ’re not going back to that. But, you know, honestly, we ’re going to find out. But , you\nknow, it feels —it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was\nback then. How high is it? I don’ t—I just don’ t think we know. It’ s—again, we only know it by\nits works.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will\nlikely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so , you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the F ed,\nand, you know, it’ s always the same. We’re always —we’re always going into this meeting, in\nparticular , and asking, what ’s the right thing to do for the people we serve? And we do that , and\nwe make a decision as a group , and then we announce it. And it ’s—that’s always what it is. I t’s\nnever about anything else. Nothing else is discussed , and I would also point out that the things\nthat we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag . So, nonetheless, this is\nwhat we do. Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And, if we\nget it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the\nmind , and, you know, it’ s something we all take very, very seriously. We don’ t put up any other\nfilters. I think if you start doing that, I don’ t know where you stop. And so we just don’ t do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Thank you, Chair Powell . I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News. My first\nquestion is , very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the\nAmerican people, with this unusually large rate cut?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I would just say that , you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,\nand, and our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is\ngrowing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape . So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we\ncurrently see in the U.S. economy. And we ’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,\nwhich has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control. We’re,\nwe’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.\nJO LING KENT. Just have a follow -up to that . Listening to you talk about inflation\nmoving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices?\nCHAIR POWELL. No , we’re not. So inflation, you know —what we say is we want\ninflation —the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. And, you\nknow, we ’re not really —we’re close, but we ’re not really at 2 percent. A nd I think we ’re going\nto want to see it be , you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we ’re\ncertainly not doing—we ’re not saying “ mission accomplished ” or anything like that. But I have\nto say , though, we ’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIV A. Hi. Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News. I just would love\nto know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we ’ve seen in housing\ninflation. You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?\nYeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. So housing inflation is the —is the one piece that is kind of dragging\na bit, if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which\n\nis to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’ re not rolling over —the leases that are\nrolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high. S o, you know, it’ s been\nslower than we expected. I think we now understand that it ’s going to take some time for those\nlower market rents to get into this. But , you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as\nmarket rents remain , you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time\nit’s taking now , several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals. So\nthat’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’ t think the outcome is in doubt again . As long\nas market rent s remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt. So I would say it ’s—the\nrest of the portfolio —or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.\nYou know, t hey’re all—they all have some volatility. We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I\nbelieve, and I believe that , ultimately , we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services\npiece, too.\nCATARINA SARAIV A. Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that , with\nstarting to cut rates , you could re -ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.\nWhat ’s the likelihood of that , and how would you react to that?\nCHAIR POWELL. The housing market, it ’s hard to—it ’s a game that —the housing\nmarket is in part frozen because of lock -in with low rates . People don’ t want to sell their home s.\nSo, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance. As rates\ncome down, people will start to move more , and that ’s probably beginning to happen already.\nBut remember, when that happens , you ’ve got a seller , but you’ ve also got a new buyer in many\ncases. So it ’s not , you know, obvious how much addi tional demand that would make. I mean ,\nthe real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough\nhousing. And so it ’s going to be challenging. It ’s hard to find —to zone lots that are in places\n\nwhere people want to live . It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and ,\nyou know, where are we going to get the supply? And this is not something that the Fed can , can\nreally fix. But I think , as we normalize rates, you ’ll see the housing market normalize . And, I\nmean , ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and\ngetting the housing cycle normalized, that ’s the best thing we can do for house holders . And then\nthe supply question will have t o be dealt with by the market and also by government.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Just following up on some of the\nlabor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and\nI’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too\nmuch comes from the fact that you’ re starting to act now and that ’s going to give people more\nroom to run versus just the labor market is strong. And then, also, if I could, following up on\nNick ’s question, do you see today ’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that\nyou didn’ t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall\neconomy. You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace . If you look at forecasters or\ntalk to companies, they’ ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year , too. So there ’s no\nsense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,\nbusiness people who are actually out there doing business. So I think, you know, I think our\nmove is timely . I do. And, as I said, you can —you can see our , our 50 basis point move as a\ncommitment to make sure that we don ’t fall behind.\nSo you’ re really asking about —your second question, you’ re asking about July. And I\nguess if you ask if we ’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut? We might\n\nwell have. We didn’ t make that decision , but we might well have. I think that ’s not —you know,\nthat doesn’ t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is , let’s look, you know —at\nthis meeting we’ re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,\nthe two CPI reports, one of which came , of course , during blackout, and all of the other things\nthat I mentioned . We’re looking at all of those things , and we ’re asking oursel ves, what ’s the\nright —what ’s the policy stance we need to move to ? We knew —it’s clear that we —clearly,\nliterally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’ s time to move. It’s just how big—how fast\ndo you go, and what do you think about the paths forward. So this decision we made today had\nbroad support on the Committee, and I ’ve discussed the path ahead.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC\nNews. Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement . How\nmuch more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Very hard for me to say. That’s—from our standpoint, I can ’t really\nspeak to mortgage rates. I will say that’ ll depend on how the economy evolves. Our intention ,\nthough, is —we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive . We think that it ’s time to\nbegin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’ s more neutral, rather than restrictive. We\nexpect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.\nAnd as —if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come\ndown as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs. We can ’t see—we can ’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to\nbe doing—going to be doing.\n\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. What ’s your message to households who are frustrated that\nhome prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high? What do you say to those\nhouseholds?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest —we had\na burst of inflation . Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and,\nwhen that happens , part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy\noff in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It’s not something that people experience as\npleasant, but , at the end , what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored . And a\ngood definition of price stability i s that people in their daily decisions, they’ re not thinking about\ninflation anymore. That’s where everyone wants to be , is back to what ’s inflation, you know?\nJust keep it low , keep it stable. We’re restoring that. S o what we ’re going through now really\nrestores—it will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody\nover a long period of time , just by virtue of the fact that they don ’t have to deal with inflation.\nSo that ’s what ’s been going on, and I think we ’ve made real progress. I completely —we don’ t\ntell people how to think about the economy, of course . And, of course , people are [still]\nexperiencing high prices , as opposed to high inflation. And we understand that ’s painful.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Hi, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com. I was wondering\nif you could go through —you said just at the beginning that , coming into the blackout , there was\nlike an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the F ed could move either 25 or 50. I would sort of\nargue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York F ed President\nJohn Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day. I mean , I sort of want to ask a seven -part question about this. But, I mean, could you talk—\n\nwould you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like , low odds of a\n50 point move like they were last Wednesday , you know, a fter the CPI number came out? It was\na really small probability of a 50 point cut. D oes that play in your consideration at all? Just talk\na little bit about that. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for\nthe economy at that time. That’s what we’ ll do. And that ’s what we did today.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. You’ve mentioned how closely you’ re watching the labor market, but you also noted\nthat payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions. Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate? And given the\nSEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be\nthe kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,\nincluding the payroll numbers. We’re not discarding those. I mean , we’ll certainly look at those,\nbut we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to. There isn ’t a bright line . You know, it will be —the unemployment rate ’s very important, of\ncourse, but there isn’ t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move\nthat would dictate one thing or another. We’ll look at—each meeting , we’ll look at all the data\non inflation, economic activity, and the labor market , and we ’ll make decisions about , is our\npolicy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals ? So I\ncan’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\n\nMATT EGAN. Thanks , Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. I know that you discussed\nearlier how the F ed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in. But , in general,\ncan you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in F ed\ndecisions on interest rates? Because that ’s something that former P resident Trump, who\nobviously appointed you, has previously suggested. And I know the F ed is designed to be\nindependent , but why? Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So countries that are —democracies around the world,\ncountries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central\nbanks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from\ndirect control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office. So that ’s the idea, is that —\nyou know, I think the data are clear that countrie s that have independent central banks, they get\nlower inflation . And so we ’re, we ’re not —we do our work to serve all Americans . We’re not\nserving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It’s just maximum\nemployment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that ’s how the other central\nbanks are set up, too. It ’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public\nand I hope —and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Kyle Campbell for American Banker. Thanks for taking the\nquestions, Chair Powell. A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask\nyou about. First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the\nchanges to the Base l III endgame. I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what\nthose changes should be, if those have support on the B oard in the broad way that you’ re looking\n\nfor, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach. And then\nyesterday, other banking regulators —\nCHAIR POWELL. You know what, hold the second question.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Okay . Sure.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll give you the second question. So the answer to your question\nis that, yes, those , those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with\nmy involvement, with the idea that we were going to re -propose, re -propose the changes that\nVice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them. So, yes, that is —that ’s happening\nwith my support.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Is there a date for that —\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s not a proposal , though, you understand. W e’re putting\nthem out for comment. W e’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes. We don’ t\nhave a —we don’t have a calendar date for that , and , as for the other agencies, you know, the idea\nis that we ’re all moving together , we’re not moving separately, so that —I don ’t know exactly\nwhere that is. But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this , again , out for comment,\nand then, you know, it’ ll—the comments will come back 60 days later , and we ’ll dive into them,\nand we ’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Right. And then, yesterday . there were merger reform finalizations\nfrom the other bank regulators . What does the F ed have to do to align itself on a merger ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair\nBarr. It ’s a good question, but I don ’t have that today. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer , for the last question.\n\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration\nstrength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even\nthough the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly\nbalanced. Given what you’ ve said , though, today, I ’m curious, are you more worried about the\njob market and growth than inflation? Are they not roughly balanced?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think— I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.\nSo if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation. W e had a historically tight labor\nmarket, historically tight. There was a severe labor shortage , so very hot labor market . And we\nhad inflation way above target. So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation. And we did for a while , and we kept at that, that the stance that we put\nin place 14 months ago was a stance that wa s focused on bringing down inflation. Part of\nbringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor\nmarket. You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity. So what that tells\nyou is , it’s time to change our stance. So we did that. The sense of the change in the stance is\nthat we ’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral. And today\nwas—I think we made a good strong start on that. I think it was the right decision, and I think it\nshould send a signal that we , you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome\nhere.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that\ncould tip it into recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t think so. I don’ t—there ’s—as I look—well, let me look at it\nthis way : I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a\n\nrecession —sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay? I don’ t see that. You see—you see growth at\na solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that ’s, that’s still at very\nsolid levels. So, so I don’ t really see that, no. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you."
