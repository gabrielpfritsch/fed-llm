As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC\n“reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percen t target range for the federal funds rate remains\nappropriate.” The Committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate,\nindicating that “the Committee j udges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance\nof monetary policy.” This new language does not represent a change in our policy intentions and\nis fully consistent with our previous guidance, wh ich stated that it likely will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal f unds rate for a considerable time after the end of\nour asset purchase program. But with that pr ogram having ended in October, and the economy\ncontinuing to make progress toward our objectives, the Committee judged that some\nmodification to our guidance is appr opriate at this time. I will ha ve more to say about our policy\ndecisions in a moment, but first let me review recent economic developments and the outlook.\nIn the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum\nemployment. The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly\n280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job gains averaged nearly\n230,000 per month. The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, three-tenths lower\nthan the latest reading availabl e at the time of the September FO MC meeting. Broader measures\nof labor market utilization have shown similar improvement, and the labor force participation\nrate has leveled out. As noted in the FOMC statement, “unde rutilization of labor resources\ncontinues to diminish.” Even so, there is r oom for further improvement, with too many people\nwho want jobs being unable to find them, too ma ny who are working part time but would prefer\n\nPage  full-time work, and too many who ha ve given up searching for a j ob but would likely do so if the\nlabor market were stronger.\nThe Committee continues to see sufficient und erlying strength in the economy to support\nongoing improvement in the labor market. Real GDP looks to have increased robustly in the\nthird quarter, reflecting solid consumption and investment spendi ng. Smoothing through the\nquarterly ups and downs earlier this year, real GDP expanded around 2½ percent over the four\nquarters ending in the third quarter, and the availa ble indicators suggest that economic growth is\nrunning at roughly that pace in the current quar ter. The Committee continues to expect a\nmoderate pace of growth going forward.\nInflation has continued to r un below the Committee’s 2 percen t objective, and the recent\nsizable declines in oil prices wi ll likely hold down overall inflation in the near term. But as the\neffects of these oil price declines and other transitory factors dissi pate and as resource utilization\ncontinues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.\nIn making this forecast, the Committee is mindf ul of the recent declines in market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensation. At this point, the Committee vi ews these movements as\nlikely to prove transitory, and survey-based measur es of longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained stable. That said, developments in this area obviously bear close watching.\nThis outlook is reflected in the individua l economic projections submitted in conjunction\nwith this meeting by the FOMC participants. As always, each participant’s projections are\nconditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy. The central tendency of the\nunemployment rate projections is slightly lowe r than in the September projections and now\nstands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line w ith its estimated longer-run normal\nlevel. Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declin ing a little further over\n\nPage  the course of 2016 and 2017. The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is\n2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections. Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth. Finally, although FOMC pa rticipants project inflation in the near term to be lower on\naccount of the decline in energy prices, they co ntinue to see inflation moving gradually back\ntoward 2 percent. The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next\nyear, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017.\nAs I noted earlier, the Committee “reaffirmed its view that the cu rrent 0 to ¼ percent\ntarget range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.” Regarding forward guidance for the\nfederal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain\nthe current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of our\nasset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s\n2 percent longer-run goal. Today’s statement, which indicates that “the Committee judges that it\ncan be patient in beginning to normalize the stan ce of monetary policy,” does not signify any\nchange in the Committee’s polic y intentions as set forth in its recent statements. As before, this\njudgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a\nwide range of information, includ ing measures of labor market c onditions, indicators of inflation\npressures and inflation expectations, a nd readings on financial developments.\nGiven that the Committee is not signaling a change in policy, why did we update our\nguidance? The reason is that, with the asse t purchase program having been wound down in\nOctober, it seemed less helpful to continue to communicate about the possible timing of our first\nrate increase with reference to an event that is re ceding into the past. Inst ead, we have shifted to\n\nPage  language that better reflects the Committee’s focus on the economi c conditions that would make\nliftoff appropriate. Employment is rising at a healthy rate and the U.S. economy is\nstrengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy. Of course,\ninflation has been running somewhat below our go al of 2 percent, but we project that gap to\nclose gradually over time. As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy\naccommodation. But, based on its current outlook, the Committee judges that it can be patient in\ndoing so. In particular, the Committee consider s it unlikely to begin the normalization process\nfor at least the next couple of meetings.\nThis assessment, of course, is completely data dependent. If incoming information\nindicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the\nCommittee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to\noccur sooner than curren tly anticipated. Convers ely, if progress proves sl ower than expected,\nthen increases in the target range are likel y to occur later than currently anticipated.\nOnce we begin to remove policy accommoda tion, it continues to be the Committee’s\nassessment that, “even after employment and in flation are near manda te-consistent levels,\neconomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below\nlevels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the\npaths for appropriate policy given by FOMC pa rticipants. Assuming that the economy evolves\nbroadly in line with participants’ expectations, almost all participants believe that it will be\nappropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015.\nThere are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part\nreflecting differences in participants’ expectatio ns for how the economy will evolve. By the time\n\nPage  of liftoff, participants expect to see some furt her decline in the unemplo yment rate and additional\nimprovement in labor market conditions. They also expect core inflat ion to be running near\ncurrent levels but foresee being reasonably confid ent in their expectation that inflation will move\nback toward our 2 percent longer-run inflation obj ective over time. Of course, as I previously\nemphasized, the timing of the initial rise in the fe deral funds rate target, as well as the path for\nthe target thereafter, are contingent on economic conditions.\nBy late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains\nmore than 1 percentage point below the longer-ru n value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most\nparticipants, even though the centr al tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly\nbelow its estimated longer-run value and the centr al tendency for inflation is close to our\n2 percent objective. FOMC part icipants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds\nrate running below its normal longe r-run level at that time—in part icular, the residual effects of\nthe financial crisis, which are likely to conti nue to constrain househol d spending and constrain\ncredit availability for some time. But as these f actors dissipate further, mo st participants expect\nthe federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017.\nFinally, the Committee will continue its polic y of reinvesting proceeds from maturing\nTreasury securities and principal payments fr om holdings of agency debt and MBS. The\nCommittee’s sizable holdings of longer-term secu rities should help maintain accommodative\nfinancial conditions and promote further pr ogress toward our objectives of maximum\nemployment and inflation of 2 percent.\nThank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions. JON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, a\nnumber of Fed officials have proj ected in the lead-up to this m eeting that the most likely timing\n\nPage  for liftoff was around the middle of next year. I wonder if you could clarify that. You said in\nyour statement that “patient” means not for at least two meetings. Your forecast that—the\nFOMC’s forecasts seem to be consistent with something like a middle-of-the-year liftoff. Can\nyou speak to that? And can you also speak to the downdraft we’re seeing in inflation now and,\nin particular, the market-based inflation expect ations and whether that gives the Committee any\nhesitance about proceeding towards liftoff in the months ahead?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I did say that the stat ement that the Committee can be patient\nshould be interpreted as meaning that it is unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least\nthe next couple of meetings. Now, that doesn’t point to any preset or predetermined time at\nwhich normalization is—will begin. There are a range of views on the Committee, and it will be\ndependent on how incoming data bear on the progress the ec onomy is making.\nFirst of all, I want to emphasize that no meeti ng is completely off the table, in the sense\nthat if we do see faster progress toward our obj ectives than we currently expect, then it is\npossible that the process of nor malization would occur sooner than we now an ticipate. And, of\ncourse, the converse is also true . So, at this point, we thi nk it unlikely that it will be\nappropriate—that we will see conditions for at leas t the next couple of mee tings that will make it\nappropriate—for us to decide to begin normalizat ion. A number of Committee participants have\nindicated that, in their view, conditions could be appropriate by the middle of next year, but there\nis no preset time. And there are a range of vi ews as to when the appropriate conditions will\nlikely fall in place. So that’s something we will be watching closely as the year unfolds.\nYou asked also, I think, about inflation. A nd, as I mentioned in my press statement,\nespecially with the downward pressures on inflat ion that we expect to see for a little while\nbecause of declining oil prices and falling import pr ices, we certainly expect headline inflation to\n\nPage  be under downward pressure for a while. And, as I mentioned, most participants do envision that\nconditions will be appropriate sometime during th is coming year to begin normalizing policy.\nAnd they do largely expect that inflation will be—core inflation will probably be running close to its current level. And headline inflation could ev en be lower. But what they will want to have\nis a feeling of reasonabl e confidence that when we start the process of normalizing policy, that it\nwill be moving up over time. And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve,\nhistory suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that’s likely to\noccur.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger wi th the Associated Press. Given the—\nwhat’s happening now with the transition with the Fed, there seems to be a pattern developing\nthat the market expects big ne ws to come when you have a press conference and no news to\ncome when you don’t have one. But is that a goo d expectation? And is there any thought to\nstarting to have a press c onference at every meeting?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would really like to di scourage that expectation. Every meeting\nthat we have is a live meeting at which th e Committee could make a policy decision. And we\nwill feel free to do so. So I would really like to strongly disc ourage the expectation that policy\nmoves can only occur when there’s a scheduled press conference. And we have long had in\nplace the ability to hold a press c onference call, rather than an in-person press conference. And\nwe did do so on a number of occasions in earlier years. So the Committee, clearly, would want\nto be able to explain its reasoning. As we begin the process of normalizing policy, every\nmeeting is live. And if we were to decide at a meeting to begin to normalize policy, I expect we\nwould hold a press conference call.\n\nPage  STEVE LIESMAN. Was there concern—S teve Liesman, CNBC—was there concern\nexpressed at the meeting that the signal comi ng from markets—and a variety of markets—lower\noil prices, lower yields around the world, was one of deflation, and that that risk was one that\nshould, perhaps, overshadow the concer n about inflation on the other side?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, thanks Steve. We’re very attentive to global developments and\ncertainly discuss them in the meeting. The very s ubstantial decline we have seen in oil prices is\none of the most important developments shaping th e global outlook. It will have different effects\nin different regions and could well have effects on financial markets, as we are seeing. I think\nthe judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S.\noutlook, that the decline we have seen in oil pri ces is likely to be, on net, a positive. It’s\nsomething that’s certainly good for families, for households. It’s putting more money in their\npockets. Having to spend less on gas and energy, a nd so, in that sense, it’s like a tax cut that\nboosts their spending power. The United Stat es remains—although our production of oil has\nincreased dramatically, we still remain a net importe r of oil. Of course there may be some offset\nin the form of reduced drilling activity, and possibly some change, some reduction in cap-ex\nplans in the drilling area. But, on balance, I w ould see these developments as a positive for the\nstandpoint of the U.S. economy.\nWith respect to deflation, we see downward pr essure on headline inflation from declining\nenergy prices. We certainly recognize that that is going to be pushing down headline inflation\nand may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation. But, at this point, although we indicated we’re monitoring inflation developmen ts carefully, we see these developments as\ntransitory. And the Committee continues to be lieve—especially with the improvement we’re\nseeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue—that inflation will move back up to our\n\nPage  2 percent objective over time. As I indicated, we will want to feel, I believe, that people will\nexpect to feel reasonably confident about th at when they—when the process of normalization\nbegins. But we do expect them to be transitory.\nROBIN HARDING.   Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Madame Chair, there’s a\nbig gap between the pace markets expect you to rais e interest rates and th e rate you’ve indicated\nin your “dot plot.” Are markets mis understanding your intentions? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So that’s difficult for me to say. What I want to say is that our\nobjective is to communicate as clearly as we pos sibly can about our plans and how we see the\neconomic environment unfolding. When the pa rticipants in the Committee fill out their\nprojections, they’re asked to give the path of the federal funds rate and of the various economic\nvariables that they consider most likely. They’re not asked to talk about all the different things\nthat could happen, recognizing there is uncertaint y, and the paths of the funds rate that they\nwould consider appropriate if t hose other alternatives were to happen. But other alternatives, I\nthink, are priced into the market. And one reason that the market prices may be different than\nthe Committee’s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast. They ma y also have a different set of expectations about\nhow the—about the economic outlook and how it’s lik ely to unfold. So I recognize that there are\nsignificant differences. I can’t tell you exactly wh at they’re due to. But what I do want to do is\ncommunicate as clearly as I can, on behalf of the Committee, how we think the economy’s likely\nto progress and how we would likel y set the federal funds rate over time if that forecast bears\nout.\nROBIN HARDING. It doesn’t make you uncomfortable, where markets are now?\n\nPage  CHAIR YELLEN. There are a number of different factors that are b earing on the path of\nmarket interest rates, I think, in cluding global economic developments . It is often the case that\nwhen oil prices move down and the dollar apprecia tes, that that tends to put downward pressure\non inflation compensation and on longer-term rates. We also have safe-haven flows that may be\naffecting longer-term Treasury yields. So I can’t tell you exactly what is driving market\ndevelopments. But what I can say is that we are trying to communicat e our thoughts as clearly\nas we can.\nSTEVEN MUFSON. Hi. Steve Mufson from the Washington Post . I was just hoping\nyou could go into a little more detail about the oil effect. Even though you see it as transitory,\ndoes that give you a little more room to keep rates low in the next few months? And if—\nalternately, if prices bounce bac k, what’s that going to do to your ability to change rates, and\nhow might you react to that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well I—I’d sa y, you know, that I think what we have seen since the\nmid-’80s is that, in an environment where in flation expectations ar e well anchored, that\nmovements in oil and commodity pr ices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the\ninflation outlook. There were many years in which we had unanticipated increa ses in oil prices,\nreally beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upwar d pressure on headline inflation and sometimes\neven spilled through into core, and, typicall y, the Committee looked through those impacts on\ninflation with the view that they would be transi tory. And I think experience bears out that they\nwere transitory. And I think that’s the Committee’s expectati on here. Inflation, even core\ninflation, has been running below our inflation objective. Movements in oil, you know, now\ndown and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation. But the\nCommittee, at this point, anticipates those impacts to be transitory. So as long as participants\n\nPage  feel reasonably confident that the inflation pr ojection is one where we expect to meet our\n2 percent objective ove r time, that’s what I thi nk how they’ll be looking at things as we decide\non the path for the funds rate.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times . Does “a couple”\nmean two? And when you talk about reasonab le confidence in infla tion expectations, can you\nelaborate a little bit a bout what it would take to give you re asonable confidence that inflation is\nheaded back to 2 percent?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So “a couple”—I believe th e dictionary probably says, “a couple”\nmeans two. So, “a couple” means tw o. And with respect to infl ation—our forecast for inflation\nand inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it’s important th at monetary policy be\nforward looking. The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to\nbase its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future. Theory is\nimportant, and theories that are consistent with historical evidence will be something that\ngoverns the thinking of many people around the table. Typically, we have seen that as long as\ninflation expectations are well anchored, that as the labor market recove rs, we’ll gradually see\nupward pressure on both wages and prices, and th at inflation will tend to move back toward\n2 percent. I think historically we have see n, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes,\nthat inflation does tend to gr adually rise over time. And as long—you know, I—just speaking\nfor myself, I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view\nand, you know, looking at the full range of data th at bear on whether or not that’s a reasonable\nview of how events will unfold. But it’s likely to be a decision that’s based on forecasts and\nconfidence in the forecast.\n\nPage  MICHAEL FLAHERTY. Michael Flaherty, Reuters News. Chair Yellen, a lot of\nattention has been focused on liftoff. But, I wonder, has the Committee discussed what happens\nafter that liftoff and what, you know, the rate path would be after you make the first move?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I think you raise a very important poin t because, although there is\na great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to ma tter in thinking about the stance\nof policy is what the entire path of interest ra tes will look like. And I re ally don’t have much for\nyou other than to say that they will be data de pendent—that, over time, the stance of policy will\nbe adjusted to try to keep the economy on a tr ack where we see contin uing progress toward\nachieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability. There’s—you know, the\nfederal funds rate has been sitting in the 0 to ¼ percent range now for six years. This is—and we\nhave a very large balance sheet. We are pr oviding a very highly accommodative monetary\npolicy. And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary polic y, when that becomes\nappropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will stil l be very accommodative\nfor a long time. And as we begin to normalize policy, we will be looking at unfolding economic\ndevelopments. And as the economy strengthen s, and we come clos er to achieving our\nobjectives, I think it’s very likely that we w ill, you know, progress on the path of normalizing\npolicy. But I can’t tell you, specifically, other th an saying it will depend on progress, and moves\nwill be data dependent. I can’t say much more than that.\nGREG IP. Chair Yellen, the Committee’ s projections show unemployment running\nbelow your own views on where full em ployment should be for the next several years. Does that\nreflect a desire on the part of the Committee th at the economy run somewhat above potential for\na while? And, if so, can you ela borate on why it wants that and what purpose it achieves? And,\nrelated to the question that Jon Hilsenrath aske d earlier, you’ve called the decline in inflation—\n\nPage  and market-based measures of inflation expectati ons—transitory. But this decline has been very\npronounced in the five-year-forward range. So we ’re talking about expect ations that inflation\nmany years from now will be below target. And some market participants see that as evidence of\ndeclining credibility in the Committee’s long-ter m objective. Why do you still view that as\ntransitory?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So you—your fi rst question is: Why is it that the Committee sees\nunemployment as declining sligh tly below its estimate of the longer-run natura l rate? And, I\nthink, in part, the reason for that is that in flation is running below our objective, and the\nCommittee wants to see inflation move back towa rd our objective over time . And a short period\nof a very slight undershoot of unemployment below th e natural rate will facili tate a slightly faster\nreturn of inflation to our object ive. It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation\nwhere there is great uncertainty about exactly what constitutes maximum employment or a\nlonger-run normal rate of unemployment. We also do see the different measures of slack in the\nlabor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is. The standard\nunemployment rate, for quite some time now, has b een signaling a little bit less slack in the labor\nmarket than measures that are somewhat broade r that, for example, include the unusually large\nnumber of people who were part-time employed but would prefer full-time jobs. And the portion\nof the decline we’ve seen in la bor force participation, that look s like it would disa ppear in a—or\nbe eroded in a stronger economy. And so it may be that with a very small undershoot of this\nlonger-run normal level of the unemployment ra te, as measured by the standard unemployment\nrate, we’ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack. But it’s important to\npoint out that the Committee is not anticipating an ove rshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nPage   Oh, and longer-dated expectations. Well, wh at I would say, we refer to this in the\nstatement as “inflation compensation” rather than “inflation expectations.” The gap between the\nnominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for exam ple, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation\ncompensation. And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you’ve said, have al so declined. That\ncould reflect a change in inflati on expectations, bu t it could also reflect ch anges in assessment of\ninflation risks. The risk prem ium that’s necessary to compen sate for inflation, that might\nespecially have fallen if the proba bilities attached to very high in flation have come down. And it\ncan also reflect liquidity effects in markets. And, for example, it’s sometimes the case that—\nwhen there is a flight to safety, that flight te nds to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and\ncould also serve to compress that spread. So I th ink the jury is out about exactly how to interpret\nthat downward move in inflation compensation. And we indicated that we are monitoring\ninflation developments carefully.\nPETER COOK. Madame Chair, Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television. I want to follow\nup, if I could, on firming going forward, on the nor malization once liftoff takes place. I know\nyou said this is going to be data dependent. Does that suggest to markets, to those watching, that\nthe measured pace we’ve seen in a previous tighten ing cycle, those quarter- point increments, that\nthat’s not something markets shoul d expect? And what’s your ow n takeaway from how effective\nthat measured pace was back in th at previous tightening cycle?\nAnd if I could follow up just separately on the dissents at this meeti ng. There were three\ndissents, a notable number, certainly. What doe s that suggest about the debate around the table\nand your ability to forge consensus going forwar d? Are you disappointed with the number of\ndissents?\n\nPage  CHAIR YELLEN. So let me start with the number of dissents. There is a wide range of\nopinion in the Committee. I think it ’s appropriate for people to be able to express their views.\nAnd, in a sense, you see dissents on both sides. I think the statement does a good job of\nreflecting what the majority of the Committee th inks is appropriate policy. So at—you know, at\na time like this, where we are making consequential d ecisions, I think it’s ve ry reasonable to see\ndivergences of opinion. And just remi nd me, what was the other—about the—\nPETER COOK. Measured pace. CHAIR YELLEN. —measured pace. There certainly has been no, you know, decision\non the part of the Committee to move at a meas ured pace or to use language like that. I think\nquite a few people, looking back on the use of th at language in the—I can’t remember if it was\n12 or 16 meetings, where there were 25 basis point moves. We’d probably not like to repeat a\nsequence in which there was a measured pace and 25 basis point moves at every meeting. So I\ncertainly don’t want to encourage you to thi nk that there will be a repeat of that.\nMany members of the Committee, participants, ha ve said that they think policy should be\nbased on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, wh ich tends to be variable over\ntime, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent. We have continued to provide\nguidance, the same guidance that we have for so me time, that says the Committee “anticipates\nthat, even after employment and inflation ar e near mandate-consistent levels, economic\nconditions may, for some time, warrant keeping th e target federal funds rate below levels the\nCommittee views as normal in the longer run.”\nI know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in eff ect, that the Committee believes that the\neconomic conditions that have made recovery di fficult, we’re getting beyond them. They are\noptimistic that those conditions will lift. They see the longer-run normal level of interest rates as\n\nPage  around 3¾ percent. So there’s no view in the Co mmittee that there is secular stagnation in the\nsense that we won’t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates. But\nthey have said, it’ll, you know , the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of\nmonetary policy accommodation; we expect to be able to normalize policy. But, until those\nconditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, mone tary policy will need to stay\naccommodative. So, in that sense, perhaps that ’s equivalent to saying that the path of\nnormalization is anticipated to be relatively gradua l. But, again, the path of rates will depend on\nhow economic conditions actually evolve, and that ’s nothing more than an expectation on the\npart of the Committee.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Pedro da Costa with Do w Jones Newswires. Enough about rates.\nI want to ask you about the New York Fed. The Ne w York Fed’s been in the news a lot lately.\nPresident Dudley was invited to Congress to testify about conflicts of interest there. You had\nthings like the Segarra tapes, the Beim report, and, most recently, the revelation that a former\nNew York Fed official was exchanging informa tion with someone at Goldman Sachs who was\nalso—had New York Fed connections. I just w onder—and also there were scandals during the\ncrisis related to Stephen Friedman regarding the New York Fed, and his purchase of Goldman\nSachs stock. Do you see the New York Fed as a black mark on the Fed system because of these recurring scandals? Have you talked to Bill Dudley about reforming the image of that particular\nregional Fed? And do you think a person that ha s—that spent 21 years of his career at Goldman\nSachs is in a position to regain public cr edibility about conf licts of interest?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, let me say that I th ink it’s very important for the Federal\nReserve System to have confidence in the quality of its supervision. And I do have a good deal\nof confidence in the quality of our supervision program, fo r the banking organizations we\n\nPage  supervise in general, and that also applies to the largest banking organizations. We rely on\nexaminers who are in the field and at the Re serve Banks to be provi ding information about\nwhat’s happening in those organizations. But that information feeds into a process in which it is\nnot individuals at any single Reserve Bank. But, at the Board, it’s a Board-led process, and it\ninvolves senior officials at a number of different Reserve Banks. It’s also a multidisciplinary\nprocess that involves not only pe ople from supervision, but those from markets, from economic\nresearch. Experts who focus on financial stability all come together to evaluate the information\nthat they have and to assign supe rvisory ratings and decide on th e appropriate program for all of\nthose large institutions. We’ve strengthened th e process of supervision enormously since the\ncrisis, and I feel a very good sense of confidence in how we’re carrying that out.\nNow, it is important to make sure that we ha ve fed into this process all the information\nthat’s relevant to making the right decisions. An d when there are individuals who are examiners,\nwho may disagree with others in their team about how to interpre t what’s going on at a particular\ninstitution, it’s important that ther e be channels by which they can make sure that disagreements\nare fed up to the highest levels. This is tr ue throughout the work we do. We do economic\nforecasting, and our—the FOMC receives informati on to help us make decisions, but obviously\nthere are disagreements about—among economists a bout how to interpret developments. It’s\nalso important for us there to make sure we unders tand alternative views. So this is important in\nsupervision. We’ve announced that the Board has undertaken a review of whether or not there\nare appropriate mechanisms in place in all of th e Reserve Banks that individuals who disagree\nwith decisions can make their own views known and feed into the process, and we’ve also asked\nour inspector general to look into that.\n\nPage  JEFF KEARNS. Thank you. Jeff K earns from Bloomberg News. I’d also like to get off\nmonetary policy and ask you a bout the Federal Reserve’s re lationship with Congress.\nSpecifically, how worried are you about legislati on that has been proposed, and may be proposed\nagain in the next Congress, th at would reduce Fed independence? Would you see yourself trying\nto fight back? Or would you see yourself trying to go to Congress to work with them to do more\nwith transparency or something else to reduce their co ncerns without making them law? And, if\nthere were bills sent to the White House, would you talk to the President about vetoing them? Or\ndo you have any confidence that he would veto b ills that would reduce the Fed’s independence?\nThanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us important tasks in\nmonetary policy and in other role s that we perform, and the Fede ral Reserve is highly focused on\nattempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy.\nIt’s our dual mandate to promote maximum empl oyment and price stability, and that’s what\nwe’re working on.\nYou know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about\nmonetary policy that it regards as in the best longer-run interest s of the economy, free of short-\nrun political interference, is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy. And I\nthink that history shows, not onl y in the United States but arou nd the world, that central bank\nindependence promotes better economic performan ce. So I do think central bank independence\nis very important, and that it’s important to make sure that we can make the decisions we think\nare best, free of short-run political inte rference with respect to monetary policy.\nWe should be accountable, and we are accountable to Congress in explaining what we do.\nI believe strongly in transparency, and I believ e strongly that we shoul d communicate as clearly\n\nPage  what we are doing and the rationale for doing it , and I am very open to looking for ways\nourselves to improve our communications and tr ansparency, and working with Congress to do\nthat. But I would be very concerned about ac tions. Back in 1978, Congr ess explicitly passed\nlegislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking—\nnamely, policy audits. I certainly hope that will continue, and I will try to forcefully make the\ncase for why that’s important.\nJEFF KEARNS. Would it veto? CHAIR YELLEN. I cannot speak for the White House. I wouldn’t attempt to do that.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes of Fox Busine ss, ma’am. And also, I’ll stay off of\ninterest rates. And first, I want to wish you happy holidays.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. PETER BARNES. And, second, I want to ask you about the Russian economy. Did that\ncome up in the meeting in your discussion a bout the global economic developments? As you\nknow, there’s a lot of con cern that with the drop in oil pric es, the Russian economy could be in\nsome trouble. Russia owes a lot of money to U.S. and foreign banks and Russian companies. Is\nthere any concern about default? Any concern about possible contag ion? And, if so, has the Fed\ntaken any steps to prepare for that? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, we certainly did review global economic developments,\nincluding developments in the Russian economy. Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the\ndecline in oil prices, and the ru ble has depreciated enormously in value, and this is posing a\nseries of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy.\nOf course we discussed what the potential spi llovers are to the United States, which could\noccur both through trade and financia l linkages. But these linkages ar e actually relatively small.\n\nPage  Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. trade volume, and U.S. banks’ exposure to\nRussian residents is really quite small in terms of—relative to their capit al. In terms of the\nportfolios of U.S. residents, there are Russian securities, but th ey are—they account for a very\nsmall share. So I expect that the linkages back to the spillovers to the United States, both\nthrough trade and financial channels, would be sm all. Europe, of course, is somewhat more\nexposed to Russia, both because Russia is an impor tant supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe\nand the financial linkages are somewhat greater. But, in the case of the United States, I see the\nspillovers relative—it is pret ty small. But we’re obviously watching that closely.\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from Ma rketWatch. Also, happy holidays.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Same to you. GREG ROBB. There’s a contag ion risk to the—from low oil prices that people are\ntalking about in the markets. What does it mean to the banks that have lent, you know, into the\noil patch with the low oil prices? And I guess, you know, your warnings about leveraged\nloans—you have made warnings over the past y ear about leveraged lending. Are you worried\nthat they haven’t be en heeded? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, I mean, there is some—you ’re talking about in the United States\nexposure? I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield\nbonds, where there’s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or a decline in their\nearnings, and we have seen some increase in spr eads on high-yield bonds more generally. I think\nfor the banking system, as a whole, the exposure to oil—I’m not aware of significant issues\nthere. This is the kind of thing that is part of risk management for banking organizations and the\nkind of thing they look at in stre ss tests. But the movements in oil prices have been very large\nand undoubtedly unexpected.\n\nPage  We—in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by\nmovements in oil prices, leverage in the financ ial system, in general, is way down from the\nlevels before the crisis. So it’s not a major con cern that there are levere d entities that would be\nbadly affected by this, but we’ll have to watch carefully. There have be en large and unexpected\nmovements in oil prices.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Good after noon, Chair Yellen. Steve Beckner of MNI. I will go\nback to interest rates, if you don’t mind. Actual ly, it’s a question about balance sheet effects on\nthe overall appropriate le vel of monetary policy. In reaffirming the reinvestment policy, the\nFOMC says, once again, that this will help maintain accommodative financial conditions. In the\npast, it’s said that the large portfolio of securities will exer t a downward effect on long-term\ninterest rates. As you look forward to raising sh ort-term rates, to what extent does the FOMC\nneed to take into account this sort of resi dual, accommodative effect of maintaining a large\nbalance sheet?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I agree, and that’s why we stated that we typically think of the\nmonetary policy impact of our a sset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold\non our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we ’re reminding the public that we\ncontinue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in\nlonger-term yields. We made clear when we—or tried to make clear—when we issued our\nnormalization principles in September that we inte nd to use changes in our target for the federal\nfunds rate as the main tool that we will actively use to adjust financial conditions. Rather than\nactively planning to sell the assets that we’v e put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we\nbegin raising our targets for s hort-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial\nconditions, we’re likely to reduc e or cease reinvestment and gra dually run down the stock of our\n\nPage  assets. But our active tool for adjusting monetary —the stance of monetary policy so that it is\nappropriate for the economic needs for the countr y, that will be done through adjusting our short-\nterm target range for the federal funds rate.\nKEVIN HALL. Kevin Hall with McClatc hy Newspapers. I can’t believe nobody’s\nasked you the most important question, about what ’s going on with your San Francisco 49ers,\nsince everybody’s already wi shed you a happy holiday.\nCan you talk a little bit about housing? Few things are more important to Americans in\ntheir wealth creation than housing. You’ve, in your statement, not ed that it continues to be a\ndrag. Mr. Dudley has—was actually relatively upbeat in his foreca st. I don’t know if that’s a\nview shared on the Committee. What do you thi nk is holding housing back? What can Congress\ndo? What will you tell Congress in the coming year? And more—and a clarification on the\nDudley question from earlier. You didn’t mentio n him by name in your being pleased by quality\nof supervision. Are you pleased with Mr. Dudley’s handling of the events?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me start with that . I have great conf idence in President\nDudley. He’s done a fine job in running the New York Fed, and I want to be very clear that I\nhave great confidence in him. He’s a distinguished public serv ant, and he has worked very hard\nin the aftermath of the crisis to make sure that the New York Fed is doing all that it needs to do\nto contribute to the work that we do both in fina ncial stability and in supe rvision. And let’s see,\nthe other question that you asked was about—\nKEVIN HALL. Housing. CHAIR YELLEN. —about housing. So, you know , I’ve been surprised that housing\nhasn’t recovered more robustly than it has. In part, I think it refl ects very tight credit—\ncontinuing tight credit conditions for any borrower that doesn’t ha ve really pristine credit, you\n\nPage  know, credit ratings, and my hope is that that situation will ease over time. In addition,\nhousehold formation has been very depressed, and my expectation is that , as the labor market\ncontinues to improve and households feel better about their financial condition, that we will see\nhousehold formation pick up and a somewhat str onger recovery than we’ve seen thus far in\nhousing."
