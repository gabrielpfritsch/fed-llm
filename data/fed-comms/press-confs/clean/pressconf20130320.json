  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two- day meeting earlier today. As\nalways, my colleagues and I review ed recent economic and financial developments and\ndiscuss ed the economic outlook. The data since our January meeting have been generally\nconsistent with our expectation that the fourth -quarter pause in the recovery w ould prove\ntemporary and that moderate economic growth w ould resume. Spending by households and\nbusinesses has continued to expand, and the housing sector has seen further gains . The jobs\nmarket has also shown signs of improvement over the past six month s or so : Private payrolls are\ngrowing more quickly , total hours of work have increased, the rate of filings of new claims for\nunemployment insurance has fallen , and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down.\nHowever, at 7.7 percent, t he unemployme nt rate remains elevated. The Committee also remains\nconcerned that restrictive fiscal policies may slow economic growth and job creation in coming\nmonths.\nWe continue to monitor the recent increase s in gasoline prices, which appear to be due\nmostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance. Apart from temporary\nvariations in energy prices, i nflation is running somewhat below the Committee’s longer -run\nobjective of 2 percent . Importantly , longer -term inflation expectations remain stable . Overall,\nstill-high unemployment , in combination with relatively low inflation , underscores the need for\npolicies that will support progress toward s maximum employment in a context of price stabi lity.\nIn conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the\n7 Board m embers and 12 Reserve Bank p residents —submitted individual economic projections .\n\nmonetary policy. To summarize, the participants’ projections for economic growth ha ve a\ncentral tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent in 2015. T he central\ntendency of their projections of the unempl oyment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.3 to\n7.5 percent , declining to 6.0 to 6.5 percent in the quarter of 2015. M ost participants see\ninflation gradually increasing toward the Committee’s longer -run target; the central tendency of\ntheir projections for inflation is 1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.\nAs you already know from the policy statement, we are continuing the asset purchase\nprogram first announced in September . This decision was supported by our review at the\nmeeting of the likely efficacy, costs, and risks of additional purchases. Let me bri efly summarize\nthe cost –benefit analysis supporting our decision.\nAlthough estimates of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are\nnecessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases —by putting downward\npressure on longer -term interest rates, including mortgage rates —continue to provide meaningful\nsupport to economic growth and job creation. However, most also agreed that this monetary tool\nwould likely not be able on its own t o fully offset major economic headwinds, such as those that\nmight arise from significant near -term fiscal restraint or from a sharp increase in global financial\nstresses .\nWe also had a tho rough discussion of possible costs and risks of continued expansion of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The risks include possible adverse implications of\nadditional purchases for the functioning of securities markets, and the potential effects —under\nvarious scenarios —of a larger balance sheet on the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its asset\nholdings and, hence, on its remittances to the Treasury. The C ommittee also considered possible\n\nparticipants to take on excessive risk in a “reach for yield .” In the Committee’s view, these costs\nremain manageable but will continu e to be monitor ed, and we will take them into appropriate\naccount as we determine the size, pace, and composition of our asset purchases.\nAs for today, our policy decision had two main elements. First , the Committee decided\nto continue purchasing additional agency mortgage -backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per\nmonth and longer -term Tr easury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. It bears\nemphasizing that the Committee has described this pr ogram in terms of a monthly pace of\npurchases, rather than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tie d the evolution of the\nprogra m to economic criteria—specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in\nthe outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. Within this framework , the\nCommittee could vary the pace of purchases as progress is made toward i ts economic o bjectives\nor if its assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes . At this meeting , the\nCommittee judged that no adjustment was warranted.\nSecond , the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and\nreaffirmed its expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain\nappropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic\nrecovery strengthens . In particular, we anticipate that this exceptiona lly low range for the funds\nrate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage\npoint above the Committee’s longer -run infl ation goal of 2 percent, and longer -term inflation\nexpectations continue to be well anchored .\n\nforward guidance are thresholds, not triggers. Crossing one or more of these thresholds will not\nlead automatically to an increase in rates. Rather, the Committee will assess at that time whether\nthe outlook just ifies raising its target for the federal funds rate. This guidance will help market\nparticipants assess how th e Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is likely to respond to economic\ndevelopments, but its broader purpose is to assure households and businesses that monetary\npolicy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job\ncreation picks up. In their individual projections, 14 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first\nincrease in the target for the federal funds rate as occurring in 2015 or 2016.\nLet me comment briefly on how the two main pieces of our policy accommodation—\nasset purchases and guidance about future changes in the federal funds rate —fit together. The\npurpose of the asset purchases is to increase the economy’s near -term momentum, with the goal\nof improving the outlook for the labor market and helping to promot e a self -sustaining recovery\nwith price stability . The forward rate guidance, in turn, provides information about when the\nCommittee will begin consider ing the removal of policy accommodation through increases in the\ntarget for the federal funds rate. Importantly, the Committee expects a considerable interval to\npass between the time when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset\npurchases and the time when it will be appropriate to begin removing accommodation by moving\nthe federal fund s rate target toward more normal levels. As always, in deciding on the appropriate\nstance of policy, t he Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals\nof maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.\nIn sum, the Committee anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household\nand business spending and a strengthening housing sector. T he labor market has shown signs of\n\nexpected to remain low , and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive. In light of its\noutlook, and following a review of the efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, the\nCommittee today reaffirmed its asset purchase program and its federal funds g uidance.\nThank you very much . I would be glad to take your questions.\nYLAN MUI. Hi. Ylan Mui, Washington Post . My question is around QE. Obviously,\nwe’ve seen some of your colleagues give more -specific criteria, give some color around what\nthey’re looking for before they would consider exiting from QE. Can you give us any additional\ncolor on what you’ re looking for specifically in terms of substantial improvement in the labor\nmarket? And does the fact that there aren ’t thresholds associated with QE say anything about the\nlevel of disagreement among the C ommittee members over what that exit should look like?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, to take your second question first , the lack of\nthresholds comes from the complexity of the problem. On the one hand, we have benefits, which\nare associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects o n financial stability, which are hard to quantify\nand which people have different vie ws about. So , to this point, we ’ve not been able to give\nquantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target. We ’re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward. In\nparticula r, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the\nflow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we’re providing given the outlook for the labor market.\nIn terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we ’ve not given\nquantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds. I would say that we ’ll be looking for sustained\n\nunemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit\nrates, wage rates, and so on. We ’ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of\nindicators , and in a way that ’s taking place throughout the economy. And since we ’re looking at\nthe outlook—we ’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market —\nwe’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there ’s sufficient\nmomentum in the economy to pr ovide demand for labor going forward. So that will allow us to\nlook through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short- term shocks or\nproblems.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, to follow\nup on that last point, what —you referred to the possibility of varying purchases , the rates of\npurchases per month. W hat’s the difference in the conditions that would induce you to do that ,\nas opposed to the substantial improvements in the labor market that would induce you to stop the program altogether? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that\nit’s all or nothing. We maintain full spe ed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you\nknow, we stop. That would be , I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate.\nWe think it makes more sense to have our policy variable , which is the rate of flow of purchases ,\nrespond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook. So, as we make\nprogress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly. Now, we won ’t do that every meeting ; we won ’t do that\nfrequently . But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a meaningful\nway, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation\n\nprogress —how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments.\nROBIN HARDING. Could you define “ progress towards ” at all , how you deal with that?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by\n“substantial improvement,” it’s a broad -based improvement in a range of indicators as well as\nimprovement in output and labor demand. So, as we move —we see partial improvements, see\nmodest improvement , as we see a per iod in which the labor market is doing better, and we have\nreason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point. But it\nworks in both directions . If, subsequently , the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to\nget worse, we could, of course , bring back accommodation back to the previous level.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman from CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I have to keep coming\nback to this issue of adjusting the flow rate . Are we near that time right now? And how can the\nmarkets calibrate the number to changes in economic i mprovement ? For example, let ’s say ,\ntheoretically , we did 236,000 jobs in a month, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percent .\nWould that be sufficient to begin to adjust the purchas es downward? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, that’ s going to be obviously a decision that the\nCommittee has to make , and we will —at each meeting, we’ ll look at progress that’s been made\nsince the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to dete rmine whether there ’s been a sufficient\nchange to warrant a change in our policy stance. Internally, we ’ll use models and other\nindicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow. But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior , to let\nthem see how we respond to changes in the outlook. A nd that way there will be a better ability, I\n\nphasing -out of the program.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Are we near that level now?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That ’s an issue for —obviously, there has been\nimprovement , let me say that. We ’ve seen improvement in the last four or five months. The last\nfive months, for example, we ’ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector .\nUnemployment rate has come down four -tenths since September. Unemployment claims,\ninsurance claims are at the lowest level they ’ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing\nimprovement. I think one thing we would need is to make sure that this is not a temporary\nimprovement. So , we’ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple\nof months, and then things weakened again. So , I think an important criterion would be not just\nthe improvement that we ’ve seen, but is it going to be sustained for a number of months?\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Pedro da Costa from Reuters. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask you\nabout Cyprus a little bit, because you guys removed the reference in the statement referring to\neasing financial conditions , suggesting that you are alert to these new ri sks that seem to have\nemerged. Doesn ’t the fact that a country as small as Cyprus can set off such global\nreverberations suggest that the financial system is perhaps a lot more fragile than the Fed stress test suggest s? And then, separately, you discount ed the estimate of the “ too big to fail” subsidy\nthat Elizabeth Warren threw at you during the Senate hearing a couple weeks ago. I was\nwondering, does the Fed have its own estimate of what that subsidy is, and could you tell us what it is, if that’ s the case?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first, on the reverberations, it ’s a difficult situation in\nCyprus. You ’ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of the size of the\n\ndifficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues. And\nyou’ve seen that there ’s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they ’re going to meet\nthe demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue. So, there are a lot of uncertainties\nand difficulties , and there ’s questions about how —the way Cyprus is treated , what implications\nthat might have for other countries and the like. So, it does have some consequence . But , having\nsaid that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today , and I don ’t think that the\nimpact has been enormous. I mean , I think it ’s something we ’re paying attention to. We hope\nthat the Europeans will come up with an efficient and equitable solution. We are monitoring very carefully, but , at this point, we ’re not seeing a major risk to the U .S. financial system or the\nU.S. economy.\nOn the benefits of being too big to fail, no, we don ’t have an estimate. It’s pretty difficult\nto control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy. I think there is some\nevidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institution s will fail. You see, for example, spreads in the credit default\nswaps that indicate some probabi lity of failure. You see some discrimination among different\ninstitutions according to the bond market —interest rates that they get charged , and so on. So\nthere is some evidence of market discrimination.\nThat being said, I certainly never meant to say to Senator Warren —and I share her\nconcern about too- big-to-fail, I think it ’s a major issue —I never meant to imply that the problem\nwas solved and gone. It is n ot solved and gone ; it’s still here, but there ’s a lot of work in train.\nWe’re putting in the Basel capital standards. We’ re putting in the orderly liquidation authority\nfrom Dodd–Frank . We ’re working with our international partners. And I hope that we’ll make\n\nneeds to be addressed if at all possible.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman , I’d\nlike to change the sub ject a little. Your predecessor served as Fed Chairman for 19 years. By\ncontrast, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have 8 -year term limits on—for\ntheir top people. I wanted to ask you two questions related to that. First, as a matter o f\ngovernance, do you think 8 years is the right amount of time for a central bank leader to serve , or\nshould it be less or more , or undefined? And , more specifically, as it regards to you, your term is\n10 years from completion . How are you thinking about what you will be doing next year after\nyour term is completed?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, on the latter question, I don ’t have anything for you.\nI’ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal and other publications if I come to some\ndecision or som e developments in that front.\nIn terms of term limits, I don ’t have a strong view on that. Different countries use\ndifferent approaches. Of course, the P resident always has the option to reappoint or not\nreappoint Fed Chairm en, and the Senate always ha s the option of confirming or not conf irming.\nSo, in that respect, term limits are redundant. And , indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed\nChairman , that would be , I think, the only office in the federal government besides P resident and\nVice P resident that would have that restriction.\nBut that being said, again, I don ’t view this as a major issue , nor have I seen it actively\ndiscussed in, I think, in the Hill . Perhaps I missed it. But I don ’t have a strong view about that.\nMy 10- year term , of course , is not as Chairman. My 10- year remaining term is as a G overnor , so\nthat’s not relevant , really , to the question that you asked about.\n\nto asset purchases. You ’ve sp oken a lot about the power of forward guidance, the power of clear\ncommunication. I understand that it ’s a complicated issue, but why would you leave on the table\nthe additional power of saying to markets, “W e’re going to keep doing this for a while ”? And,\nseparately, there ’s been a lot of conversation about the risks associated with quantitative easing.\nI wonder if you could tell us , when is the last time you spoke with someone who is unemployed?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Pretty recently . I have a relative that is unemployed . But I\ncome from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession. Last time\nI was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent. I think it ’s better now. The home that\nI was raised in had just been for eclosed upon when I was visiting there. I have great concern\nabout the unemployed both for their own sake , but also because the loss of skills, the loss of\nlabor force attachment is bad for our whole economy. It reduces tax revenues . It reduces\nproducti vity. So I think it ’s very, very important that we act to address unemployment , and I\nthink the Federal Reserve— I think most people would agree —the Federal Reserve has been\nfairly active in that regard.\nIn terms of costs, there are a number of different costs , and I mentioned some of them in\nmy remarks. I think one that has recently been discussed—Governor Stein brought it up in a\nspeech —is the issue of financial stability. Clearly, financial in stability , if it were allowed to be\nsufficiently serious , would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs , and a threat to production.\nSo, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we ’re not\nunnecessarily encouraging excessive risk -taking or other problems in the financial markets. We\ndo address that through a number of means , including monitoring the financial system,\nregulation , supervision, communication, and the like . But this is a potential concern that a\n\ndiscussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Then why would you leave forward guidance on the table?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’ t know what you mean by “ on the table.”\nBINYAMIN APPELB AUM. Why not use it as a tool to increase the power of asset\npurchases?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, again, I don’ t—we ’ve not been able to come to an\nagreement about what guidance we should give . And part of the concern is —is that as we go\nforward , we—you know, we ’ll have to factor in the efficacy , which is another issue. I mean,\nthere’ s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the\neconomy. So , as we move forward in time, we’ ll be learning about how effective the p olicy is ,\nand what cost s and risks there may be associated with it. And , as we do that, perhaps we w ill be\nable to give more -explicit guidance. And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more\neffective if we could give numerical guidance. But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has\ncome a long way. You know, in 1994, we didn’ t even tell people when we changed the federal\nfunds rate. Now, we ’re telling you when— you know, what the state of the economy is going to\nbe when we raise the federal funds rate. So, we are making progress in terms of forward\nguidance.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker . There have been a\nnumber of policies that have been float ed in the last few months regarding of strengthening U .S.\nbanks , one being increased —perhaps making adjustments to the Basel III ’s leverage ratio ,\nrequiring banks to hold long -term unsecured debt in the event of a resolution, and then, also ,\nplacing a cap on banks’ nondeposit liabilities. Firstly , is—do you agree with t hese policies and\n\ncontext of this question of too- big-to-fail, I mean, do you think these policies would actually help\nto finally convince the market and the publ ic that too -big-to-fail doesn ’t exist?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing\ntoo-big-to-fail. One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet , will be\nsurcharges on the largest banks —that is , the largest financial institutions will have to hold more\ncapital as a percent of their risk -weighted assets than smaller banks do. That will increase their\ncost of funding and, to some extent , will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and\nmake them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited. So I think that ’s an important step.\nAnd there are many other restrictions in both Dodd–Frank and Basel, including liquidity\nrestrictions and so on, that apply most strictly to the largest institutions.\nIn terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short -term\nuninsured funding does present some risks. And there are different ways to address that. But\none way to address it is through liquidity regulation. And both in our 165–166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing , the limits on\nhow much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take.\nAgain, I don’ t think too- big-to-fail is solved now. We ’re doing a number of things ,\nwhich I think will help. We need to keep assessing that , and we ’ll be able to tell by looking at\nmarket indicators , by doing our own stress test s and the like. And if we don’ t, you know, if we\ndon’t achieve the goal, I think we ’ll have to do additional steps. It is important. I mean, it ’s not\nsomething we can just forget about. It may take some time, but too -big-to-fail was a major part\nof the source of the crisis. And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don’ t\naddress that problem successfully.\n\nthe level for credit scores for new home loans rising into the 700s —is that something you would\nconsider to be a successful transm ission of monetary policy , and the —especially given how well\nthe Fed says that banks are capitalized ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets —I mean,\nour sense is that it ’s gone too far. I mean, some tightening was obviously needed. There were\npeople who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn’ t sustain a mortgage. So , terms\nand conditions have been tightened up, and we ’re now seeing much higher credit quality\nrequirements on potential borrowers. We are concerned that a variety of factors , such as\nconcerns about putbacks the banks may have , uncertainties about regulation —which we ’re\nworking on to get done as quickly as possible —may have tightened the mortgage credit box\nmore than would be desirable in a long -run healthy economy. That does have some effect on\nmonetary policy. One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and\nstimulating homebuying , construction, and related industries. So that is an issue that we take\ninto account. I would say one thing , which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and\nhome prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up. So , as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes,\nthey become more creditworthy. So, to some extent, not —I don’ t want to overstate it—but to\nsome extent, monetary policy —by strengthening the housing market , helping support house\nprices —is bringing more people into the mortgage market.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes of Fox Business, sir. The stock market has been hitting\nall-time highs. It’s recovered all of its losses from the financial crisis. I just want to know if I —\n\nit bad? Mission accomplished? And are you worried about bubbles? We’re still at 7.7 percent\nunemployment. I mean , is the —what do you think?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That ’s right. We ’re not targeting asset prices. We ’re not\nmeasuring success in terms of the stock market. We’re measuring success in terms of our\nmandate, wh ich is employment and price stability , and that ’s what we’ re trying to achieve. We\ndo monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate. It\nincludes the stock market and other asset markets. We use a variety of metrics. And I don’ t\nwant to , now , be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it.\nBut, in the stock market, you know, we don’ t see at this point anything that’ s out of line with\nhistorical patterns. In particular, you should remember , of course , that while the Dow may be\nhitting a high, it’ s in nominal term s, it’s not in real terms. And if you adjust for inflation and for\nthe growth of the economy, you know, we ’re still some distance from the high. I don’ t think it’ s\nall that surprising that the stock market would rise , given that there has been increased optimism\nabout the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high. P rofit increases\nhave been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly\nunusual at this point.\nMARCY GORDON. Thank you. Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press. Mr.\nChairman, the statement mentions that fiscal policy has become more restrictive. How much of a drag o n growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across -the-board\nspending cuts that went into effect on March 1? And is it possible that the Fed might see a need\nto provide more support to the economy if that —because of that drag , the drag on fiscal?\n\nCongressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress. And they estimate that putting\ntogether all the fiscal measures , including the f iscal c liff deal, the s equester, and other cuts, that\nfederal f iscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth,\nwhich, of course, is very significant. So , that is an issue for us. We —you know, we take as\ngiven what the fiscal authorit ies are doing. The economy is weaker. Job creation is slower than\nit would be otherwise. And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is. That being said, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fisca l restraint\nof that magnitude , and so the outcome will be wors e—or, in terms of jobs —than would\nhave been the case with less fiscal restraint. I want to emphasize that I do believe that long -term\nfiscal stability is extremely important. And I urge Congress and the Administration , as I always\ndo, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going\nforward. But , in doing so, I think it ’s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term\non what is s till not a completely satisfactory recovery.\nSTEVE BECKNER . Mr. Chairman, good afternoon. You earlier stressed that you want\nto see improvement in the labor market sustained , and that to make that determination, you have\nto have adequate economic growt h, and yet the projections in the revised Summary of Economic\nProjections has kind of a —it seems like an Okun ’s law dilemma there. You —they have reduced\nthe projected rate of unemployment, but , at the same time , lowered the growth forecast. So how\ndo you square those two? How do you get sustained improvement in the labor market if the economy is going to slow down?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, if in fact that happens, it ’s an issue , obviously.\nThere’ s been some disconnect , at least in the sh ort run , between unemployment rate changes and\n\nrelatively quickly even though growth has been more limited. So we ’re just going to have to\nmonitor developments in the economy and see what happens. You ’re right that we ’re not\nforecasting extraordinarily strong growth. But it is also true , as you —I think, you noted, that our\nprojections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were i n\nSeptember when we first announced this asset purchase program. So there has been some\nimprovement in the outlook, as measured by that metric. But you’ re right. You know, we do\nneed to see a sustained improvement. One month, two months doesn’ t cut it. And , normally,\nyou would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that. So we ’re just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see —\nyou know, see how things evolve.\nVICTORIA McGRANE . Hi, Chairman. Victoria McGrane with the Dow Jones\nNewswires. In the stress test that the Fed recently conducted, there were an adverse scenario and\na severely adverse scenario, and you published results of the —from the individual banks on—\nunder the adver se—severely adverse scenario .\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Right.\nVICTORIA McGRANE . But you didn’ t under the merely adverse scenario , which\nfeatured a n inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short -term rates. So , I have a two -part\nquestion. First, why didn’ t the Fed publish those results? And , second, even if you can’ t share\nhow individual banks performed, what did you learn from how —from the results you did see\nunder that adverse scenario?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the reason for publishing the seve rely adverse\nscenario, of course, is that ’s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently\n\nscenario would—obviously less strenuous, less stress ful, and they wouldn ’t have as much\ndifficulty. So , I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse\nscenario is the right one. That being said, I don’ t see any principl e reason why we couldn’ t\nprovide that information. I will find out at some point why we are doing it that way.\nThe severely adverse scenario is mostly just a scaling -up of the adverse scenario, f or the\nmost part . There are some differences. For example, we have used some of our work to look at\ninterest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also\nsustain a significant increase in long -term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of\nthem being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time. So, again, I think the severely adverse scenario is the one that really puts them to the test. But we ’re always talking about, you know, what information will be useful\nto investors and to the press.\nRYAN AVENT . Ryan Avent, The Economist . You’ve noted that most of the C ommittee\nmembers don’ t expect an increase in rates until 2015 or 2016, and it looks , in the projections , as\nthough the expectation for the long- run rate of the federal f unds target is around 4 percent , which\nwould be below the sort of peak rate we saw before the recession. Given the C ommittee ’s\nconcerns about unconventional policy, is there any feeling on the C ommittee that perhaps\nrecovery isn ’t going fast enough, and that m ore accommodation would be justified? And has\nthere been any discussion about a change in policy targets to try to stay effective without much of a cushion there between the f ed funds target rate and the zero lower bound?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as yo u point out, we ’re at the zero lower bound, and\nthat makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict , and\n\nyour question. We have —as you know, we have given this guideline for —so we call them\nsignposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time. And , as a lot of academic research\nshows, you know, when you’ re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you’re\ngoing to keep rates low for a significant period, that ’s one way to get longer -term rates down and\nto provide more stimulus to the economy. And we think this has been a pretty effective tool.\nNow, we could go further. We could lower even further , say, the unemployment rate number\nthat we hit. We ’ve discussed variants , and at least one member of the C ommittee has suggested\nthat. But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approx imate the —what ’s called the optimal c ontrol path of i nterest r ates, that\nit seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that ’s about as good as we can get with the\nmonetary policy tools that we have. It doesn ’t mean we ’re satisfied. It just means that we don’ t\nhave enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly. I don ’t know\nif that was responsive or not.\nRYAN AVENT . I guess I’ m not —given the concerns about unconventional policy\nrelative to normal interest rate policy, is there a feeling that more should be done so that when\nthe next potential recession rolls around, we have more room to cut rates, or are you comfortable just using th ese threshold policies on an ongoing basis?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . I see. So you’ re talking about the inflation target, basically.\nIs that fair?\nRYAN AVENT . Ye s, I think so.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Ye s, okay. So , historically, the argument for having\ninflation greater than zero —we define price stability as 2 percent inflation , as do most central\n\nWhy do you choose 2 percent instead of zero? ” And the answer is, the question you’ re raising ,\nwhich is that if you have zero inflation, you’ re very close to the deflation zone , and nominal\ninterest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions. And so,\nhistorical experience has suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of\ninflation and the cost that you’ re referring to. We haven ’t contemplated changing that. We just\nput that number in, as you know, fairly recently. I think at this point, it ’s still b eing debated in\nacademic circles that —you know, and we ’ll see what kind of outcome they come up with. But\nit’s an interesting question to try to quantify. There is research, for example, which asks the\nquestion, how often do you tend to hit the zero lowe r bound? And our belief a few years ago\nwas that it was a very rare event , and now it ’s become more common. So I ’m sure there’ ll be a\nlot of thinking about this in academic and other circles.\nBEN WEYL. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Ben Weyl, Congressional Quarte rly. There’ s a lot of\ntalk about whether certain institutions are too big to fail. And I wanted to get at a different, if\nrelated, question. In 1980, let ’s say , there was about —the financial sector comprised about\n5 percent of the U .S. economy, U .S. GDP ; now it ’s about 9 percent. And I ’m wondering if you\nthink that shift is beneficial to the U .S. economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’ t think I know the answer to that question. Certainly,\nthe financial system has —I could argue two ways. I could say, wel l, the U .S. economy grew\npretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980. And the financial system was much simpler and didn’ t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on. So that would be —that would be one way to\nargue that maybe, you know, all of this extra financial activity is not justified. On the other\nhand, the world is a lot more complicated. We ’re a lot —the world is a lot more international.\n\ndifferent co untries. There ’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services , and so on.\nSo, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created\nin lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be some what bigger. So I don’ t\nreally know the answer to that question. I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker ’s claim that\nthe only contribution to the financial industry is the a utomatic t eller m achine might be a little\nexaggerated. I know that people —some people have that view. Again, I don’ t know the answer.\nI think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and\nthe more globalized financial economic system that we have. But the exact number, I can ’t\nreally say.\nJEREMY TORDJMAN. Hi, I ’m Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP Newswire Agency. I\nhave a follow -up question on Cyprus. As a central banker, do you think it was either appropriate\nor fair to impose a levy on every bank deposit in Cyprus , even those insured by the European\nUnion itself? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I\ndon’t necessarily know all the details , and so I know they ’re grappling with a very difficult\nproblem. I think the issue they face is that there’ s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense\nthat there is a fiscal issue and there ’s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue. So , they ’re\nlooking for resources where they can find them. I think everyone understands that there are\ncertain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower -income people. There is the issue\nof setting a pre cedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods. But again,\nthat being said, it ’s a very tough issue. An d I—and finding the resources to solve Cyprus ’s\n\nthat. But I don’ t envy them that particular challenge.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. There’ s been a trend in the last couple of years where the\neconomy kind of jumped out of the gate in the first part of the year only to kind of falter. Is that\nsomething that you’ re worried about this year? And does that suggest that QE might have to stay\nkind of at the same pace you are now and some into the third quarter until we ’re sure about\nthat—that trend?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, you’ re absolutely right that there ’s been a certain\ntendency for a spring slump that we ’ve seen a few times. One possible explanation for that —\nbesides some freaky things, some weather events and so on, one possible explanation is\nseasonality. Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted.\nAnd they may have led —and I say “ may” because the statistical experts —many of them deny it,\nbut it’ s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the\nyear. Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we ’re far enough away from the recession\nthat those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now. So if we do , in fact , see\na slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes and then we would obviously have\nto respond to that. As I said , we’re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the\noutlook, a nd that can go either direction.\nDONALD JUDD. Donald Judd, CBS News. I was wondering if you could tell me how ,\nif a run on the banks happens in Cyprus, how that might affect U .S. markets. And also, is it\npossible for the U .S. to levy a tax on regular deposits here , or why not?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy ,\nand I don’ t think that these issues , as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for\n\nonly way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some\nsense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence. But at this point, I ’m not awar e of any\nevidence that that is , in fact , the case. The argument the Europeans are making is that Cyprus is\na very unique situation, very different situation. And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to thei r economy. In terms of the United States, you\nknow, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, a nd insured deposits , and they’re very proud of\nthe fact that no one ’s ever lost a dime in insured deposits. And , during the crisis, the response of\nthe government was , in fact , to increase the level of, you know, depositor account sizes that were\ninsured. So I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States.\nDON LEE. Don Lee at the L .A. Times . Would you be in favor of reducing the flow of\nstimulus if we had another month or two, as we did in February , of job growth and the\nunemployment rate dropping, but the long -term unemployed didn’ t change much? And , on a\nrelated question, how much of a pickup do you expect to see in the labor force participation rate,\nand what will we need to see there for that to show substantial improvement?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. On the first question, as I said, I mean that ’s a decision for\nthe C ommittee. We ’re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement\nis, how sustained it is. Long -term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment\nproblem. But I think that probably the best way to get the long -term unemployed back to work is\nto get an overall strong labor market. And I think that ’s—we ’d be looking at the overall key\nindicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned. The other part of your question was about —\nDON LEE. Labor force.\n\nhas been declining on a trend- like basis in the United States for a while. That ’s the result ,\nmostly , of demographic factors , partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female\nparticipation is no longer increasing —it’ s in fact decreasing a little bit. It’s also the case that\nlabor force attachment within people of working age has declined for a number of different\nreasons. So there ’s a trend underlying this. And , in addition, there are probably some people\nwho’ve left the labor force just because they are discouraged and they can ’t find work. So , as the\neconomy strengthens, the labor market strengthens, I would expect to see some of these folks coming back into the labor force. For example, the number of people who are out of the labor force but say they would like a full -time job but are not actually counted as unemployed, that\nnumber has actually been going up, w hich suggest s that there are more people thinking about\ngoing back into the labor force, going back to work. But I doubt that , in the near term at least ,\nthat we ’ll see an increase in labor force participation because— besides the effects of the slow\nrecovery, high unemployment , we’ve had a downward trend in the U .S., which is not due to the\nrecession , it’s due to underlying demographic factors.\nCATHERINE HOLLANDER. Catherine Hollander from National Journal . You argued\nin a 1999 paper and a 2002 speech that monetary policy was not the right tool for addressing asset bubbles. But in January, you suggested that there might be a role for it , even if not as the\nfirst line of defense. Has your thinking on the issue evolved, and can you explain why?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I still believe the following , which is that monetary\npolicy is a very blunt instrument. If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if\nyou were sure you can do that, you might , at the same time , be throwing the economy into\nrecession , which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy. And therefore, I think the first\n\nvery extensive and sophisticated monitoring at a much higher level and much more\ncomprehensively than we ’ve had in the past. Then we have supervision and regulation, where\nwe work with other agencies to try to cover all the empty or uncovered areas in the financial\nsystem. And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to a ffect the way\nthat financial markets respond to monetary policy. So we do have some first lines of defense ,\nwhich I think should be used first. That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ ve had —not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years —that we need\nto at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy. And I think most of the people on the FOMC would agree with that. What that means exact ly depends on the\ncircumstances. I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low\nfor that purpose, it ’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you ’re concerned\nabout some sector in the financial sphere. On the other hand, if you’ re in an expansion and\nthere’ s a credit boom going on, that —the case in that situation for making policy a little bit\ntighter might be better. So , as I ’ve said many times, I have an open mind in this question. We ’re\nlearning ; all central bankers are learning. But I think I still would agree with the point I made in\nmy very first speech in 2002, as a Governor at the Federal Reserve , where I argued that the first\nline of defense ought to be the more targeted tools that we have , including regulatory tools and,\nto some extent , macroprudential tools like some emerging markets use.\nPETER COOK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As tempted as I might be to end with your\nNCAA picks or your view of the Nationals, I have something a little more serious for you, in line\nwith what John asked you about —your future. Given the unprecedented nature of Fed policy on\nyour watch and the uncertainty surrounding the exit strategy, to what extent do you feel\n\nyour future? And , more specifically, sir, the last time we gathered here at the press conference,\nyou were asked if you ’d spoken with the President about your future, and you said you hadn’ t at\nthat time. Could you at least tell us if you ’ve had the conversation?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . I’ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don’ t have\nany—I don’ t really have any information for you at this juncture. I don’ t think that I ’m the only\nperson in the world who can manage the exit. In fact, one of the things that I hope to\naccomplish , and was not entirely successful at , as the Governor or as the Chairman of the Federal\nReserve, was to try to depersonalize, to some extent, monet ary policy and financial policy and to\nget broader recognition of the fact that this is an extraordinary institution. It has a large number of very high quality policymakers. It has a terrific staff —literally dozens of Ph.D. economists\nwho’ve been working through the crisis , trying to understand these issues and implement our\npolicy tools, and there ’s no single person who is essential to that. But , again, with respect to my\npersonal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete.\nThank you."
