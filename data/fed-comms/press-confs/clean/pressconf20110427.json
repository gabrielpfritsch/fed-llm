  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon. Welcome.\nIn my opening remarks, I’d like to briefly fi rst review today’s polic y decision. I’ll then\nturn next to the Federal Open Market Committe e’s quarterly economic pr ojections also being\nreleased today, and I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of the Committee’s\nprojections and the Federal Re serve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability. I’ll then be glad to take your questions. Throughout today’s briefing, my goal\nwill be to reflect the consensus of the Committee, while taking note of the diversity of views as\nappropriate. Of course, my remarks and in terpretations are my own responsibility.\nIn its policy statement rel eased earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is\nmaintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and,\nsecond, that it will complete its planned pur chases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities by the end of the current quarter. Of course, going forward, the Committee will\nregularly review the size and composition of it s securities holdings in light of incoming\ninformation and is prepared to adjust those hol dings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s\nmandate.\nThe Committee made no change today in the ta rget range of the fede ral funds rate, which\nremains at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee c ontinues to anticipate th at economic conditions,\nincluding low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation\nexpectations, are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an\nextended period.\n\nIn conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for\neconomic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and\nover the longer run. These pr ojections are conditional on ea ch participant’s individual\nassessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives. A table showing the projections has been distributed. I’m going to focus today on\nthe central tendency projections, wh ich exclude the three highest a nd three lowest projections for\neach variable in each year.\nI call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent\nparticipants’ assessments of the rates to whic h economic growth, unemployment, and inflation\nwill converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to\nthe economy. As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central\ntendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey. The longer-run projections for\nthe unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in\nJanuary. These figures may be interpreted as pa rticipants’ current estimates of the economy’s\nnormal, or trend, rate of growth and its nor mal unemployment rate over the longer run,\nrespectively. The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined\nlargely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of\ntechnological change, and it should be noted that estimates of thes e rates are inherently uncertain\nand subject to revision over time.\nThe central tendency of the longer-run projecti on for inflation, as measured by the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent. In contrast to economic\ngrowth and unemployment, the l onger-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by\nmonetary policy; consequently, and given that th ese projections are based on the assumption that\n\nmonetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the\ninflation rate that Committee partic ipants judge to be most consis tent with the Federal Reserve’s\nmandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices. At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-\nconsistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons. Perhaps most\nimportant, attempting to maintain inflation at ze ro would increase the ri sk of experiencing an\nextended bout of deflation, or falling wages and pr ices, which in turn could lead employment to\nfall below its maximum sustainable level for a prot racted period. Hence, a goal of literally zero\ninflation is not consistent with the Federal Re serve’s dual mandate. Indeed, most central banks\naround the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at ab out 2 percent.\nI turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook. As indicated in today’s policy\nstatement, the Committee sees the economic reco very as proceeding at a moderate pace.\nHousehold spending and investment in equipmen t and software continue to expand, supporting\nthe recovery, but nonresidential inve stment is still weak and the hous ing sector is depressed. In\nthe labor market, overall conditions continue to improve gradually. For example, the\nunemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employm ent increased in March; new\nclaims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with\ncontinued improvement.\nLooking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through\n2011, with some acceleration of growth projecte d for 2012 and 2013. Specifically, as the table\nshows, participants’ projections for output grow th have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent\nfor this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013. These projections\nare a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in\nparticular reflects the somewhat slower-than-antici pated pace of growth in the first quarter.\n\nThe outlook for above-trend growth is associ ated with a projected reduction in the\nunemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of\nthis year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well\nabove the central tendency of participants’ l onger-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to\n5.6 percent. The projected decline in the unemplo yment rate is relatively slow largely because\neconomic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.\nOn the inflation front, commodity prices ha ve risen significantly recently, reflecting\ngeopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors. Increases in\ncommodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation. However, measures of\nunderlying inflation, though having increased mode stly in recent months, remain subdued, and\nlonger-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable. Consequently, the Committee expects\nthe effects on inflation of higher commodity pr ices to be transitory; as the increases in\ncommodity prices moderate, inflat ion should decline toward its unde rlying level. Specifically,\nparticipants’ projections for infl ation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year,\nnoticeably higher than in the Ja nuary projections, before declin ing to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012\nand then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January.\nThe Committee’s economic projections provi de important contex t for understanding\ntoday’s policy action as well as the Committee’ s general policy strategy. Monetary policy\naffects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the\nlikely future course of the economy. Thus the Committee’s projections of the economy, not just\ncurrent conditions alone, must gui de its policy decisions. The lags with which monetary policy\naffects the economy also imply that the Co mmittee must focus on meeting its mandated\nobjectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer,\n\ndepending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nTo foster maximum employment , the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient\neconomic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level. At\n8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward\nmore normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow. The subs tantial ongoing slack in\nthe labor market and the relativel y slow pace of improvement rema in important reasons that the\nCommittee continues to maintain a highl y accommodative monetary policy.\nIn the medium term, the Committee also seek s to achieve a mandate -consistent inflation\nrate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less.\nAlthough the recent surge in commodity prices has le d inflation to pick up somewhat in the near\nterm, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the\nmedium term, as I have discussed. Consequentl y, the short-term increase in inflation has not\nprompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture. Impor tantly, however, the\nCommittee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term in flation expectations remaining\nstable; if households and firms continue to expe ct inflation to return to a mandate-consistent\nlevel in the medium term, then increased comm odity prices are unlikel y to induce significant\nsecond-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal\nwages. Thus, besides monitoring inflation it self, the Committee will pay close attention to\ninflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.\nIn providing extraordinary monetary policy a ccommodation in the aftermath of the crisis,\nthe Committee has not only reduced its target for th e federal funds rate to a very low level, but\nhas also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet substantially. The Committee at this\n\nmeeting continued its ongoing discussion of the available tools for removing policy\naccommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate. The Committee remains confident that it has the tools th at it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that\neconomic conditions warrant such a step. And in choosing the time to begin policy\nnormalization as well as the pace of that normaliza tion, we will carefully consider both parts of\nour dual mandate.\nThank you again, and I’d be glad to take your questions.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter\nGDP number. Your own projections for the year have been downgraded in this meeting. How—\nfirst of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with\nmonetary easing, even with payr oll tax cuts? And what’s behi nd this weaker forecast for 2011\nGDP?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. You’re correct. We haven’t seen the GDP number yet. But\nwe, like most private-sector forecasters, are e xpecting a relatively weak number for the first\nquarter, maybe something a little und er 2 percent. Most of the f actors that account for the slower\ngrowth in the first quarter appear to us to be tr ansitory. They include things like, for example,\nlower defense spending than was anticipated, wh ich will presumably be made up in a later\nquarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick\nup again; and other factors like w eather and so on. Now, there are some factors there that may\nhave a longer-term implication. For example, c onstruction, both residential and nonresidential,\nwas very weak in the first quarter, and that ma y have some implications going forward. So I\nwould say that, roughly, that most of the sl owdown in the first quarter is viewed by the\nCommittee as being transitory. Th at being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking\n\ninto account factors like—like w eaker construction and possibly ju st a bit less momentum in the\neconomy.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, given what you know about the pace of the economy now,\nwhat is your best guess for how soon the Fed ne eds to begin to withdraw its extraordinary\nstimulus for the economy? And could you also say what is your working definition of what “extended period” means from the purposes of the Fed statement?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, currently as the statement suggests, we are in a\nmoderate recovery. We’ll be looking very carefu lly, first, to see if th at recovery is, indeed,\nsustainable, as we believe it is . And we’ll also be looking very closely at the labor market.\nWe’ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last\nyear, but we’d like to see continued improve ment—more job creation going forward. At the\nsame time, we’re also looking very carefully at in flation, the other part of our mandate. As I’ve\nnoted, inflation—headline inflati on—is at least temporarily hi gher, being driven by gasoline\nprices and some other commodity prices. Our expectation is that —that inflation will come down\ntowards a more normal level. But we’ll be watc hing that carefully and also watching inflation\nexpectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re\ngoing to see inflation remain under good control. So to answ er your question, I don’t know\nexactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins. It ’s going to depend obviously on\nthe outlook and on those criteria which I s uggested. The “extended period” language is\nconditioned on exactly those same points: “Ext ended period” is conditioned on resource slack,\non subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expect ations. Once those conditions are violated, or\nare we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.\n“Extended period” suggests that there would be a couple of meetings probably before—before\n\naction. But, unfortunately, the reason we use th is vaguer terminology is that we don’t know with\ncertainty how quickly response will be require d, and, therefore, we will do our best to\ncommunicate changes in our view as—but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, first, thanks for doing this. This is a tremendous\ndevelopment. There are critics who say that Fe d policy has driven down the value of the dollar,\nand a lower value to the dollar reduces Americans’ standard of living. How do you respond to\nthe criticism that, essentially, Fed policy ha s reduced Americans’ standard of living?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks, Steve. Fi rst, I should start by saying that the\nSecretary of the Treasury, of course, is the spokesperson for U.S. policy on the dollar and\nSecretary Geithner had some words yesterday. Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying\nthat the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and\nin the interest of the global economy. There ar e many factors that cause the dollar to move up\nand down over short periods of time. But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed,\nwe’re doing two things. First, we are trying to maintain lo w and stable inflation by our\ndefinition of price stability by maintaining the pur chasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation\nlow. That’s obviously good for the dollar. The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get\na stronger recovery and to achieve maximu m employment. And, again, a strong economy,\ngrowing, with attracting foreign capi tal, is going to be good for the do llar. So in our view, if we\ndo what’s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that\nwill also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term.\nQUESTION. I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman, one can’t help but noticing that it’s been\nunsuccessful so far.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the dollar—th e dollar fluctuates. One factor, for\nexample, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the\nsafe-haven effect. So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money\nflowed in to the Treasury ma rket and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially,\nreflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liqui d in the world. And a\nlot of what you’ve seen over th e last couple of years is just th e unwinding of that as the economy\nhas strengthened and as uncertain ty has—has been reduced. But that’s indicativ e, I think, of\nthe—of the high standing that the dollar still re tains in the world. Again, ultimately, the best\nthing we can do to create strong fundamentals for th e dollar in the medium te rm is to, first, keep\ninflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong\neconomy.\nQUESTION. Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Many Americans\nare upset that gasoline prices are rising so fa st and that food prices are also going up. Can you\ntalk about whether there’s anyt hing that the Fed can or should do about that? And can you also\ncomment or elaborate on the increase that we’ve s een in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put\nout today?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure. Thanks, J on. So, first of all, gasoline prices\nobviously have risen quite significantly. And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that\nhigher gas prices are absolutely creating a great d eal of financial hardship for a lot of people.\nAnd gas, of course, is a necessity. People need to drive to get to work. So it’s obviously a very\nbad development to see gas prices rise so much. Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make\neconomic developments less favorable. On the one hand, obviously, the highe r gas prices add to\ninflation. On the other hand, by draining purchas ing power from households, higher gas prices\n\nare also bad for the recovery. They cause growth to decline as well. So it’s a double whammy\ncoming from higher gasoline prices. Now, our—our in terpretation of the incr ease in gas prices is\nthe economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand. On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy. Emerging market econo mies are growing very quickly, and their\ndemand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong. Indeed, essentially all of the\nincrease in the demand for oil in the last coupl e of years and the last decade has come from\nemerging market economies. In the United St ates, our demand for oil—our imports have\nactually been going down over time. So the de mand is coming from a growing economy where\nwe’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emer ging market output in the last—since before the\ncrisis. And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we’ve seen\ndisruptions in the Middle East and North Afri ca, in Libya, and in other places that have\nconstrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up\nquite significantly. So, again, this is a very adve rse development. It accounts in the short run for\nthe increase in our—pretty much almost all of the in crease in our inflation forecast, at least in the\nvery near term. There’s not much the Federal Re serve can do about gas prices, per se, at least\nnot without derailing growth entirely, which is ce rtainly not the right way to go. After all, the\nFed can’t create more oil. We don’t control th e growth rates of emerging market economies.\nWhat we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and\nwages throughout the economy and creating a br oader inflation, which would be much more\ndifficult to extinguish. Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure,\nbut we’ll be watching carefully—our vi ew is that gas prices will not c ontinue to rise at the recent\npace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stab ilizes in the Middle East, that\nthat will provide some relief on the inflation front. But we’ll have to watch it very carefully.\n\nQUESTION. Thank you. Scott Lanman from Bloomberg News. Mr. Chairman, you’ve\nstated several times this year that the recovery won’t be fully established until we see a sustained\nperiod of stronger job creation. Fi rst, has it become truly establis hed yet? And, if not, what’s\nyour definition of a sustained pe riod, and what’s your definition of str onger job creation?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as I mentione d, we’ve made a lot of progress. Last\nAugust when we began to talk about another r ound of securities purchases, growth was very\nmoderate. And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to\nbring the unemployment rate down. Since then, we have seen a reasonable amount of payroll\ncreation, job creation. And that picked up in th e most recent few months, together with the\ndecline in the unemployment rate from, you know, 10 percent down to the current rate of 8.8\npercent. So the labor market is improving gradually, as we say in our statement. And we’d just\nlike to make sure that that is sustainable, and the l onger it goes on, the more confident we are.\nAnd, again, it is encouraging to see the improveme nt that we’ve seen in recent months. That\nbeing said, the pace of improvement is still quite slow, and we are digging ourselves out of a\nvery, very deep hole. We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis. And so, clea rly, the fact that we’re moving in the right direction, even though\nthat’s encouraging, doesn’t mean that the labor ma rket is in good shape. Obviously, it’s not.\nAnd we’re going to have to, you know, continue to watch and hope that we will get stronger and\nincreasingly strong job creation going forward.\nQUESTION. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, you say in your\nstatement that longer-term infla tion expectations have remained stable, but a number of measures\nof inflation expectations have risen in recent mo nths. And it’s clear from your forecast that you\nexpect headline inflation to run above core infl ation for some period. Is there anything that the\n\nFederal Reserve can do to prevent the public from maybe incorrectly assuming that a period of\nhigher inflation is on its wa y as a result? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are\nconcerned about are medium-term inflation expect ations. So we’ve seen, for example, in the\nfinancial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan\nsurvey, we’ve seen near-term inflation expectati ons rise fairly significan tly, which is reasonable\ngiven higher commodity prices, higher gas prices. But for the most part, although there’s been\nsome movement here and there, for the most pa rt, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term\ninflation expectations have not re ally moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that\nthe Fed will ensure that inflation in the medi um term will be close to what I’ve called the\nmandate-consistent level. What can we do? In the short run, we can communicate and try to\nmake sure the public understands what our polic y is attempting to do, to be clear what our\nobjectives are and what steps we’re willing to ta ke to meet those objectives. Ultimately, if—if\ninflation persists or if inflati on expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action.\nWe would have—we would have to respond. I think—w hile it is very, very important for us to\ntry to help the economy create jobs and to s upport the recovery, I thi nk every central banker\nunderstands that keeping inflation lo w and stable is absolutely esse ntial to a successful economy.\nAnd we will do what’s necessary to ensure that that happens.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, what will be the impact on the economic recovery, job\ncreation, and rates on mortgages and other loans when the Fed ends its $600 billion bond-buying\nprogram? And a quick follow-up is, Will the Fed continue—how long with the Fed continue to\nallow for reinvestments?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. As I—as I’ve note d and as you’re all aware, we are—we\nare going to complete the program at the end of the second quarter, $600 billion. We are going\nto do that pretty much without tapering. We’re ju st going to let the purchas es end. Our view is\nthat—based on past experience a nd based on our analysis—is that the end of the program is\nunlikely to have significant effects on financ ial markets or on the economy, the reason being\nthat, first—just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today—we hope we have\ncommunicated what we’re planning to do. And the markets have well anticipated this step. And\nyou would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have\nrelatively small effects because whatever effects you’re going to have would have already been\ncapitalized in the financial markets. Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the\nstock view of the effects of securities purch ases, which—by which I mean that what matters\nprimarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather\nthe size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserv e holds. And so, when we complete the program,\nas you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest maturing securities, bo th Treasuries and MBS,\nand so the amount of securities th at we hold will remain approxima tely constant. Therefore, we\nshouldn’t expect any major effect of that. Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy\neasing, should essentially remain constant go ing forward from—from Ju ne. At some point,\npresumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we’ve been having around the FOMC table, it’s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all\nor part of the securities whic h are coming—which are maturing. But take note that that step,\nalthough a relatively modest step, does const itute a policy tighteni ng because it would be\nlowering the size of our balance sh eet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten\nfinancial conditions. That being said, we therefore have to ma ke that decision based on the\n\noutlook, based on our view of how sustainable th e recovery is and what the condition—the\nsituation is respect to inflation. So we will base that decision on the evolving outlook.\nQUESTION. Do you think it will be several months away?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It depends on th e outlook. The Committee will have to\nmake a judgment.\nQUESTION. Is it in the Fed’ s power to reduce the rate of unemployment more quickly?\nHow would you do that, and why are you not doing it?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I should say, firs t of all, that, in terms of trying to\nhelp this economy stabilize and then recover, the Federal Rese rve has undertaken extraordinary\nmeasures. Those include, obviously, all the steps we took to stabilize the financial system during\nthe crisis—again, many of which were extr aordinary measures taken under extreme\ncircumstances. Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new\nways to ease monetary policy. We’ve brought the fe deral funds rate target close to zero. We\nhave used forward guidance in our language to af fect expectations of po licy changes. And, of\ncourse, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term\nsecurities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing fi nancial conditions and,\ntherefore, providing support for recovery and fo r employment. Going forward, we’ll have to\ncontinue to make judgments abou t whether additional steps are warranted. But as we do so, we\nhave to keep in mind that we do have a dual ma ndate, that we do have to worry about both the\nrate of growth but also the inflation rate. A nd as I was indicating earl ier, I think that—even\npurely from an employment persp ective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation\nexpectations were to rise signifi cantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the\nfuture, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant. And so we do have to make sure\n\nthat we are paying adequate atten tion to both sides of our mandate. But clearly it is the case that\nwe have done extraordinary things in orde r to try to help this economy recover.\nQUESTION. John Ydstie with NPR News. Mr. Chairman, it’s the view of a lot of\neconomists that the second round of quantitative easing hasn’t done much to help the economy.\nWhat positive effects can you point to directly? And if there are positive effects, can you really\nafford to end the program in June, with th e unemployment rate still around 9 percent?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Well, fi rst, I do believe th at the second round\nof securities purchases was effective. We saw that first in the financial markets. The way\nmonetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions. And we saw increases in stock\nprices. We saw reduced spreads in credit market s. We saw reduced volatility. We saw all the\nchanges in financial markets and quite significa nt changes that one w ould expect if one was\ndoing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate. And, indeed, we saw the\nsame types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009. So\nwe were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get. We did get very significant\neasing from this program. You would expect , based on decades of experience, that easing\nfinancial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well. As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony\nin the beginning of March, between late August wh en I first indicated th at the Federal Reserve\nwas seriously considering this additional step an d early this year, not only the Federal Reserve\nbut many outside forecasters upgra ded their forecasts. And we saw—we saw strengthening labor\nmarket conditions, higher rates of payroll job creation, et cetera. Now, the conclusion, therefore,\nthat the second round of securiti es purchases was ineffective c ould only be validated if one\nthought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return\n\nus to full employment overnight. We were very clear from the beginni ng that, while we thought\nthis was an important step and th at it was at an important time wh en we were all worried about a\ndouble dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be\na panacea, that it was only going to turn the ec onomy in the right direction. And, indeed, we\npublished some analytics which gave job crea tion numbers which were significant but not—\ncertainly not enough to completely solve the enor mous jobs problem that we have. So, again,\nrelative to what we expected, an ticipated, I think the program wa s successful. Why not do more?\nAgain, this was similar to the question I received earlier. The tradeoffs are getting—are getting\nless attractive at this point. Inflation has gotten hi gher. Inflation expectat ions are a bit higher.\nIt’s not clear that we can get substantial im provements in payrolls without some additional\ninflation risk. And, in my view , if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable\nrecovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to ke ep inflation under control. So we’ve got to look\nat both of those—both parts of the ma ndate as we—as we choose policy.\nQUESTION. I’m Luca Di Leo from Dow J ones. Mr. Chairman, what’s the right\nresponse if high oil prices persist? On the one hand, they push inflation higher. On the other,\nthey can hurt the economy by hitting spending. In the current environment, what’s the best\nstrategy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we’re going to continue to—to see what happens.\nOur anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down. If that happens or if at\nleast oil prices don’t increase si gnificantly further, then inflation will—will come down, and\nwe’ll have—we’ll be close to our medium-term objectives. So, as we look at oil prices, you\nknow, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situati on. I do think that one of the\nkey things that we’ll be looking at will be in flation expectations because, if medium-term\n\ninflation expectations remain we ll anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on—at least\non an ongoing, sustained basis—thes e higher costs into broader pr ices, into creating a broader\ninflation in the economy, as l ong as inflation expectations ar e well—are well stabilized, that\nwon’t happen, then we’ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things\nevolve. Again, if we fear that inflation exp ectations look like they’r e becoming less anchored,\nwe would have to respond to that.\nQUESTION. Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report . You’ve talked a lot in the past\nabout the problem of long-term unemployment. Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term\nunemployment?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first, you ’re absolutely right. Long-term\nunemployment in the current economy is—is the wors t—really the worst it’s been in the postwar\nperiod. Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for\nsix months or longer. And we know the conseque nces of that can be very distressing because\npeople who are out of work for a long time, thei r skills tend to atrophy—th ey lose contacts with\nthe labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up. And we saw\nin the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, th at a period of high\nunemployment with very long-te rm unemployment spells can act ually lead unemployment to\nremain very high for a protracted period. So it is a very significant con cern. And it’s one of the\nreasons that—that the Federal Reserve has been so aggressive. By getting unemployment down,\nwe hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have\nand, in that respect, try to avoi d the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for\nmonths at a time. So that’s part of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have. As\nthe situation drags on and as the long-term unempl oyed lose skills and lose contact with the labor\n\nmarket or perhaps just become discouraged and stop looking for work, then it becomes really out\nof the scope of monetary policy. At that poi nt, job training, educati on, and other types of\ninterventions would probably be more effective than monetary policy.\nQUESTION. Could I just follow up? So a lo t of the long-term unemployment that we’re\nseeing now, do you think that’s out of th e scope of what the Fed can do?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, indirectly, of course, if—to the extent that we can\nhelp the economy recover and he lp job creation proceed, then so me of the people who get jobs\nwill be those who’ve been out of work for a long time. That being said, we don’t have any tools\nfor targeting long-term unemployment specificall y. We just—can just try to make the labor\nmarket work better, broadly speaking.\nQUESTION. Peter Barnes, of Fox Business Network, Mr. Chairman. Last week,\nStandard & Poor’s put the United St ates’ debt on a negative watch for the very first time ever.\nWhat is your reaction to that? And are you concerned, are you worried that the United States is\ngoing to lose its triple-A credit rating?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, in one sens e, S&P’s action didn’t really tell us\nanything because everybody who reads the newspape r knows that the United States has a very\nserious long-term fiscal problem. That being said, I’m hopeful that this event will provide at\nleast one more incentive for Congress and the Administration to—to address this problem. I\nthink it’s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States\nfaces. We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.\nAnd if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living. It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on\nboth sides of the aisle to think a bout this issue from a long-run pe rspective. It’s not a problem\n\nthat can be solved by making changes only for the ne xt six months. It’s really a long-run issue.\nWe’re still a long way from a solution, obviously. But it is, I think, of the highest importance\nthat our political leaders address this very difficult problem as quickly and as effectively as they\ncan. And to the extent that the S&P action goads a response, I think that’s —that’s constructive.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, John Berry. In the past, there have been times when fiscal\npolicy has tightened, and the Federal Reserve has c hosen to ease its policy in response partly to\nthat, given whatever the circumst ances in the economy were at th e time. Congress appears intent\nat this point in cutting spendi ng significantly; it might restrain the economy as it appears to be\ndoing in Britain where they’re following a simila r path. Is there anyt hing the Fed can do or\nshould do if, indeed, there ar e large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first let me say that, addressing the fiscal deficit,\nparticularly the long-run unsustainable deficit, is a top priority. And not hing I would want to say\nwould be—should be construed as saying that I think it’s anything other than a top priority. It’s\nvery, very important that our lead ers address this—address this issu e. I would also say that the\ncuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-\nterm economic activity. Now, my preference in te rms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is\nto take a long-term perspective. It’s a long-term problem. If Congress and the Administration\nare able to make credible commitments to cut ting programs or in any way changing the fiscal\nprofile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address\nwhat is, in fact, a long-run problem. If the chan ges are focused entirely on the short run, then\nthey might have some consequences for growth. And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is,\nas always, going to try to set monetary polic y to meet our mandate, would take those into\n\naccount appropriately. But so far, I’ve not seen any fiscal changes that have really changed our\nnear-term outlook.\nQUESTION. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m Toshi Ogata with the Asahi Shimbun ,\nJapanese newspaper. I’d like to ask about uncertainties in the gl obal economy or downside risks.\nIn minutes from the March meeting, you—the Co mmittee noted that the development in Japan\nincreased uncertainties. So what’s the latest a ssessment on those risks or uncertainties such as\ntragedy in Japan or crisis in Europe and uprising in the Middle East? And what would be the\nimpact of those on the U.S. economy and the world economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, one of the things that our pr ojections include—you\nknow, we’re only producing the forecast today—with our minutes in three weeks, we’ll include\nthe full detailed projections as we normally do. One of the things that we include is the views of\nthe participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the fore cast going forward. And I think I\ncan say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC partic ipants do see quite a\nbit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that un certainty is coming from global\nfactors. I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have\naffected oil prices, conditions in emerging mark ets which have affected commodity prices and\nother things. The European situation continues, and we’re watching that very carefully. Now,\nobviously, you asked about Japan. Let me first sa y, you know, that I’ve had a lot of contact with\nmy Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese\ngovernment. We collaborated with them on th e foreign exchange in tervention, as you know.\nAnd we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in respondi ng to these situations\nand of—the central bank of Japan has done, I th ink, a good job in providing liquidity and helping\nto stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbanc es to the economy. The\n\nimplications for Japan have been discussed at some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa\nrecently talked about them. In the near term, th ere will probably be a decline in Japanese output,\nreflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity pr oblems, et cetera. We believe that will be\nrelatively temporary and that the eco nomy will start to come back. But, of course, this is a major\nblow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and\nto recover from the damage that was done by the —by the tragedy. For the United States, we are\nlooking at this very carefully. Thus far, the ma in impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S.\neconomy has been through supply chains. We’ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain components which are ma nufactured mostly or\nentirely in Japan. And that ha s led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain\nproduction for a time. So there may be some moderate effect on—on the U.S. economy. But we\nexpect it to be moderate and to be temporary. Again, the most important issue here is—is the\nrecovery of Japan, and our good wishes go out to the Japanese people and their efforts to\novercome the adversity that they’re facing.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, you have often st ressed, as indeed you did again today, the\nimportance of keeping inflation exp ectations low and stable to keep inflation itself under control.\nBut irrespective of inflationary expectations or psychology, isn’t it possible that the Fed’s\npolicies could be providing the monetary tinde r for inflation the longer they continue?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we—we view our monetary policies as being not that\ndifferent from ordinary monetary policy. I mean, it’s true that we’v e used some different tools.\nBut those tools are operating through financia l conditions, and we have a lot of experience\nunderstanding how financial conditi ons—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and\nso on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation. So we are monitoring\n\nthe state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook. And our intention, as is always the\ncase, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled,\nthat we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a\nstable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market. So the problem is the same one\nthat central banks always face, which is choos ing the appropriate path of tightening at the\nappropriate stage of the recover y. It’s difficult to get it exac tly right, but we have a lot of\nexperience in terms of what are the consider ations and the economics that underlie those\ndecisions. So we anticipate that we will tighten at the right time and that we will thereby allow\nthe recovery to continue and a llow the economy to return to a mo re normal configuration, at the\nsame time keeping inflation low and stable.\nQUESTION. Hughes Honore, Agence France-Pre sse. Many of the commercial partners\nof the United States are very conc erned about the evolution of your foreign exchange rate. If in\none hypothetical case the do llar would sink to a terrible level which would harm very much the\nU.S. economy and the prospect for the global ec onomy because it affects the confidence of so\nmany people, would you consider changing your mone tary policy in accordance to that threat?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as I said earlier, we do believe that a strong and stable\ndollar is in the interest of the United States and is in the inte rest of the global economy. Our\nview is that the best thing we can do for the dolla r is, first, to keep the purchasing power of the\ndollar strong by keeping infl ation low and by creating a stronger economy through—through\npolicies which support the recovery and, therefore, cause more capital inflows to the United\nStates. So those are the kinds of policies I think that in th e medium term will create the\nconditions for an appropriate and healthy level of the dollar. So I don’t think I really want to\naddress a hypothetical which I real ly don’t anticipate, beca use I think that the policies that we are\n\nundertaking, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the\nmedium term.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, Anthony Mason, CBS. This is that rare news conference\nthat actually makes news before it happens. Can you talk a little bit abou t your decision to take\nthis historic step of holding a news conf erence after a Fed meeting—why you chose to do it;\nwhat anxieties you may have ha d about doing it; and how, say, f acing the media compares to\nfacing Congress.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks, mom [la ughing]. Well, the Federal Reserve has\nbeen looking for ways to increase its transparen cy now for many years, and we’ve made a lot of\nprogress. It used to be that the mystique of central banki ng was all about not letting anybody\nknow what you were doing. As recently as 1994, th e Federal Reserve didn’t even tell the public\nwhen it changed the target for the federal funds rate. Since then, we have taken a number of\nsteps. A statement, which includes a vote. We have—we produce very detailed minutes which\nare released only three weeks af ter the meeting, which is essen tially a production lag. We now\nprovide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook. We\nhave substantial means of communicating throu gh speeches, testimony, and the like. And so we\nhave become, I think, a very—a very transparen t central bank. That being said, we had a\nsubcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparen cy and accountability. And the press conference\nwas—came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice\nincludes now—many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with\nthem. And, secondly, it does provide a chance for th e Chairman, in this case, to provide some\nadditional color and context for both—in this cas e both the meeting and the projections that are\n\nbeing made by the Committee. So we thought it wa s a natural next step. We’re not done. We’re\ncontinuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more\naccountable. But we think this is the right way to go. And I personally have always been a big\nbeliever in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you’re\ndoing, to help the markets understand what you’re doing, and to be accountable to the public for\nwhat you’re doing. Now, of course, the Fed di dn’t do this for a long time. And I think the\ncounterargument has always been that, if ther e was a risk, that the Chairman speaking might\ncreate unnecessary volatility in financial market s or may not be necessary, given all the other\nsources of—of information that come out of the Federal Reserve. It was our judgment, after\nthinking about this for some time, that at this point, the additional benefits from more\ninformation, more transparency, meeting the pres s directly, outweigh some of these—some of\nthese risks. And I think, over time, you know, we’ll e xperiment to try to make sure that this is as\neffective a venue as possible.\nQUESTION. Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at\n800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot\nlonger for the economy to recover. Are people e xpecting too much from the Federal Reserve in\nterms of helping the economy recover? And has that complicated your m onetary policymaking?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, let me just sa y, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate\nschool classmate of mine, so I’ve known him for a long time. I’ve even played chess against\nhim, which was a big mistake. And I enjoye d that book very much. I thought it was very\ninformative. And as you say, it makes a point that , as an historical ma tter, that recoveries\nfollowing financial crises tend to be relativel y slow. Now, what th e book didn’t really do,\nthough, was given a full explanation of why that’s th e case. Certainly, part of it has to do with\n\nthe problems in credit markets, and my own re search when I was in academia focused a great\ndeal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries. Other as pects would include the\neffects of credit problems on areas like housing a nd so on. And we’re seeing all that, of course,\nin our economy. But that said, another possible e xplanation for the slow recovery from financial\ncrises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they—tha t the recapitalization of\nthe banking system, the restoration of credit flow s, and monetary and fiscal policies were not\nsufficient to get—to get as quick a recovery as might otherwise have been possible. And so, you\nknow, we haven’t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a\nstrong recovery. That being sa id, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons\nfor that. Credit factors are one. Another very important factor is that, you know, this was\ntriggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak. And\nunder normal circumstances, construction, both re sidential and nonresiden tial, would be a big\npart of the recovery process. And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high\noil prices and other things. There are a numbe r of factors which are holding—which are holding\nthe recovery back. So there are good reasons for why the recovery is slower than we would like.\nAt the same time, it’s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient. Conditions\nare far from where they—where we would lik e them to be. The combination of high\nunemployment, high gas prices, a nd high foreclosure rates is a te rrible combination. A lot of\npeople are having a very tough time. So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.\nAnd I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery proc ess looks likely to continue to\nbe a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the—of the rece ssion, I do think that the\npace will pick up over time. And I am very conf ident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will\nreturn to being the most productive—one of th e fastest growing and dynamic economies in the\n\nworld. And it hasn’t lost any of the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in\nthe world before the crisis, and I think we’ll return to that status as we recover.\nThank you very much, and thank you for coming."
