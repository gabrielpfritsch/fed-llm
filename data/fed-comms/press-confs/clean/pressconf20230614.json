  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nWe understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stabilit y is the responsibility of the\nFederal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn ’t work for anyone. In particular,\nwithout price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early l ast year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points , and we ’ve continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects\nof our tightening have yet to be felt . In light of how far we ’ve come in tightening policy, the\nuncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from\ncredit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as\nlikely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. A nd I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last yea r, and r ecent indicators suggest that\neconomic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace . Although growth in consumer\nspending has picked up this year, a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Committee partic ipants generally expect subdued\n\ngrowth to continue. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real\nGDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains\naveraged a robust 283,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but rema ined low\nin May at 3. 7 percent. T here are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are\ncoming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs -to-workers gap has\ndeclined , labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC\nparticipants expect supply and demand condi tions in the labor market to come into better balance\nover time, easing upward pressures on inflation . The median unemployment rate projection in\nthe SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next yea r.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal. Over the 12 months ending\nin April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4. 4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4. 7 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer\nprice index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent. Inflation\nhas moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year. Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation\n\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and price —and stable prices for the A merican people. My colleagues and I are\nacutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attent ive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year , we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage\npoints. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest\nrate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time,\nhowever, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially o n inflation.\nThe economy is fac ing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and\nbusinesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of\nthese effects remains uncertain.\nIn light of how far we ’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings .\nAs I noted earlier, nearly , nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be\nappropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But a t this meeting,\nconsidering how far and how fast we ’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range\nsteady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary\n\npolicy. I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\nIn our SEP, participant s wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path\nfor the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario\ngoing forward. If the economy evolves as pr ojected, the median participant projects that the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent\nat the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. For the end of this year, the median\nprojection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections. I hasten to add, as\nalways, that t hese projections are not a Committee decision or plan . If the economy does not\nevolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-\nemployment and price -stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by\nmeeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks .\nWe remain committed to bring ing inflation —bringing inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keep ing longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the countr y. Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.\n\nWe will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. And I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times . I’m curious what\ngives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time\nwhen the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated. Interest rate –sensitive sectors like\nhousing, w hile they ’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some\nregions , and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the be ginning of this\ntightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes earl y last year, we said there\nwere three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence —that of the speed of\ntightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we ’d\nneed to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how\nfast to move rates up , and we moved very quickly by historical standards. Then last December,\nafter four consecut ive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50 —of a 50 basis point\nhike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.\nSo it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to\nour destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold\nrates steady at this meeting, I would just say it ’s a continuation of , of that process. The main\nissue that we’ re focused on now is determining the extent of additional poli cy firming that may\nbe appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time —so that the pace of the increases and the\nultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it —we have come. It may make\nsense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.\n\nI want to stress one more thing —and that is that the Committee decision made today was\nonly about this meeting. We didn’ t make any decision about going forward, including what\nwould happen at the next meeting, including—we did not dec ide or really discuss anything about\ngoing to an every- other -meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach. We really\nwere focused on what to do at this meeting.\nCOLBY SMITH . So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—\nany sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?\nCHAIR POWELL. So again, we didn’ t—we didn’ t make a decision about July. I mean,\nof course, it, it came up in the —in the meeting from time to time. But really, the focus was, was\non what to do today. I would say about, about July two things : (1) [the] decision hasn ’t been\nmade , (2) I do expect that it will be a “ live” meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. I was just\nwondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’ s\nbeen a level shift in the —in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower\nprogress on inflation. And I ’m wondering in, in this sort of —where ’s the disinflation coming\nfrom?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. The labor market ’s going to be stronger it looks like —it’s not\ncoming from the re. Demand ’s not coming down all that fast. According to GDP —you’ve\ndoubled your , your estimate of GDP. So what ’s the—what ’s the narrative here? It seems like\nit’s getting more “immaculate ,” rather than more messy.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So you ’re, you’ re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent\nwith, but on the high side of , expectations. A nd if you go back to the old —the former SEP—the\nlast SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved\nup. These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit. Unemployment estimates\nmove d down a bit . Inflation estimates moved up a bit. And, you know, all three of those kind of\npoint in the same direction —which is, you know, that perhaps more [mone tary policy] restraint\nwill be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So although the level, frankly, is , is\npretty —the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]\nfederal funds rate was trading bef ore the bank incidents of early March. So—but so we ’ve kind\nof gone back to that. So your question is , where ’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come\nfrom? And I, you know, I don’ t think the story has really changed.\nWe—the C ommittee has consistentl y said and believed that the process of getting\ninflation down is going to be a gradual one. It ’s going to take some time. And I think you go\nback to the —to the three -part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation —which is, we think,\nas good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward. You start with goods.\nWith goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions —supply- side conditions.\nThey ’ve definitely improved a substantial amou nt, but if you talk to people in business, they will\nsay it ’s not back to where it was. So that ’s, that ’s one thing. And that should enable goods\nprices to continue —goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.\nIn terms of housing services inflation —that ’s another big piece. And , and you are seeing\nthere that new rents in new , new leases are, are coming in at low levels. And it ’s really a matter\nof time as that goes through the pipeline. In fact, I think any forecast that people are makin g\nright now about inflation coming down this year will , will contain a big dose of —this year and\n\nnext year —will contain a , a good amount of , of disinflation [com ing] from that source. And , and\nthat’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [ previously have expected it to come\ninto] effect.\nThat leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half , pardon me, of\nthe—of core PCE inflation that ’s not housing services. And, you know, we see only the earliest\nsigns of disinfl ation there. It’ s a sector —it’s a very broad and diverse sector. I would say [that,]\nin a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost. I t’s the service\nsector , so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive. And I think many analysts would say that the key to\ngetting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions —which\nwe have seen. We have actually seen , you know —I go through a number of indicators\nsuggesting there has been some loos ening in labor market conditions. We need to see that\ncontinue.\nI would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation\ndown are, are coming into place . And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below\ntrend. It would be a labor market that’ s loosening. It would be goods pipelines getting healthier\nand healthier and that kind of thing. There, there —the things are in place that we need to see,\nbut the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell, what ’s the\nvalue in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now ? I mean, not to be\nflippant, but I don’ t lose weight just by buying a gym m embership —I have to actually go to the\ngym. Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year -end ’23 rate today. A majority of you\n\nthink you’ re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year. So why not just rip off the\nBand -Aid and raise rates to day?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the —first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate\nquestion from the question—from the —from, from that of level. Okay. So —and I think if you\nlook at the SEP, that is our estimate —our individual —it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our\nindividual estimates of how far to go. I , I mentioned how , how we got to those numbers . In\nterms of speed, it ’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is , speed was very important last\nyear. As we get closer and closer to t he destination—and, according to the SEP, we ’re not so far\naway from the destination , in most people ’s accounting —it’s, it’s reasonable—it ’s common\nsense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every\nmeeti ng. And so the C ommittee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if\nonly slightly .\nThen there are benefits to that. So that gives us more information to make decisions. We\nmay try to make better decisions. I think it allows the ec onomy a little more time to adapt as\nwe—as we make our decisions going forward , and we ’ll get to see, you know —we haven ’t\nreally —we don’ t know the full extent of , of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we ’ve\nseen. We, we—i t would be early to see those, but we don’ t know what the extent is. We’ ll have\nsome more time to see that unfold. I mean, it ’s, it’s just the idea that we ’re trying to get this\nright. And this is —if you think of the two things as separate variables , then I think —I think that\nthe skip— I shouldn’ t call it a skip —the , the decision makes sense.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I know you said July is live . With only one June employment —with\nonly the June e mployment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July\nmeeting —you ge t the ECI after, you get the S enior L oan O fficer S urvey after , you get some\n\nbank earnings at the end of next month—w hat incremental information will the C ommittee be\nusing to inform their judgment on whether this is , in fact, a skip or a , a longer pause?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think you’ re adding that to the , the data that we’ ve seen since\nthe last meeting, too. You know, we —since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it ’ll\nreally be a three- month period of data that we can look at. And I think that’s a full quarter, and I\nthink you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six —any six -\nweek period.\nWe’ll look at those things. We’ ll also look at the evolving risk picture. We’ll look at\nwhat ’s happening in the financial sector. We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and\nwe’ll make a decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions . Jeanna Smialek , New York\nTimes . You obviously, in your forecasts , marked up the sort of path for growth, mark ed down\nthe path for unemployment , and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably. I wonder, you\nknow , since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’ s a lot more resilient\nand inflation is going to be a lot m ore stubborn? And given that, you know, why do you feel\nconfident that this is as high as you ’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate? Or do you\nthink it ’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this , this\ncycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I —I mean, on the first part, I just think we ’re following\nthe data and also the outlook. The economy is —the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if\nnot all , analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really. And it ’s,\nit’s just remarkable. And that ’s really, if you think about it —that ’s what ’s driving it. It ’s job\n\ncreation. It ’s, it’s wages moving up. It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting\nhiring. And it ’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is —that is driving the economy. And so\nit’s, it’s really the , the data . In terms of, you know —we , we always write down at these\nmeetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year. That ’s,\nthat’s how we do it. It ’s based on our , our own individual assessments of what the most likely\npath of the economy is. It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.\nAnd, you know, there ’s really no way to know. But it ’s—it is —it’ s, it’s what people think as of\ntoday, and as the —as the data come in, it , it can move around during the intermeeting period. It\ncould wind up back in the same place. But it really will be data driven. I can ’t—I can ’t tell you\nthat that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—w here the federal funds rate\nwill be that far in advance.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question. You had said back at\nthe end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance. Is that s till the\ncase, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there? And also, could you give us\nan idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate? Is the —obviously, the current rate,\naccording to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive . Is it 5.6? Is it 6? Where is\nsufficiently restrictive ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I, I would say again that I think that , over time, the\nbalance of risks, as we move from very, you know —from interest rates that are effectively zero\nnow to 5 percentage points with , with an SEP calling for additional hikes —I think we ’ve moved\nmuch closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate , and I think that means\nby—almost by def inition that the —that the risks of , of sort of overdoing it and under ,\n\nunderdoing it are , are getting closer to being in balance. I still think , and my, my colleagues\nagree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still. So we don’ t—we don’ t think we ’re\nthere with inflation yet because we ’re just looking at the data. And if you look at the —at the full\nrange of , of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just —you just aren’ t seeing a lot of\nprogress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but , as you\nknow, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going .\nSufficiently —so I think, you know , what , what we ’d like to see is credible evidence that\ninflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That ’s, that ’s what we want to see—\nof course that ’s what we want to see. And I , I think it ’s—it’s also—we understand that there are\nlags, but remember th at it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening. I\nthink it ’s—I think the reason we ’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the\ntightening took place over last summer and later into the year. And I think it ’s, it’s reasonable to\nthink that some of that may come into effect. So we ’re, you know —I think stretching out into a\nmore moderate pace is appropriate to , to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you\nknow, more —with more data over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post . Thanks\nfor taking our questions. I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’ re considering\nwhen you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would\nexpect to kick in as those lag effects come , come into effect that would inform your decisions?\nHave you learned things over t he past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to\nexpect those lags to come into effect?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So it ’s a—it’ s a challenging thing in, in economics. It’s, it’s\nsort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable\nlags. Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes. So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off—by the time we had lifted off , the two -year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of\nwhere [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.\nSo in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where —\nwhere news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire. So that ’s, that ’s\ndifferent. But it ’s still the case that what you see i s interest -sensitive spending is affected very,\nvery quickly —so housing, and durable goods , and things like that . But broader demand , and\nspending, and, and asset values, and things like that —they just take longer.\nAnd you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on\nthat. So there ’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it ta kes. So, you\nknow, then that makes it challenging, of course. So we ’re, we’re looking at the calendar. We’re,\nwe’re looking at what ’s happening in the economy. We’ re having to make these judgments.\nAgain, i t’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate\npace now as we seek that , that ultimate —I can ’t point to —that ultimate endpoint. I can ’t point to\na specific data point. I think we ’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really\nflattening out reliably and then starting to soften. I think we ’ll know that we ’re—that it’ s\nworking. A nd, ideally , by, by taking a little more time, we won ’t go well past the level where we\nneed to go.\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’ re seeing\non credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’ re teasing that out apart\nfrom these lag effects.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s, it’s too early still to , to try to assess the full extent of what\nthat might mean. And, you know , that ’s something we ’re going to be watching, of course. And,\nyou know, if we were to see what , what we would view as significant tightening beyond what\nwould normally be expected because of , of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that\ninto acc ount on, on—in , in making rate decisions. So that ’s, that ’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned that\nmany of the trends are in place that you want to see —core services ex. housing has come in\npretty low in the past couple of months. And , as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation\nis now housing prices. And then we ’ve had some quirks in used- car prices.\nSo given that these trends are in place, I guess I ’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick ’s\nquestion : Why signal additional rate hikes? Aren ’t things headed in the direction you need?\nWhy not simply give it even more time? Or —it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the\ndots, given what w e’re seeing recently.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So, you know, we ’ve—remember, we ’ve—we’re two and a\nhalf years into this —or two and a quarter years into this. And forecasters, including Fed\nforecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to tu rn down and, you know,\ntraditional— you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.\nSo I think if you—I think if you look at the —at core PC E inflation overall—look at it\nover the last six months —you’ re just not seeing a lot of progress. It’s running, and it ’s running\n\nat a level, you know, over 4½ percent —far above our , our target and not really, you know,\nmoving down. We want to see it moving down decisively. That ’s all. We’re, you know, of\ncourse, we ’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time. We, we don’ t want to do—we ,\nwe want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.\nBut we have to get inflation down to 2 percent , and we will. And we just don’ t see that\nyet. So , hence, you see toda y’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by\nthe end of this year but also to, you know, to take —to, to moderate somewhat the pace with\nwhich we ’re moving.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Q uick follow -up. I mean, the last press conference you mentioned\nyou didn’ t see wages driving inflation. And, you know, there was some research from the San\nFrancisco Fed suggesting wages aren ’t necessarily a key driver. But you’ ve talked about the\nlabor market today and the need for softening. Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how\nyou see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I ’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,\nbut I, I would say that the —I think the over all picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early\n2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for —largely for goods. People\nwere still at home . They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on\ngoods.\nAnd, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,\nsupply chains got all snarled up. So prices went way up. Inflation went way up. So that was\nthe, the origin , and it wasn’ t really particularly about the labor market or wages. B ut as you—as\nyou moved into—through ’ 21, into ’22, and now in ’ 23, I think many, many analysts believe that\nit will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing\n\nservices sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with\n2 percent inflation.\nWe actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace. So —\nand that ’s, you know, that ’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a\nfew weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I , I would think.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKE E. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. You said\nin the past that you don’ t like to surprise markets. It’ s kind of been the Fed’ s view markets\nshould have an idea of what you’ re going to do before you go in. You also said a number of\ntimes that it would take a while to bring inflation down. You reiterated that again today and that\nwe, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.\nSo I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should\nlook at your reacti on function. What will you be reacting to —time or data? In other words, if\nnothing much changes —if we ’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of\ninflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ ve said you\nfeel you need to? Is it time that’ s going to require additional movement , or would it be reversal\nin inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I don’ t want to deal with , with hypotheticals about different\nways data might move. And so, we, you know —we of course —we ’re not —we don’ t go out of\nour way to surprise markets or the public. At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right. And that ’s, that ’s wha t we’re doing here , and that ’s what we ’ll do for the\nupcoming meetings.\n\nI will say the July meeting will be “ live,” and we ’ll just have to see. I think you’ ll, you’ ll\nsee the data, you’ ll hear Fed people talking about it , and, and markets will have to make a—\nmake a judgment.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down\nbased on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a\nperiod where we ’re not going to know what ’s happening?\nCHAIR P OWELL. You know, I , I think if you look at —if, if you just look at —I’ll just\npoint you to the forecast. So inflation is running —core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a\nlittle higher than 4½ percent. And the , the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to\n3.9 on a 12- month basis. This is by the end of this year.\nSo that ’s expecting pretty substantial progress. That ’s, that’s a pretty significant decline\nfor half a year. So that ’s, that’s the forecast. You know, we ’ll—we do try to be transparent in\nour reaction function. W e’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down. And that ’s the\nnumber -one thing. So that ’s how I thin k about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. Could you talk about the balance\nsheet and how you’ re thinking about it? What , what are you looking for to judge whether we ’re\napproaching reserve scarcity? And is Treasury issuance going to affect that? Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it— if I can talk\nabout that and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that —of course , we’ve been very\nfocused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly. I think we all saw —I saw the Secretary ’s comments yesterday to the\n\neffect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid\nmarket disruption and that they ’re going to watch carefully for that.\nSo that ’s, that ’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, y ou know, the , the\nborrowings . At the Fed , we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills\nthe, the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves. It’s really hard to say at the —at the beginning of this which will\nbe—which will be greater.\nWe are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take -up, for\nthat matter —so we don’ t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over\nthe course of the year. So that ’s, that ’s—that ’s the—that ’s the Treasury part of the answer. We\nwill, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we ’re prepared to make\nadjustments to make sure that , that monetary policy transmission works.\nWas there another part of your question?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Yeah —are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take\nsome pressure off banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , we have a number of —I would say the [ON] RRP [facility ]\ndoesn’ t look like it’ s, it’s pulling money out of —out of the banking system. It’ s actually been\nshrinking here lately. So I don’ t think —that ’s not something, something we ’ve thought about a\nlot over time . It doesn ’t really look like that ’s, that ’s som ething that we would do. I think it ’s—I\nthink it ’s a tool that we have.\nIf we want to use it, we can. There are other tools we can —we can use to address money\nmarket issues. But I wouldn’ t say that that’ s something that ’s likely that we would do in the near\nterm.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. Have you seen sufficient\ncooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? For example, how does the recent\nrebound affect your forecasts , and how does it fact or into monetary policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So certainly housing—very interest sensitive , and it ’s the first place,\nreally, or one of the first places , that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by\nhigher rates. And we certainly saw that o ver the course of the last year. We now see housing\nputting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.\nYou know, we ’re watching that situation carefully. I do think we —we will see rents ,\nrents and , and house prices filtering into , into housing se rvices inflation. And I , I don’ t see them\ncoming up quickly. I, I do see them kind of —kind of wandering around at a relatively low level\nnow, and that ’s appropriate.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Do you think you’ ll have to target that with further rate increases?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we , we look at everything. We don’ t just look at\nhousing. So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and —including their most likely\nforecasts— including their rate forecast. And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we\ncumulate it, and then we publish it for you.\nSo that ’s how —that ’s how they do that. Well, I don’t know that housing is , is itself\ngoing to be driving the rates picture, but it ’s part of it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward\nLawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about , in the past ,\n\nabout unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in\n10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033. At what point do you talk more firmly w ith lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because —assuming monetary\npolicy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher -level\nspending.\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’ t do that. That’s really not my job. We—we hope and expect\nthat other policymakers will respect our independence on , on monetary policy. And we don’ t see\nourselves as, as , you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy. I will say, and many of my\npredecessors have said , that we ’re on an unsus tainable fiscal path and , and that needs to be\naddressed over time. But I think trying to get into , into that with lawmakers would be —would\nbe kind of inappropriate , given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Is there any conversation then about the F ederal Reserve\nfinancing some of that debt that we ’re seeing coming down the pike?\nCHAIR POWELL. No . Under no circumstances.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks for taking our questions , Chair Powell. So looking at\nthe SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly —your forecast for GDP this\nyear. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward. And so should we take that as a sign that the C ommittee is more confident about the pros pects of a soft landing —at least\nmore —at least as it relates to what you were expecting in , in March ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know , I—I would just say it this way. I continue to think —and\nthis really hasn ’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent\nwithout having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ ve\n\nseen in so many past instances. It ’s, it’s possible . A—in a way, a strong labor market is —that ,\nthat gradually cools could, could aid that along— it could aid that along. But I , I guess I want to\ncome back to the , the main thing, which is , though, simply this. We, we see—the C ommittee —\nas you can see from the SEP, the C ommittee is completely unified in the need to get inflation\ndown to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time. That is our\nplan. And, you know, we , we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the —in\nthe U .S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’ s\nworkers and families and businesses but also for the future. Getting price stability back and , and\nrestored will benefit generations of people as long as it ’s sustained. And it really is the bedrock\nof the economy. And , and you should understand that that is our top priority.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Just a quick follow -up on that. I’m just a little confused\nbecause you said the C ommittee will do whatever it takes to get in flation down over time , but\nwhen I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate\nis lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, you know, if you look two and three years out with , with\nthe forecast —first of all, I wouldn ’t—I wouldn’ t put too much weight on forecasts even one year\nout because they’ re, they ’re so highly uncertain. But what they’ re showing is that as inflation\ncomes down in the —in the forecast, if you don’ t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually\ngoing up, r ight? So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,\nlet’s say —should come down just to maintain real rates. And i f—and actually, you know, since\nwe’re, we’re probably going to—we ’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be\nmeaningfully positive and significantly . So for us to get inflation down, t hat probably means —\nthat, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is\n\ncoming down really significantly. And again, we ’re talking about a couple of years out. I think ,\nas, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor\ndo I think it is at all likely to be appropriate , if you think about it. Inflation has not really moved\ndown. It has —it ha s not so far reacted much to our —to our existing rate hikes. And so we ’re\ngoing have to keep at it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Julie.\nJULIE CHABANAS. I ’m sorry. Thank you. Hi , Chair Powell. Julie Chabanas, AFP\nNews Agency. The May job report showed a rebound in May in the B lack workers ’\nunemployment. Is it consistent with the Fed ’s maximum -employment mandate? Are you\nworried about that —about this rebound?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we are, of course, worried about —there are—there are long -\nstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across , across our labor market. That ’s a factor\nthat we don’ t—we can ’t really address with our tools. But we do conside r that when we ’re\nthinking about what constitutes maximum employment —it is, for us , a broad and inclusive goal.\nAnd so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,\nhas been bouncing around right near historic lows —histo ric modern lows here. So we ’re still\ntalking about , I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ ve seen in , you know, a half -\ncentury here in the United States. So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent i s, is higher —three -\ntenths higher than it was measured to be at the last —a month ago. But , still, it’ s extraordinarily\nlow. And so it ’s a very, very tight labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent\nquestion on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how —I’ll back up. W e haven’ t\n\nquite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet. And we did hear Governor Waller talk\nabout how an uptick in housing might mean that there ’s not going to be as much relief coming or\na shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you’ re thinking about that and\nhow that played into today’ s outcome?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t say—that ’s, you know —as a factual matter, t hat’s correct.\nWe do need to see, you know , rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their\nincreases because we want —we want t he, you know, we want inflation to come down. And\nrental is , is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PC E.\nSo it’s important. And so we ’re—it’s something that we ’re watching very carefully. It’s part of\nthe overall picture. I wouldn’ t say it ’s the decisive part, but take a step back. What you see is—\nlook at —look at core inflation over the past six months, a year. You ’re just not seeing a lot of\nprogress —not the kind of progress we want to see. And that , that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.\nAnd, you know, the C ommittee —people on the C ommittee —the median went up significantly,\nso that the median participant now thinks that core PC E inflation on a 12 -month basis will be\n3.9 percent this year. So , once again, every year for the past three years, it ’s gone up over the\ncourse of the year , and that ’s doing that again. So we see that , and we see that inflation forecasts\nare coming in low again, and we see that —that that tells us that we need to do more. And so\nwe’re—that ’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.\nMEGAN CAS SELLA. Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages a nd,\ngiven the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think w ages might\nneed to fall in order to get inflation back in line ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages will continue to increase. So we , we, you know —what\nwe’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that ’s\n\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And so I , I think we ’ve seen some progress—all,\nall of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated— not\nextremely elevated —highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’ re, they ’re moving back\ndown but , but quite gradually. And , and, you know, we want to see that , that process continue\ngradually. Of course, it ’s great to see wage increases, particularly for peo ple at the lower end of\nthe income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to\n2 percent , which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone\nelse. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst , and the fastest , by high inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you so much, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just\nwondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and , and—there, there ’s\nstrikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike. I\nmean, aren ’t workers —they have —we have some—workers have power now and a re going to be\nseeking higher wages. Does t hat come up in your discussions ? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor\nmarket could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything. I mean, i t’s, it’s\nvery—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central. You know, it ’s half\nof our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think, you know, we —there ,\nthere are structural issues that are really not for the Fed. And so we don’ t spend a lot of time —\nalthough we take notice of , of what ’s going on, but we ’re not , you know —we ’re not involved in\ndiscussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that. But we—you know, we , we look,\nand we see what ’s going on. And, you know, we ’re making judgments about what it will take to\nget inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate. And as I said, don’ t think that was about —I\n\ndidn’ t—most folks would say now it wasn ’t really about that —about wages at the beginning.\nAnd it ’s becoming more about that as we —as we get into really service- sector inflation, which is\nthe part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Mark for the las t question.\nMARK HAMRICK . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.\nWondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk n ow that we ’re about three months\npast the failure of Silicon Valley Bank . And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with\ncommercial real estate as well as nonbank financials? And could you further elevate those risks\nwith higher still rates, possibly for longer?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I ’m trying to think where to start. I’ll sta rt with commercial real\nestate. We —of course, we ’re watching that situation very carefully. There ’s a substantial\namount of commercial real estate in the banking system. A , a large part of it is in smaller banks.\nIt’s well distributed —to the extent it ’s well distributedthen , then the system could, could take\nlosses. We do expect that there will be losses, but they ’ll be—the y’ll be banks that have\nconcentrations , and those banks will experience larger losses. So we ’re well aware of that.\nWe’re monitor ing it carefully. You know, it feels like —it feels like something that will be\naround for some time , as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you\nknow, work its way into systemic risk.\nIn terms of nonbank financials —financial sector —there ’s been a ton of work. And, you\nknow, clearly in the —in the pandemic, it really was —it was the nonbank financial sector w here,\nwhere issues really arose. And, you know, there ’s a lot of work going on in—with the\nAdministration , in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and , and\nin all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market. And —but, you know, our jurisdiction at\n\nthe Fed is over banks —actually bank holding companies and some banks. So that ’s, that’s really\nour main focus .\nYou know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully\nmonitoring that situation. You know, our , our job generally involves worrying about a lot of\nthings that may go wrong, and that would i nclude the banks. It might be hard for me to identify\nsomething that we don’ t worry about rather than that we do worry about. So we ’re watching\nthose things very carefully. And as we see things unfold—as we see what ’s happening with\ncredit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we ’ll be able\nto take , to the extent it ’s appropriate , we can take, if they ’re macroeconomic implications, we\ncan take that into account in our rate setting. And so I guess that ’s what I would say.\nMARK HAMRICK . Can I just follow up on the last part of that? Do you—do you risk\nfurther exacerbat ing those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s—and, and I was —I guess I meant to address that by saying\nas we—as we watch, we’ ll see what ’s happening. And if we —if we ’re seeing the kind of\ntightening of conditions that , that you could be referring to, then we can factor that —because\nreally, we ’re—we use our —our rate tool is , is, you know, is —it really has macroeconomic\npurposes. So we ’ll, we ’ll take that into account. Of course, we have responsibility for financial\nstability as well. And that also is a factor that we’ re always going to be considering.\nThank you very much."
