  "text": "December 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nAs we approach the end of the year, it ’s natural to look back on the progress that has been\nmade toward our dual -mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment. That ’s very good news. But inflation is still too\nhigh, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. As\nwe look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to\nreturning inflation to our 2 pe rcent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into\nrestrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity\nand inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.\nToday, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce\nour securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that\nwe face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any\nadditional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewi ng economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from\nthe outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\n2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving\nsupply conditions. After picking somewhat over the —up somewhat over the summer, activity in\nthe housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) , Committee participants\nrevised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the\nsupply of workers . The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly\nfor individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and imm igration has returned to pre -pandemic levels.\nNominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although\nthe jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available\nworkers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.\nBased on the c onsumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and\nenergy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nThe lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need\nto see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our\ngoal.\nLonger -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a\nbroad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation\nall the way to 2 percent will take some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly , highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe are strongly committed to returning inf lation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage\npoints, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive\nstance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWhile we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,\nthe economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress —sorry —ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. We\nare prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We ’re committed to achieving a stance of\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nmonetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent\nover time and to keeping policy restrictive until we ’re confident that inflation is on a path to that\nobjective.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the en d of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and\n2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer -term rate.\nThese projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve\nas projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment\nand price -stability goals.\nIn light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is\nproceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the\ntotality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy\nfirming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will\ntake into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -\nterm inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Chris Rugaber .\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I wanted\nto ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “ any” before “ additional . . . firming ” in\nthe statement ? I mean , does that mean that you ’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the\nCommittee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So —specifically on “any” : We do say that “ in determining the\nextent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate ,” so “any additional policy\nfirming ”—that sentence. So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe\nthat we are likely at or near the , the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn’t write down\nadditional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down. But participants also didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table. So that’s really what we were\nthinking.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. Fed\nGovernor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several\nmonths could be cutting interest rates. I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn ’t cut\nrates if inflation fell. Thank you, sir.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, I don’ t comment on , on any other officials, even those\nwho work at the F ed. But I ’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly. So the way—\nthe way we’re looking at it is , is really this. When we started out, right, we said the first question\nis, how fast to move, and we moved very fast. The second question is, you know, really, how\nhigh to raise the policy rate ? And that ’s really the question that we ’re still on here. We ’re, we’re\nvery focused on that , as I—as I mentioned. P eople generally think that we ’re at or n ear that and ,\nand think it ’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’ t take that possibility off the table.\nSo that ’s—when you get to that question, and that ’s your answer, there ’s a natural —naturally , it\nbegins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back\nthe amount of policy restraint that’ s in place.\nSo that ’s really the next question, and that ’s what people are thinking about and, and\ntalking about. And I would just say this . We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that\nappears to be moderating ; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so\nmany measures; and we ’re seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we’ ve\nbeen wanting to see. We can ’t know . We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory.\nThat would be premature . And we can ’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing] . So we ’re,\nwe’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. And\nthat’s, that’s really the question that we ’re on. B ut, of course, the other question, the question of\nwhen will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion —topic of discussion out in the\nworld and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?\nThank you.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So it , it comes up in this way today. Everybody wrote down\nan SEP forecast . So many people mentioned what their —what their rate forecast was . And there\nwas no back -and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like , “This is what I wrote down ;\nthis is what I think, ” that kind of thing, a nd a preliminary kind of a discussion like that. N ot\neverybody did that, but many people did. And then, and I would say, there ’s a general\nexpectation that this will be —this will be a topic for us , looking ahead. That, t hat’s really what\nhappened in today’ s meeting. I can ’t do the head count for you in real time . But that ’s generally\nwhat happened today.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi , Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post . Thanks\nfor taking our questions. At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a\nrecession and isn ’t heading for one now ? And if the answer is “ no,” I’m curious about what\nyou’d still be looking for. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you can say that there ’s little basis for thinking that the\neconomy is in a recession now. I would say that.\nI think there ’s, there’s always a probability that , that there will be a recession in the next\nyear, and it ’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it ’s always a\nreal possibility. The question is, is it —so it ’s a possibility here. I have always felt, since the\nbeginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that ’s what we ’re\nseeing. That ’s what many forecasters , on and off the C ommittee , are seeing. This result is not\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nguaranteed. It is—it is far to o early to declare victory . And there are certainly risks. It’s\ncertainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way. It has done that\nrepeatedly through the post —in the post -pandemic period. Nonetheless, where we are is, is we\nsee the things that I —that I mentioned.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I ’m curious , if you ’re looking back on the past year, you talked\nabout “ navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.” Can you talk about some of the ways in\nwhich the economy surprised you most this year , where you thought it would behave in one way\nand had to pivot to respond? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very\nbroadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023 . And not only did that not happen—that\nincludes F ed forecasters and really , essentially , all forecasters ; a very high proportion of\nforecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession —not only did that not happen, we actually\nhad a very strong year, and that was a combination of , of strong demand but also of real gains on\nthe supply side.\nSo this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked\nup, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic —you know, the shortages\nand the bottlenecks —really began to unwind. So we had significant supply- side gains with\nstrong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent -plus, or a little more than that , growth\nyear at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just\nbecause of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody.\nI think the inflation forecast is roughly , roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but\nin a very different setting . And I would say the labor market , because of the stronger growth, has\nalso been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nsignificant increase in , in unemployment. It didn ’t really happen. We’ re still at 3.7 percent. So\nwe’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that ’s coming back into\nbalance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It ’s a— you\nknow, that ’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for\ntaking the questions. I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what —on what\nmotivates the lower rates next year, whether it’ s a coincidence, for example, that the spread\nbetween PC E inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.\nAre you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you ’re expecting, in\nthe rate of inflation that you ’re expecting as o pposed to supporting the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is , is a\nbottoms -up—built from the bottom up, right ? So I think people are looking at what ’s happening\nin the economy. A nd I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is\nthat] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,\nreally significantly in three months. That’s a big piece of , of this. At the same time, [real GDP]\ngrowth has turned out to be very stro ng in the third quarter . [Now it] is slowing, we believe, as ,\nas appropriate . And we’ve got —we ’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,\nsignificant progress toward greater balance across a very —a broad range of indicators. You’re\nseeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them. But so I think that\npeople look at that, and they write down their —basically, each individual writes down a forecast\nand a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and , and publish it. And s o it’s\nnot—it isn ’t—you ask about real rates, I take it ?\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. Y ou know, that’s —that is —that is something that we ’re very\nconscious of , and aware of , and monitor, and it ’s certainly a big part of —it’s a part of how we\nthink about things . But, really , it’s broader financial conditions that matter. And , as you well\nknow, it ’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the —what the real rate is or exactly how\ntight policy is at any given time. So you couldn’ t follow that like it was a rule and think that you\nwould get the right answer all the time, but it’ s certainly something that we ’re focused on . And,\nindeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is\ndeclining as we—as we move forward.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has , has\nalready kind of begun. I ’m wondering, just related to, to Steve ’s question, how the —how the\ntactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into\n2024, the closer you get to a presidential election. Do you want to front -load this, in other\nwords?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. No , we—we’re —we don’ t think about political events. We\ndon’t think about politics. We think about what ’s the right thing to do for the economy. The\nminute we start thinking about those things —you know, we just can’ t do that. We have to think,\nwhat ’s the right thing ? We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time\nwe—when we think is the right time. That ’s what we ’ll always do.\nSo I mentioned we ’re moving carefully. One of the things we ’re moving carefully about\nis that decision over —that assessment, really —over whether , whether we’ve done enough,\nreally. And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes. That ’s, that’s us thinking that\nwe have done enough but not , not feeling that really strongly , confidently and not wanting to\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\ntake the possibility of a rate hike off the table. Nonetheless, it ’s not the base case anymore,\nobviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago. So that ’s, that’s how we’re —that’s how we’re\napproaching things . And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks\nabout —people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start\nto dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that ’s a discussion we’ ll be having\ngoing forward. But that ’s another a ssessment that we’ re going to make very carefully, so as time\ngoes forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you ’ve\nargued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the\nmarket anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf. The market is now easing policy\non your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that ’s a full point below the\ncurrent level , with cuts beginning around March. Is this something that you are broadly\ncomfortable with?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this last year has been remarkable for the , the sort of seesaw\nthing, the back -and-forth we ’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and\nmoving back and that kind of thing. So, and what I would just say is that we , we focus on what\nwe have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that ’s what we really\nfocus on. And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’ re going\nto—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’ t, you know . But in any case,\nwe have to do what we think is right.\nAnd, you know, in the long run, it ’s important that financial conditions become aligned\nor are aligned with what we ’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nbecause we will do what it takes to get to our goals. And , ultimately , that will mean that\nfinancial conditions will , will come along. But in the meantime, there can be back- and-forth,\nand, you know, I ’m just focused on what ’s the right thing for us to do. A nd my colleagues are\nfocused on that , too.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly. Do\nyou believe we ’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?\nCHAIR POWELL. Listen, I welcome the progress. I think it’ s, it’s really good to see the\nprogress that we ’re making. I think if you look at the 12- month—look at the 6-month measures,\nyou see very low numbers. If you look at 12- month measures, you’ re still well above 2 percent.\nYou’re actually above 3 percent on core , through November , PCE [inflation]. That isn ’t to say —\nI’m not, you know, calling into question the progress. It ’s great. We just need to see more. We\nneed to see, you know, continued further , further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.\nThat’s, that’s what we need to see.\nSo, you know, our —it’ s our job to restore price stability. And that —it’s one of our two\njobs, along with maximum employment, and they ’re equal. So we ’re very focused on, on, you\nknow, doing that. As I mentioned, we ’re moving carefully at this point. We’re pleased with the\nprogress, but , but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is\na lot of uncertainty about going forward. We’ ve seen the economy move in surprising\ndirections, so we ’re just going to need to see more further progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024. If\ngrowth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nexpected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates ? Or, put another way, is below -trend\ngrowth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing,\nso is inflation , so is labor market data. So we ’d, we’d look at the totality . As we—as we make\ndecisions about policy changes going forward, we ’re going to be look ing at all those things and,\nparticularly , about the—as they affect the outlook. So it ’s ultimately all about the outlook and\nthe balance of risk s as well. So that ’s what —that’s what we’d be looking for.\nIf we have stronger growth, you know, that ’ll be good for people. That ’ll be good for the\nlabor market. It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to\n2 percent. We will get it down to 2 percent, but , you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we\nwill set policy according to what we actually see . And, and so that ’s how I would answer.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. I guess the —I guess the question I ’m asking, if you don’ t mind a\nquick follow -up, I guess the question I ’m asking is, is above -trend growth itself a problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s only a problem inso— it’s not itself a problem. It ’s only a\nproblem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And, you know, if you\nhave —if you have growth that ’s robust , what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor\nmarket very strong. It probably will , will place some upward pressure on inflation. That could\nmean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation. That could mean we need to keep rates\nhigher for longer. It could even mean , ultimat ely, that we would need to hike again. It just is —\nit’s the way , the way our policy works.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi , Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. How do you interpret the state\nof the labor market right now ? And, in particular, you’ ve referred even today to evidence that\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nit’s coming into better balance. What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that\nbalance?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on, on the better- balance side, there are just a lot of things. It’s—\nyou see —you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels , given\npopulation growth and labor force participation. The things that are not quite —but let me go on\nwith that list. You know, claims are low. If you look at surveys of businesses, they ’re, they’re —\nsort of the era of this frantic labor shortage , [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and\nthey’ re seeing a shortage of lab or as being significantly alleviated. If you look at shortages of\nworkers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it ’d ever been or close to\nit, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures —participation,\nunemployment —so many measures: the unemployment —job openings, quits, all of those\nthings.\nSo wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation\nover a long period of time. They ’ve been gradually cooling off . But if wages are running around\n4 percent, that ’s still a bit above, I would say. And I guess there , there are just a couple of\nother —the unemployment rate is very, very low. And these are —but , but I would just say,\noverall , the development of the labor market has been very positive. It ’s been a good time for\nworkers to find jobs and get solid wage inc reases.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. You know, I ’d say the mood among\neconomists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat\ncorroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing. Yet when\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nwe—when we hear from the general public, there’ s a lot of discord about economic conditions.\nWhat do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policy makers ?\nCHAIR POWELL. It may be. A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,\nand that ’s very good news, the price level is not coming down. Prices of some , some goods and\nservices are coming down. B ut overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not . So people are\nstill living with high prices, and that ’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’ t like. And,\nyou know, so what will happen with that is , wages are now —[changes in] real wages are now\npositive . So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.\nAnd so that might help improve the mood of people.\nBut we do see those —we see those public opinion surveys. The thing that we can do is\nto do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits\nover such long periods of time , and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and\nachieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families\nand, and companies around the country.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask, you know, on,\non the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start\nto see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we ’re seeing now, how would you\nall think about that in terms of rate cuts? Would that be a sign that you ’ve, you’ve done your job\ndemand- wise?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry —if?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. If, if the economy starts to —looks like it ’s starting to fall into a\nrecession ; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s not something we ’re hoping to see. Obviously, we ’re hoping\nto, to see something very different —which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the\nlabor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment,\ninflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating without a significant increa se in unemployment. That ’s what we ’re, we’re trying very much to\nachieve and not something that we ’re looking to see.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, obviously, what we ’ll do is we ’ll look at the totality of\nthe data, as I ’ve mentioned a couple times, and , certainly, the labor data would be important in\nthat. And , you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the\nbeginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on that decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Mr.\nChairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight\ninflation, and you said earlier, again, “ the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been\nfelt.” How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’ re not behind the\ncurve there?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.\nYou know, w e know that that ’s a risk, and we ’re very focused on not making that mistake. And\nwe do regard the two— you know, we ’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of\noverdoing it and the risk of underdoing it. Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the —on\nthe price -stability mandate . And we ’re getting back to the point where —which is what you do\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nwhen you’ re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates —you’re getting now\nback to the point where both mandates are important, and they’ re, they’re more in balance , too.\nSo I think we ’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.\nAnd the things we ’ll be looking at, I ’ve already described. You know, we ’re, we’re\nobviously looking hard at what ’s happening with demand, and what we see ? We see the same\nthing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in\n2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year. And you see what the forecasts are. I think the median growth—median participant wrote\ndown 1.4 percent growth, but , you know, we ’ll have to see. It’s very hard to predict. We’ll also\nbe looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but , but\nideally , without see ing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: W hen you begin the cutting cycle, will it be\nessentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and\nerror, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven ’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really\nspecific target levels, which was if you —some of you will remember the thresholds that we used\nin, I guess, 2013. I don’t —the answer is, these are things that we haven ’t, you know, really\nworked out yet. We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence of Fox\nBusiness. So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is , is showing, about 75 basis points, does that\nsignal that there ’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. It wouldn’ t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn ’t a\nplan. That ’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down. So that ’s not something —you\nknow this, but allow me to say it again: We don’ t debate or discuss what the right, you know,\nwhose SEP is right. We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them. So and\nit’s, you know, it ’s important for people to know that. But it wouldn’ t need to be a sign of —it\ncould just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn ’t need the tight policy. It\ndepends on —the economy can evolve in many different ways, right ? So b ut, but it could be\nmore of what I just described.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And you focused on core inflation, we ’ve heard from— in\nother meetings. How sticky is core inflation right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that ’s what we ’re finding out, and we ’ve, you know, we ’ve\nseen real progress in , in core inflation. It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is\nthought to be stickier, but we ’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which\nwas the area where, where you would expect to see less progress. We are seeing some progress\nthere , though. And, i n fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing :\ngoods, housing services, nonhousing services. They ’re all contributing in different—at different\nlevels, you know, meeting by meeting—or , rather, report by report. So, yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let ’s go to Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this ,\nyou know, this morning and yesterday. I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the\nforecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking,\nyou know, on the inflation outlook.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we got —we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we\ngot PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation]. So it ’s\nvery late in the game, you know, to —but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to\nupdate their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today. After that, so staff has to —has to\ncumulate all of that and create the documents that you see. So until about midmorning, a little,\nmaybe late morning, it ’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast\nbased on what we saw today.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Okay. And do you see —I mean , how are you, when you think\nabout, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do\nyou, you know, how do you think about the economy we ’re in now kind of post -pandemic ? Do\nyou think that there ’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look\nat a rate cut path?\nCHAIR POWELL. The question of whether there have been fundamental structural\nshifts is , is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now. The one that\nwould affect —the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate\nof interest is. And so, for example, if it ’s risen, and I ’m not saying that it has, but if it were to\nhave risen, that would mean that , that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey\nthe same level of restriction. The t hing is, we ’re not really going to know that. You know,\npeople will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it. So it’s just\nthat it’s going to be uncertain.\nSo we ’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really\nunprecedented environment. Some —some one once said that you know the —you know the\nnatural rate of interest by its works , and that ’s really right, but that’ s very difficult because policy\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\noperates with a lag. So that ’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year. We started\nslowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.\nAnd, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.\nIn terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods? There’s—\nyou can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it doesn’ t look like it’ s ongoing, but I don’ t know if that ’s right. Maybe people just bought so\nmuch stuff that they temporarily don ’t want any more stuff. They haven’ t got anyplace to put it.\n[Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3 ½ on core. On a six -\nmonth annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent , though when you look at supercore and\nshelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data,\nhow much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’ t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates\nis that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean , you’ d want to be reducing restriction on the\neconomy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’ t overshoot,\nif we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes —it\ntakes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation. So I can ’t give you a precise answer . But if you look at what ’s in the —in the SEP, and , you\nknow, I think you’ ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would\ntake.\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t want to —I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise\npoint , because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be\nright. But we ’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi , Chair Powell. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to go back to\nthe stickiness- of-inflation question. Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have\ntalked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it ’s also\nbeen surprising how fast inflation has come down this year. I’m curious, do you think something\nhas changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still ? Or is it\nsomething different about the U.S. economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think —I think this. You know, we felt since the beginning that it\nwould be a combination of two factors. The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what\nhappened in the pandemic : the distortions of supply and demand. A nd the second thing would\nbe our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the\nsupply side to recover because of lower demand. We thought those two things were going to be\nnecessary. Sorry, say your —say the last part of your ques tion again.\nJEAN YUNG. If there was something different about the U.S. economy. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So it ’s not th at—it may or may not be about “different, ” the\nU.S. economy being different. I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload, pot-boiling -over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about. It was a combination of very\nstrong demand, without question, and unusual supply- side restriction s, both on the goods side but\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nalso on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock. So this is just very\nunusual .\nAnd, you know, we had the view —my colleagues and I broadly had the view —that we\ncould get a lot of —you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve , because you ran into\nthe limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren ’t workers and because people\ncouldn’ t—the supply chains were all broken. So we , we had the view that you could come\nstraight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced. A nd, you\nknow, something like that has happened. It happened so f ar. The question is, you know, once ,\nonce that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort\nof supply chain and shortages side has some , some ways to run—does labor force participation\nhave much more to run? It might. Immigration could help, but it may be that , at some point —at\nsome point , you will run out of supply- side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets\nharder. That ’s, that’s very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be\ndifferent, I’ d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We\njust don’ t know. I mean , inflation keeps coming down. The labor market keeps getting back\ninto balance. And it ’s so far , so good —although we kind of assume that it will get harder from\nhere. But so far , it hasn ’t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. We’ ll go to Megan for the last question.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi , Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan\nCassella with Barron’ s. I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’ s focus now on\nproceeding carefully and considering rate cuts . And can you talk us through what the latest\nthinking is , and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening\nat all?\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,\njust to get that out of the way.\nSo the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. What we’ ve been\nseeing is, you know, that we ’re allowing runoff each month. That’s adding up. I think we ’re\ndown—we ’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars]. That ’s showing up. The reverse repo facility [take -\nup] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or —as a result —or\nholding steady. At a certain point, you know, there won’ t be any more to come out of, or there ’ll\nbe a level where [take -up at] the reverse repo facility levels out. And , at that point, reserves will\nstart to come down.\nYou know, we still have —you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until\nwe judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that\nconsistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the\nbalance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with\nample reserves. We’ re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion\n[dollars]. We’re not —we don’ t think we ’re at those [ levels judged consistent with ample]\nreserves. There isn ’t a lot of evidence of that. We’re watching it carefully . And, you know, so\nfar—so far , it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time\nyou’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts? Is that time to rethink, or are you\nstill going to follow that thinking?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think they’ re, they’re on independent tracks. You ’re asking,\nthough, the question, I guess you’ re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such\ntime—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight ? And the answer is ,\n\nDecember 13 , 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference \n\nit depends on the reason. You know, if you’ re—if you’re —if you’re cutting rates because you ’re\ngoing back to normal, that ’s one thing, [ and distinct from] if you’ re cutting them because the\neconomy is really weak. So you can imagine, you’ d have to know what the reason is to know\nwhether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."
