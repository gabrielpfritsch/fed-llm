  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome.\nIn my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, and I will place that decision in the context of our economic projections and\nour policy strategy. I will then be glad to take your questions.\nAs indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that\nwere initiated at previous meetings. In particul ar, the Committee is keeping the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and c ontinues to anticipate that economic conditions are\nlikely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.\nThe Committee will continue the program th at we announced in September to extend the\naverage maturity of the Federal Reserve’s ho ldings of securities by purchasing longer-term\nTreasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treas ury securities. Our\npurchases of longer-term securiti es exert downward pressures on longe r-term interest rates; at the\nsame time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of\nour sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest ra tes. Consequently, this maturity\nextension program should foster more accommod ative financial conditions, thereby helping\nsupport a stronger recovery withou t changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet. In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our\npreviously announced program in which the prin cipal payments from our holdings of agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities ar e being reinvested in agency MBS. The\nCommittee regularly reviews the size and com position of our securities holdings, and we are\nprepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.\n\nIn conjunction with today’s meeting, the FO MC participants submitted projections for\neconomic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and\nover the longer run. The central tendencies and ranges of those pr ojections are depicted in the\nfigures that have been distributed. The longer -run projections—shown at the right side of each\nfigure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over\ntime, assuming appropriate monetary policy a nd no further shocks to the economy.\nThe longer-run projections for growth of r eal GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to\n2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for th e unemployment rate have a central tendency of\n5.2 to 6.0 percent. These projections can be inte rpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates\nof the economy’s normal or tre nd rate of growth and its norm al unemployment rate over the\nlonger run. Because the economy's longer- r un normal rates of output growth and\nunemployment are determined largely by nonmoneta ry factors that may evolve over time and\nthat cannot often be directly measured, these es timates are inherently unc ertain and subject to\nrevision.\nThe central tendency of the longer-run projectio ns for inflation, as measured by the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent. The inflation outlook over\nthe longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections\nessentially reflect participants’ j udgments about the inflation rate th at is most consistent with the\nFederal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum em ployment and stable pr ices. In effect, the\n“mandate-consistent” inflation rate is j udged to be 2 percent or a bit less.\nI turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook. Participants’ projections for real GDP\nfor 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent. Output growth strengthened\nduring the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the tem porary factors that had weighed on\n\ngrowth earlier in the year. In particular, global supply chain di sruptions associated with the\nnatural disaster in Japan have diminished. Mo reover, the prices of oil and other commodities\nhave come down from their peaks, easing st rains on household budgets and contributing to a\nsomewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.\nThe Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters,\nreflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tig ht credit conditions for many\nhouseholds and smaller businesses, volatility in fi nancial markets, fiscal consolidation at all\nlevels of government, and other factors. Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to\npick up somewhat as a result of improving fina ncial conditions, streng thening consumer and\nbusiness confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.\nSpecifically, the central tendency of participants ’ growth projections picks up gradually from\n2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.\nIn light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects\nthat the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quart ers. Participants’\nprojections for the unemployment rate in the four th quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of\n8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ pe rcentage point lowe r than the latest monthly reading of\n9.1 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the\nfourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants ’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of\nunemployment.\nIn short, while we still expect that econo mic activity and labor market conditions will\nimprove gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow. Moreover,\nthere are significant downside risks to the ec onomic outlook. Most not ably, concerns about\nEuropean fiscal and banking issues have contribut ed to strains in global financial markets, which\n\nhave likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth. Eur opean leaders have recently\nannounced a number of steps to address those issues. We will continue to monitor European\ndevelopments closely.\nI’ll turn now to the ou tlook for inflation. The prices of oil and other commodities rose\nsharply earlier this year. Consumer inflation consequently picked up ove r the first half of 2011,\nreflecting higher prices of ga soline, food, and other goods and services for which producers\npassed higher input costs along to their customers. In addition, pr ices of motor vehicles surged\nin response to the global supply disruptions associ ated with the disaster in Japan. However,\ninflation appears to have moderate d as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels\nof resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages. Furthermore, survey measures and\nmarket indicators imply that longer-term infl ation expectations have remained stable.\nConsequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle\nat or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 pe rcent or a bit less. Specifically, the central\ntendency of participants’ inflati on projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to\n1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014. The Committee will continue to\npay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflati on expectations.\nThe current economic outlook provides impor tant context for understanding today’s\npolicy decision. The Committee’s mandate from th e Congress is to seek maximum employment\nand price stability. With unemployment well abov e normal levels and expected to decline only\nslowly, and with inflation exp ected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the\nCommittee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy\naccommodation. We will continue to assess th e economic outlook in light of incoming\n\ninformation, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger\neconomic recovery in a cont ext of price stability.\nFinally, I would like to note th at the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy\ndecisions as clearly as possible, and we continue to explore ways of enhancing the clarity of our\npublic communications. Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about\npotential approaches to providing the public ad ditional information about our monetary policy\ngoals and policy strategy, as we ll as about our outlook for the ec onomy and for the future stance\nof monetary policy. However, no decisions about su ch approaches were made at this meeting.\nThank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, over the pa st several months, it seems there’s been\nincreasing criticism of the Fed’s policy. You received a letter on the eve of the September\nmeeting urging you not to take action from th e GOP leadership. Se veral GOP presidential\ncandidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates. On the first issue, do you feel that crossed\nthe line? Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence? On the second\nquestion, what are the GOP presidential candi dates not hearing or understanding about Fed\npolicy, in your opinion?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to\nstay nonpartisan and out of those debates. I mea n, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S.\neconomy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longe r term, in the short\nterm, it’s very important that the Fed be free fr om political pressures. And therefore, we are\ngoing to make our decisions based on what’s go od for the economy, and we’re not going to take\nany politics into account.\n\nNow, the concerns that have been expressed re late to the possibility that the Fed’s highly\nexpansionary policies might be cont ributing to inflation risk. I woul d simply point to the record.\nIf you look back for the last five years, in flation—although it’s been volatile be cause of\ncommodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable\ndefinition of price stability, whereas the area wh ere we have fallen shor t, obviously, is on the\nunemployment side. So I think that criticisms ba sed on the concern about inflation have so far,\nat least, not proved to be very valid.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Was th e letter appropriate?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I’m not going to comment on that. I—we listen to\neverybody’s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on\nthe interest of the American peopl e, what’s in the interest of the economy, and that’s what we’re\ngoing to do.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Has the Fed discusse d the idea of nominal GDP targeting?\nAnd what are your views on the advantages a nd disadvantages of that approach?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So the Fed’s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate. We\nhave a mandate for both employment and for pric e stability, and we have a framework in place\nthat allows us to communicate and to think a bout the two sides of that mandate. We talked\ntoday—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable,\nas something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting\ndiscussion. However, we think th at within the existing framework that we have, which looks at\nboth sides of the mandate, not just some combin ation of the two, we can communicate whatever\nwe need to communicate about future monetary policy. So we are not contemplating at this\n\ndate—at this time—any radical change in fram ework. We are going to stay within the dual-\nmandate approach that we’ve b een using until this point.\nJENNIFER LIBERTO. Chairman, you’ve said in the past you understand some of the\nanger on display with the Occupy Wall Street proteste rs. And a lot of the anger is directed at the\nFed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the\nfinancial system and promotes income inequality. Can—are the protesters right? Is the Fed part\nof the problem? And, secondarily, can the Fe d do anything to promote a more equitable\neconomy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many\npeople are dissatisfied with the state of the econo my. I’m dissatisfied with the state of the\neconomy. Unemployment is far to o high. Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been\ngoing on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that\nhas continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past. So again, I fully\nsympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be,\nand in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectru m are understandable.\nI think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions. The Federal\nReserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the fina ncial system in 2008 and 2009. A\nvery simplistic interpreta tion of that was that we were doing th at because we wanted to preserve,\nyou know, bankers’ salaries. That is obviously not the case. What we were doing is trying to\nprotect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collap se of both the financial system\nand the American economy. We needed to take those steps. If we hadn’t taken them, the\nconsequences would have been dire. And not everybody understands that, and therefore they\nsometimes misunderstand our motives. Our motives ar e strictly to do what’s in the interest of\n\nthe broad public, and I believe that our efforts to stabilize the financial system, which ultimately\nproved successful, were very much in the interest of th e broad public.\nWith respect to the current economy, as I de scribed earlier, we are currently continuing\nwith our accommodative monetary policy. We are trying to do our be st to support economic\ngrowth and job creation. I think it would be help ful if we could get assistance from some other\nparts of the government to work with us, to he lp create more jobs. But certainly, we are doing\nour part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.\nWith respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs. It\ngives people opportunities. It gives people a chance to earn in come, gain experience, and to\nultimately earn more. But that’s an indirect a pproach; that’s really the only way the Fed can\naddress inequality per se.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, the\nFed’s forecast for 2013 shows the unemploymen t rate finishing the year between 7.8 and\n8.2 percent. The statement says th at short-term rates will stay near their current levels at least\nthrough mid-2013. Does that suggest that the Fed c ould conceive of raising short-term interest\nrates before unemployment even ge ts to 8 percent or much lower? And if not, could you explain\nhow people should interpret those two messages?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the statement says “at least” mid-2013. So, clearly, it\ncould well be some point beyond that, and market s are currently anticipa ting a somewhat later\nliftoff. One of the things we discussed yesterday in our comm unications discussion was how we\nmight further clarify that part of the statement and try to provide more information about what\nconditions would prevail at the tim e that we would be considering raising rates. But we haven’t\ncome to that point yet, but we certainly would li ke to provide more clarity about that. But again,\n\nlet me emphasize that what we are saying now is “at least”; ther e’s no implication that we would\nnecessarily move in mid-2013 with those conditions prevai ling that you described.\nPEDRO DACOSTA. Pedro DaCost a from Reuters. Mr. Chairm an, what is your appetite\nfor a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-bac ked securities purchases? The Fed had stated\nthe intention to move the struct ure of its balance sheet more to its original, you know, Treasuries-\nonly composition. But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and\nfolks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale asset purchases on the MBS side. Could you comment on your views on that particular\nproposal?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, I’ll be glad to. You were absolutely correct—first,\nthat ultimately we would like to return our portfol io to Treasuries only. That may be some time\ndown the road at this point. Y ou’re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last\nmeeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed securities and agency debt back into\nmortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some additional support for the mortgage market.\nThe housing sector is a very importa nt sector. It’s—the problems in that sector are clearly a big\nreason why our economy is not recovering more quickly. So I do thi nk that purchases of\nmortgage-backed securities is a viable option. It ’s certainly something we would consider if\nconditions were appropriate. So the answer is yes, we w ould certainly look at that.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com. At the\nmoment now, banks are holding hundr eds of billions of dollars in excess reserves, and at the\nsame time, corporations seem to be holding lo ts of cash on the—and foreigners—at the same\ntime, foreigners keep investing a lot of money in the United Stat es. The current account deficit\n\nis very large. Could you shed some light on that situation? Is there something that foreigners\nknow that U.S. companies don’t abou t investing in the U.S.?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, most of the— a great deal of the investment in the\nU.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. governme nt debt in Treasury secu rities. And that, in\nturn, reflects the desire for the liquidity and safe ty provided by the U.S. Treasury market. For\nexample, as you know, two of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities are China and\nJapan, who hold those securities primarily as fore ign exchange reserves and, in the case of\nChina, in an effort to keep their exchange ra te from appreciating too quickly. So, I was—while\nit’s good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it’s not\nquite the same as investing in pl ant and equipment. We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there,\nbut it’s still obviously too low to be consistent w ith a full employment economy.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business. Sir, could you comment on the failure of\nMF Global, which is a primary dealer? And specifically, the Financial Times is reporting that\nthe leverage ratio at MF Global was 40 to 1. Were you aware of that? Did the Fed approve of\nthat? Is that an acceptable leverage ratio, pa rticularly since the fi nancial crisis?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved\nMF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year. At that time, the\ncompany met the criteria that had been set fo rth in terms of management, financial condition,\ncapacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary deal er. We have set those standards in a way that\nwould allow smaller firms like MF Global to part icipate in the primary dealer market. But I\nwould like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of point s. First, we are not the regulators of MF\nGlobal. That’s done by the SEC and the CFTC , so we do not have ongoing insight into\ndevelopments within the company. And secondl y, again, making them a primary dealer did not\n\nin any way constitute a seal of approval. In fact, the New York Fed’s website contains a\nstatement pretty much to that effect. So, they were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with\nthem before they failed, and we’ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our\ntransactions with the company. Again, in terms of your questi on about leverage and financial\ncondition, the company declined very, very quick ly based on, apparently, a small number of\nlarge bets. As far as I know we were not awar e of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not—\nwe are not the overseers, the re gulators of that company.\nPEDRO DACOSTA. Can I just as k whether you see it as an is olated case or whether this\nis the start of some thing broader?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The question is, Was that an isolated case? It appears to be\nan idiosyncratic case, and we’re monitori ng the possible impacts on funding markets and\nelsewhere. And, so far, we’ve not seen any significant impact on fi nancial stability.\nJON HILSENRATH. To follow up on that question, should the Fed be, on an ongoing\nbasis, monitoring its primary dealers?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The question is, Sh ould the Fed be monitoring its primary\ndealers? Only if the Fed is the supervis or. In this case, the combination of a\nbroker–dealer and a futures commission merchant imply that the SEC and the CFTC are the\nappropriate supervisors. They would not have qualified—this company would not have qualified\nas a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so there’s no basis at this point for\nthe Fed to be the overseer of that, of those companies.\nNEIL IRWIN. Neil Irwin with the Washington Post . Mr. Chairman, this is the third\nstraight set of economic projecti ons you’ve released that have downgraded forecasts for growth\nand for employment. I wonder, is there some sy stematic error, some blind spot that’s behind\n\nthese, kind of, overly optimistic forecasts? Wh at are you doing internally to understand what\nyou got wrong the last few projections?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’s a pe rfectly fair question. And, you know, we\nspend a lot of time reviewing those errors. The staff, in particular , presents us with information\non forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at th at very carefully. I think it’s\nclear that—in retrospect, that the severity of th e financial crisis and a number of other problems,\nincluding the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than\nwe initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by\nthe household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery. So, yes, we have again\ndowngraded the medium-term forecast. Evid ently, the forces—you know, the drags on the\nrecovery were stronger than we thought.\nI would add, however, though, that although I th ink it’s very importa nt to look at the\nfundamental factors affecting th e recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck. For\nexample, this year, the combination of the natu ral disaster in Japan wh ich had global impacts in\nterms of growth, oil price increases , the European debt crisis, whic h was not anticipated to be as\nsevere and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been\nnegatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Television. Many Americans\nwonder what the Fed has actually accomplished w ith its monetary policy actions since about\nQE2. Fed officials like to talk about the effect they’ve had on interest rates, but the economy\nseems insensitive to interest rates these days . Can you explain what you have managed to\naccomplish? Can you tell us whether you feel your mandate requires you to do anything you can\nthink of on an ongoing basis until some targets ar e met? And can you ex plain to the average\n\nAmerican why you’re doing what yo u’re doing? And do you think that you risk credibility if the\naverage American doesn’t s ee some sort of improvement in the economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, it’s a fair quest ion. I would first say that monetary\npolicy is having effects on the economy. And we’v e talked about the effects on asset prices, but\nwe have continued to analyze the effects of chan ges in interest rates, for example, on decisions\nlike investment or car purchases. One area wher e monetary policy has been blunted—the effects\nhave been blunted—has been the mortgage mark et, where very tight credit standards have\nprevented many people from purchasing or refi nancing their homes, and therefore the low\nmortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped. So, monetary\npolicy may be somewhat less powerful in the curren t context than it has been in the past, but\nnevertheless, it is affecting econom ic growth and job creation.\nIf you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one,\nwhich is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the\nproblems of high inflation but al so very importantly has avoide d the risk of deflation. And\nwe’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem\nand very difficult to get out of once you are there. So we have been able to achieve, on average,\nstable prices.\nWith respect to growth, I think that our polic ies, including the cutti ng of rates to zero in\nDecember 2008 and the first round of asset purchases in the fall of ’08 and in the spring of ’09,\nwere very important for helpi ng to explain why the economy st opped contracting and began to\ngrow again in the middle of 2009. I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth\nand job creation. I would argue th at we’ve also been successful w ith some of the later actions\nthat we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we\n\nalways face the problem of asking the question, Well, where would we be without these policies?\nAnd our best estimates are that—absent the supp ort of monetary policy, that the economy would\nbe in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher th an it is. That being\nsaid, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to\nwhere we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable . Yes, I do think that\nwith—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price\nstability and maximum empl oyment. We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have\nare efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risk s or negative side effects that are worse than\nthe benefits. We’ll always be making that evaluation.\nGREG IP. Greg Ip with the Economist . In response to Pedro’s question, you said you\nwould consider more MBS purchases when th e conditions were appropriate. Could you\nelaborate on what conditions woul d be appropriate to do additiona l large-scale asset purchases,\nwhat your reaction function is right now?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I don’t think I can be as precise as you would like.\nI—the MBS purchases and Treasury s ecurities purchases are one set of tools that we have. The\nother set of tools that we have are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate\ndecisions to economic conditions or to time. Thos e are—with interest rate s close to zero, those\nare basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use\nthem and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives.\nIn terms of when we would use these, I thi nk all I can say is that the Committee will have\nto look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in\nterms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe\nthat monetary stimulus would be beneficial , you know, then the Committee obviously would try\n\nto take corrective action. But I can’t—you know , it’s a Committee decision, we’ll have to look\nat the outlook. But we remain prepared to take action as appropriate to make sure the recovery\ncontinues, to make sure that we ha ve stable prices in the U.S.\nJOSHUA ZUMBRUN. Josh Zumbrun from Bl oomberg. Your colleague Daniel Tarullo\nphrased this as, “Further action would be required in the absence of favorable developments.”\nDoes that mean that, looking at the forecast ta bles we have here today, that if we don’t see\nimprovement from what’s in those tables , that further action would be required?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Again, I can’t speak for my colleagues on the Committee. I\nwill say that that forecast we have is satisfact ory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation\nremains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of the rate of growth of the\neconomy, the rate at which unemployment comes dow n. So I think the judgment we’re going to\nhave to make is, do the tools we have—are those t ools likely to be sufficiently effective? Or do\nthey bear costs and risks that would make them less effective or not worth using? So it’s a\njudgment we’re going to have to co ntinue to make. We’re going to have to continue to evaluate\nthe outlook. But again, I really can’t speak for my colleagues until we have looked at the entire\narray of data and made a decision about that.\nJOHN BERRY. John Berry, Fiscal Times . In the European debt deal that may or may\nnot come to pass, it’s been said that the ba nks operating there—the bi g banks—have all agreed\nthat a 9 percent Tier 1 capital ra tio is appropriate. A lot of U.S. banks have been arguing that\nthey can’t afford to do that. It will reduce lending, but it would also put them at a competitive disadvantage internationally. With that happeni ng in Europe, do you think it’s appropriate that\nthe big banks in the U.S. should accept such a Tier 1 capital requirement, and how does that\ndevelopment stand at this point?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we are co mmitted to, and are in the process of,\nimplementing Basel III, which has a basic require ment including a buffer of 7 percent, and then\nadditional surcharges for the largest institutions. We think that’s an a ppropriate framework. I’m\nnot sure that the 9 percent that Europeans are talk ing about is really comparable to this, to the\ncapital requirements that we are imposing, or will be imposing, on U.S. banks. For example, the composition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity. I do not know\nwhat risk weights are being applied to the a ssets. So there are a number of questions of\ncomparability. My expectation and hope is that —over the medium term, that the Europeans who\nagreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over time. Of course, that’s being pha sed in over a number of years so as not to jeopardize in any way\nthe recovery. But, over the remainder of this de cade, we anticipate implementing all of the key\nelements of Basel III in the United States.\nLUCA DILEO. Luca DiLeo with Dow Jones. Mr. Chairman, you’ve partly addressed\nthis, but there’s something I still fail to understa nd. Given that your fore cast is still so gloomy\nfor employment through 2014, given that you’re not worried about inflation, and given that you\nsaid that MBS is a viable op tion, why not act today?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory\none in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow. We have taken a lot of\nactions. Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly\naccommodative now—we brought rates close to zer o, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset\npurchases, we have made commitments about rates, we’ve extended the maturity of our\nportfolio—so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at th e last two meetings, so we are\nbeing very aggressive in providing moneta ry accommodation. I was asked before about\n\nconditions for further accommodation. Well, we are prepared to do that, and we will continue to\nobserve, you know, how the economy evolves. You know, what we have is a projection; there’s\na lot of uncertainty there. A nd so it will be very important to see, you know, what actually\nhappens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth. So, but we are prepared\nto take further action. We’ve already taken quite a bit of action, but we’r e prepared to do more,\nand we have the tools to do more if that’s appropriate. Again, while I do not shirk the\nresponsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously, a broad range\nof policies can affect growth and employment, a nd I hope that there will be a range of actions\nthat will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve’s efforts.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the LA Times . You mentioned before\nthe streak of bad luck that struck the economy earl ier this year. With the latest developments in\nEurope this week, where the debt deal seemi ngly was done and now the rug was pulled out, are\nyou getting the sense that this economy just ca n’t catch a break? And how would you advise\naverage Americans to deal with these continue d shocks to the economy and to the financial\nmarkets?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I don’t want to make excuses. Again, we did\noverestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I\nmentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repa ir, the state of the hous ing market, and so on.\nBut that being said, as I indicate d earlier, there has been a certain amount of bad luck, and I think\nthe volatility in financial market s associated with the European situation has been—along with\nvolatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions , has been a drag on recovery. I think it’s part\nof the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at\nthe last press conference in June . So there has been that concer n. It’s showing up in Americans’\n\nconfidence and sentiment. You can see that righ t now consumer confidence is about where it\nwas in the depths of recession; th at’s very discouraging. To some extent, at least, it will be a\ndrag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.\nMy best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to\nthink about your personal situat ion and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial\nposition. Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay\ndown debt. That’s, of course, important. At th e same time, you want to make smart decisions,\nyou want to make good investments, you want to budget properly. So financial literacy is a big\npart of this, and lack of financia l literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the\nfirst place. So I would advise pe ople to try to be smart about th eir finances. Unfortunately, we\ncan’t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the th ings that are happening there do affect us, and\nthat’s an unfortunate fact. I hope very much that the Europeans will find a set of solutions that\nwill allow markets to calm down and take off some of the headwinds from the U.S. economy.\nROBIN HARDING. Robi n Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, could\nyou explain the menu of options that the Comm ittee has for improving its communication about\nwhen it might raise interest rates and what the conditions are in which it might do that? For\nexample, might it makes sense for the Fed to publish a forecast of its own future interest rates,\nand what’s the advantages and disa dvantages of that? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, again, as I no ted in my opening remarks, no decisions\nhave been made, so I want to be very clear that no —you know, there is no outcome\nhere in this discussion. But cl early, there’s a range of things that we can do. We can provide\nmore information about our objec tives, for example. We could provide information about where\nwe want inflation to be in the long term, for exam ple. We can also provide information about the\n\nfuture path of interest rates, which we’ve done to some extent via our “mid-2013” language in\nthe statement. An alte rnative approach, which Charlie Evans a nd others have suggested, is to tie\nthat to economic conditions and to provide more information about under what circumstances we\nwould raise rates. That is certain ly something that we have discu ssed and I think is an interesting\nalternative. There’s a lot of interest in using the survey of economic projections in constructive\nways as we have up until now to provide inform ation to the public about our plans. And in\nparticular, using the SEP as a way of giving in formation about our future policy decisions is\nsomething that’s on the table. There’s no decision made about that, but th at’s one direction that\nwe might find productive.\nMICHELLE FLEURY. Michelle Fleury, BBC News. You mentioned, obviously, that\nEurope and what’s happening there has an imp act here on the U.S. economy. To what degree\ncan the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it is a bit frustrating. Obviously, the key\ndecisionmakers in Europe are the European leaders and economic policymakers there, and\nultimately it’s their responsibility to find solutions to this very difficult problem. Of course, I\nand the Treasury Secretary and other economic policymakers in United States do confer and\nmeet with European policymakers on a regular ba sis, and we give our advice, for what it’s\nworth—sometimes they take it, sometimes they don’t. But, obviously, they’re the ones who\nhave to make those decisions. So what we can do, really, is only a couple of things. One is that\nwe can look at our own financial institutions a nd try to assess the exposures and the linkages\nbetween our institutions and thos e in Europe and the sovereign de bt in Europe, and we’ve been\ndoing that on a consistent basis. We’ve looked also, of course, with ot her regulators at money\nmarket mutual funds and other types of financial institutions that have connections to Europe.\n\nSo that’s one thing that we can do. And the ot her thing that we can do is stand ready, if\nnecessary, to provide whatever support the br oader economy needs and the financial system\nneeds, should things worsen. I mean, we ar e hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously\nimplemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these st resses, but in the case that things do get\nworse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the\nU.S. economy from the effects.\nKATHERINE LEWIS. Hi, Katherine Lewis for Bankrate.com. Can you talk about what\nimpact you’ve seen from Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond\nyields? And do you have any message for people who are relying on those kinds of instruments\nfor income?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure. It ’s a little bit early to full y assess the effects of what\nwe call the maturity extension program. But it do es seem to be having, at least in a preliminary\nsense—it does seem to be having the intended ef fect of lowering longer-term interest rates and\ntwisting the yield curve, as was an ticipated. That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage\nrates and other interest rates wh ich are relevant to the economy. We are quite aware that very\nlow interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have co sts for a lot of people. They\nhave costs for savers. We have complaints from banks that complain that their net interest\nmargins are affected by low interest rates. Pensio n funds will be affected if low interest rates for\na protracted period require them to make larg er contributions. So we are aware of those\nconcerns, and we take th em very seriously.\nI think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and\nrecovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy\nconditions accommodative, trying to support the r ecovery, trying to suppor t job creation. After\n\nall, savers are not going to get very good return s in an economy which is in a deep recession. I\nmean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an\neconomy which is growing. And so, we believe th at our policy will ultimately benefit not just\nworkers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that\nthey can earn on their investments will impr ove with the improvement in the economy.\nDARREN GERSH. Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report . Given how hard it has been\nto bring down unemployment in the past, why ar e you confident you have the tools to bring it\ndown in the future?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and\naccommodation. We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—th at is, unemployment arising because of\ninadequate demand in the economy. If that’s the case, then a m onetary policy—by lowering\ninterest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand,\nshould stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical\nunemployment. That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s\nbeen a very slow process here, th ere’s no reason to think that the sa me basic effect will not work\nin this case as well.\nNow, it’s also possible that part of the in crease in unemployment reflects so-called\nstructural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportun ities, loss of skills,\ngeographical mismatch, et cetera. And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is\nmuch less effective because in that case, only ot her kinds of labor market policies really can\nmake progress against that type of unemployment. But again, I do think that a considerable part\nof the unemployment that we are seeing is cycli cal and is thus amenable to monetary policy.\n\n comment: Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can\nbecome structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force,\nas their work networks dry up and so on. So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address\nthe unemployment problem in a sense while it ’s still amenable to monetary policy.\nBRAIMOH ODION-ESENE. Braim oh Odion-Esene, Market News International. You\nmentioned that the Fed has the tool s and stands ready to use it. Bu t given that in the statement it\nsays that the Committee saw growth strengthened so mewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say\nthat the FOMC is less aggressively cons idering more policy accommodation, given the\nimprovement they saw in the third quarter?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a\nmodest improvement. We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable\namount of capital investment, lower inventorie s, therefore suggesting more production in the\nfourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter. So\nthere was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in th e period, in financial\nmarkets, although some of that has been reversed. So that was part of the situation that we were\nacknowledging in our statement, that’s true. But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook\nrelative to our June projections has been dow ngraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory\nover the next few years. And we ’ll continue to ask ourselves wh ether or not additional stimulus\nor additional actions can provide a better outcome , and that’s certainly something that remains\non the table and we’ll continue to evaluate as we go forward.\nThank you."
