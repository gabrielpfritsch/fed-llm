  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon.\nIt’s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began. The economy\ncontinues to expand at a moderate pace. Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high.\nAbout 5 million people —more than 40 percent of the unemployed—have been with out a job for\nsix months or more, and millions more who say they would like full -time work have been able to\nfind only part -time employment or have stopped looking entirely. The conditions now prevailing\nin the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential. A return to broad- based prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn\nrequires stronger economic growth. Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that\nlargely reflected swings in energ y prices, inflation has remained tame and appears likely to run at\nor below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC ’s) 2 percent objective in coming\nquarters and over the longer term.\nAgainst a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued\ninflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy. Today the Committee took several steps. First, it decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage -backed securities\n(MBS), initiated at the September meeting, at a pace o f $40 billion per month. Second, the\nCommittee decided to purchase longer -term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion\nper month, after its current program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the year. In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain\ndownward pressure on longer -term interest rates and to keep financial conditions\naccommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation\n\nover time is clo se to our 2 percent objective. Finally, the Committee today also modified its\nguidance about future rate policy to provide more information to the public about how it\nanticipates it will react to evolving economic conditions. I will return to this change in our\ncommunication after discussing our decision to continue asset purchases.\nAlthough the Committee’s announcement today specified the initial monthly pace and\ncomposition of asset purchases, it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended. Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend on the Committee’s\nevaluation of incoming information, in two respects.\nFirst, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability. In assessing the extent of progress,\nthe Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the\nunemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others. Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly.\nSecond, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to\nassess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks of its asset purchase program. The Federal Reserve’s asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the economy, for example, by helping to keep mort gage rates historically low. The Committee\nexpects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly updating those assessments. If future evidence suggests that the program’s effectiveness has declined, or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as\n\nappropriate. More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of\nsecurities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived\nbenefits and costs of the program.\nUnlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated with the Committee’s forward\nguidance about the federal funds rate, which I will discuss in a moment, the criteria the\nCommittee will use to make decisions about the pace and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular, continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. Because we expect to learn more over time\nabout the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases in the current economic context , we\nbelieve that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time.\nIn today’s statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance to clarify how it\nexpects its target for the federal funds rate to depend on future economic developments. Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, a nd longer -term inflation\nexpectations continue to be well anchored.” This formulation is a change from earlier statements\nin which forward guidance about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example, in the statements following its September and October meetings, the Committee\nindicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “ at least through mid -2015.” The modified formulation makes more explicit the\nFOMC’s intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger\neconomic recovery in the context of price stability, a strategy that we believe will help support\n\nhousehold and business confidence and spending. By tying future monetary policy more\nexpli citly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make\nmonetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public.\nThe change in the form of the Committee’s forward guidance does not in itself imply any\nchange in the Com mittee’s expectations about the likely future path of the federal funds rate\nsince the October meeting. In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid- 2015 and projects that inflation will re main close\nto 2 percent over that period. Thus, given the Committee’s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee’s earlier statements that “exceptionally low\nlevels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid -2015.”\nLet me emphasize that the 6 ½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be\ninterpreted as the Committee’s longer -term objective for unemployment. Indeed, in the\neconomic projections submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting, the central tendency of participants’ est imates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.\nHowever, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment. Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC’s longer -term\ninflation objective of 2 percent. As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the longer term.\n\nAlthough the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee\nexpects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot. In this\nregard, let me make several points.\nFirst, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low -rate policy as likely to\nbe appropriate at least until the specified thresholds are met. Reaching one of those thresholds,\nhowever, will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation. For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6½ percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate.\nUltimately , in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee\nwill follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run\n2 percent goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level.\nSecond, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete\nassessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions. For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation. The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable.\nThird, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected\ninflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation. The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory\n\nfluctuations in inflation, suc h as those induced by short -term variations in the prices of\ninternationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend. In\nmaking its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation. Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.\nFinally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information on economic\nand financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted in a manner consistent w ith our\ndual mandate.\nIt’s worth noting that the goals of the FOMC’s asset purchases and of its federal funds\nrate guidance are somewhat different. The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum of the economy by fostering more -accommodative financial conditions,\nwhile the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information about the future circumstances under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation. I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee to end asset purchases, whenever that point is reached, would\nnot be a turn to tighter policy. While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth. Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing accommodation through rate increases. Moreover, as I have discussed today, the decisions to modify the asset purchase program and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria.\nIn conclusion, the FOMC’s actions today are part of our ongoing efforts to support\neconomic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability. As I have often stressed,\n\nhowever, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can\nget the U.S. economy fully back on track. In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers come together soon to achieve longer -term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies that\ncould derail the ongoing recovery.\nThank you. I would be happy to answer your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC. I guess I have a lot of\nquestions but I’ll just offer up two here. Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate? What does that achieve? Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from. You had to point out in the statement that it’s not substantially different from the calendar dates we set back in\nOctober. Do you have to keep doing that from now on to make it clear that —and then just\nthirdly, I guess I know I said two—\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m going to forget.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But then you have another paragraph after that that says it ’s not just\ntarget it’s something else. So, it’s unclear to me what good these targets are if you have to reference a calendar date, and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it’s not really targets.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, so first, the —as I said —the asset purchases and the\nrate increases have different objectives. The asset purchases are about creating some near -term\nmomentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate t arget, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing\naccommodation. Two very different objectives. Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool. We have —we’ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are,\nabout what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might\n\ncreate, and we’ll be seeing how —what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know,\nthe level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve. And so, for that reason, a s I\ndiscussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative\nat this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward. Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy. And so we’ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect. With respect to the date, in the transition today, we wanted to m ake clear that the change in guidance did not —it happens to\nbe the case that it doesn’t change our mid -2015 expectation. Going forward, we’ll drop the date\nand rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will\nbe able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontr ansparent way, so I think that’s\nbeneficial. Does that cover your —okay.\nMARCY GORDON. Mr. Chairman, what prompted the Committee to make the decision\nat this particular time to specify targets? And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compar ed to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate,\ncloser more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That’s a very good question. We took the change today\nafter a good bit of discussion. We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at\nour last meeting. And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out. We —while there are different\nviews on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot of agreement that having a more\nexplicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and\n\nmore helpful to the markets and to the public than our date -based guidance, and therefore, there\nwas a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance.\nSo we do hope that it’ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we’re going to respond going forward. It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment —by no means. First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain\ncompletely committed to our 2 percent longer -run objective. Moreover, we expect our forecast,\nas you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are that inflation will\nactually remain, despite this threshold of 2½, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward. And so—and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely\nconsistent with our long -standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest\nrates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close\nto target. So we —I think both sides of the mandate are well -served here. There is no real\nchange in policy. What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and\neconomic conditions.\nMARCY GORDON. Could I ask, also, given that the —your economic projections are all\nthe more important now that you’ve specified these targets , is it difficult to put forward these\nprojections now given the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff? How sort of plastic are these?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are you talking about the SEP projections?\nMARCY GORDON. Yes.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the\neconomy. Even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it’s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism. We saw wha t happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell,\n\npresumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff. So, clearly, this is a major risk\nfactor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward. I would suspect and, althoug h the participants don’t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are\nassuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the entire fiscal cliff. So I\nthink that’s probably the underlying assumption that most people took when they made their projections. But as you —you’re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if\nthe fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I’m sure you would see changes in the forecast.\nALISTER BULL. Alister Bull from Reuters. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Could\nyou talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a\nmonth represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy, because you’re now going to be adding a little bit more to the size of balance sheet? And also, you know, you’ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases unt il you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the\nlabor market , and you’ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you’ve also got\nthis 6½ percent inflation threshold out there as well. So, could you talk about what sort of eviden ce you’d see to sort of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The first part of your question was?\nALISTER BULL. Is this an additional stimulus or are you—\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in\nSeptember. You recall in September we expressed dis satisfaction with progress in the labor\nmarket. We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would\n\nundertake additional asset purchases or other actions. And that ’s what we ’ve done today is\nsimply follow through on what we said we would do in September. I don’t think that we have,\nrelative to last month, I don’ t think we have significantly added to accommodation. The reason\nis that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues’, that what matters primarily is the\nmix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet. So what’s imp ortant is\nthe fact that we’re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that’s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se . So, in my judgment, the amount of\nstimulus is more or less the same, it’s just being continued. It’s a follow -through from what we\nsaw in September. In terms of criteria, again, what we’ve done is we’ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a mont h of purchases. We are prepared to vary that as new information\ncomes in. For example, if the economy’s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases. But again, the problem with giving a specific number is that there are multiple criteria o n which we make this decision. We’ll be\nlooking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we’ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy. For example, I hope it won’t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I’ve said many times, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish. Likewise, as I said, we’ll also be looking at the efficacy and costs of our program and if, you know, we find, we expect it to be efficacious but if we find that it’s not working as well as we hoped or if the various costs are emerging that we ha d not\nanticipated then th at would also have to be taken into account as we think about it. So, we\nthought it was not constructive because we ourselves don’t know precisely what would define\n\nsubstantial improvement . But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not em erge,\nwe’ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market.\nPETER COOK. Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television. Mr. Chairman, if I could\nfollow up just on your last response there. Given the fiscal cliff, is it pos sible that if the country,\nif the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we\nwere to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that? And more specific ally, you coined the phrase “fiscal cliff ,” and I wanted to get\nyour take on whether you still feel it’s the most appropriate language to describe what would happen at the beginning of the year. There are some Americans who may be alarmed by the\nlanguage, some economists say it’s more of a slope. Do you still feel it’s appropriate given the\ncircumstances — th e contraction, the fiscal contraction, that would come if there is no deal?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, for the first part of your question if the economy\nactually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO’s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate. And so, on the margin, we would try to do what w e could. We would\nperhaps increase a bit. But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff. It’s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point. O n terms of the terminology, well, and people have different\npreferences about what they want to call things, I think it’s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy. If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary ,\nthe economy will, I think, go off a cliff. I think that it’s reasonable to be concerned about this. I don’t buy the idea that a short -term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly. I think it\nwould be costly and, in fact, we’re already seeing costs. Why is it that consumer confidence\n\ndropped so sharply this week? Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?\nWhy is —why are the markets volatile? Why is business investment at among its weakest levels\nduring the recovery? I thi nk all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the\nanticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don’t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important. The most helpful thing that could—that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability , which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also\navoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, I\njust—I want to try to square up some numbers . The threshold that you announced today for\nwhen rate hikes might start is 6½ percent. The Committee’s assessment of the longer -run\nunemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer -run equilibrium fed funds\nrate is around 4 percent according to these projections . It suggests that when the Fed does start\nraising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate. Is that, specifically, is that the case and, more generally, can you talk about what this fra mework that you set up today says about the exit strategy that you had laid out\nsome time ago and whether that’s evolving or changing?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’s a good question. So first of all, we don’t have a\nprecise estimate of the long -run sustai nable unemployment rate. The estimates that were\nprovided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent. So, it could be well less than 6 ½ percent, so that gives us some time.\n\nMy anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whe never\nthat occurs, would be relatively gradual. I don’t think we’re looking at a rapid increase. Of\ncourse, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions. But it’s —the path that we’r e\nbasing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes a n increase\nin the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6½ percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that. And I —what we said in our statement is that\nwe would take a balanced approach. In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we may or may not raise rates at that point. We’ll look at the situation. But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, w hich I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would\nbe moderate.\nThis is consistent —the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today\nbecause the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time. And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago. That be ing said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we\nmay have to reconsider the pace or timing of that, but I don’t see any changes that would, you know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit.\nZACHARY GOLDFARB. Thank you. Zach Goldfarb. I’m going to continue the two\nquestion trend and ask— first on the fiscal cliff, it sounds like you would prefer a sensible\nbalance of fiscal consolidation and support for the recovery, but if people in Congres s can’t do\nthat in the next two weeks, do you think postponing off this whole consolidation is preferable to going over the cliff? And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit\n\nmore color on how you set the thresholds at wha t they were? And what the alternatives were,\nand how you weighed various alternative but similar policies?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure. I’m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing\non the fiscal cliff. I —you know, there’s a problem with kicking the can down the road. It might\navoid some of the short -term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our\nlonger -term fiscal situation and I don’t want to see that. So I think for the best —it’s in the best\ninterest of the economy to come t o a two -part solution, if you will. Part one is to modify fiscal\npolicy in a way that doesn’t create enormous headwinds for the recovery in the near term. And\npart two is to at least take important steps towards achieving a framework, at least, by which,\nperhaps through further negotiation, the Congress and the Administration can achieve a\nsustainable path for fiscal policy. That —both of these parts are very important. I don’t think\nthat we can consider these negotiations a success unless both of them happen.\n[Speaker unknown; i naudible r emark]\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No. I think they ’re equally important. On the threshold\nnumbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff , both here\nand at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so -called optimal policy , or in the best policy\nthat we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation. And when we do that analy sis, what we find is that the best interest rate path —as best as we can determine it based on\nour models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect —has rates remaining low until\nunemployment drops below 6½ percent. And it projects if we put in the two—the half of a\npercentage point above the 2 percent goal as a kind of protection against any problem with price\n\nstability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there.\nInflation will stay around 2 percent, which will be consistent with our longer -term objective.\nZACH GOLDFARB. [Inaudible Remark] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If we got important new information about the structure of\nthe economy, it’s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best —this is\none of the advantages of this approach over the date -based approach. If information comes in\nwhich says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date. But it doesn’t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation.\nSCOTT SPOERRY. Scott Spoerry from CNN, sir. When you were appearing on\n60 Minutes , one of the things that happened was that you visited your old hometown, and you\ntalked a little bit about how the economy had affected people that you grew up with and affected the people down there. There are a lot of just regul ar people like that who are out on the\ncountryside wondering what really happens to them if we do go over the federal cliff. Taxes go\nup, spending goes down. Do they need to look for a recession? Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think? What do people out there really need to worry about and prepare for when it comes to actually going over that fiscal cliff, if the folks in Washington can’t get their act together?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I come from a part of South Carol ina which has been\neconomically challenged for quite a long time and remains so. I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from —mostly agricultural, it\nhas a little bit of manufacturing —has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate,\n\nand people are having a hard time there. And I’ve visited there a few times since I became\nChairman.\nSo, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a\nstronger economy —more jobs —so that folks across the country, including places like the one\nwhere I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves. So that’s extremely important and I think it’s very important that we not just loo k at the numbers.\nIt’s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it’s one -tenth or two -tenths. Every tenth\nmeans, you know, many, many people are represented there. So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we\nalways try to do that. And I want to—it’s always a delicate balance— you don’t want to scare\npeople. And I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution, and I certainly hope\nthey will.\nBut as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to\noccur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment . And of course, the consequences of that will\nbe felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt. So, it’s exceptionally urgent and important that the Congress and the Administration come to a sensible agreement on this issue.\nSCOTT SPOERRY. Okay, sir, I had a follow -up, too. I’m not going to ask you whether\nwe’re in a bond bubble. But obviously, the new guidance that you’ve given in the FOMC statement is going to give a lot more clues to people who own bonds about when they might start\nlightening up their bond portfolios and changing the composition of what they own. Was\n\nconcerns about information about bond prices and things happening in a big hurry, in terms of\nsome sort of a bubble popping —was that a consideration in adding this transparency?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I wouldn’t say it was an important motivation for adding\ntransparency. I think transparency has a lot of value. But it is the —it is a f act that this greater\nclarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave. As we go forward in time,\nif the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer -term bond yields to begin to rise. And the more\ninformation we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they’ll have about the likely path of\nbonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment. So I think that’s a positive aspect of this communication. It —I wouldn’t say it was the major reason. The major reason is to give the\nmarkets and the public more transparency about what’s determining our policy, but that is one potential advanta ge.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, you said\na moment ago that these thresholds are based on an analysis of optimal policy. In the optimal\npolicy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, i t showed the first rise\nin interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that. Is that the policy that the Fed is now following? And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory remarks. In that case, how will we ever know that the\ninflation threshold has been hit? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman\nYellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we ’ve done. I mean, we ’ve run it for a\nvariety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models , and so on, but the general\n\ncharacter of that interest rate path, i.e. , that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of\n6½ or a little lower, and then rises relativ ely slowly, which goes back to the question that was\nasked earlier, that it doesn ’t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is\nreached. That is consistent with that kind of analysis, and that ’s the type of analysis that was not\nthe only thing we looked at but was informative in our discussion. You ’ll note also in that kind\nof policy path, of the type that she discussed , that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to\n2.\nIn terms of inflation forecast, the —what the C ommittee will do on a regular basis is\ninclude in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now. For example,\ncurrently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee’s objective in a long er term. The intellectual exercise we’ll be doing is asking ourselves if we\nmaintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we ex pect inflation to cross\nthe threshold or reach that level?\nNow, it’s very important that the public, the m edia, the markets find our projections\ncredible, obviously. And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation— I mentioned some in my\nopening remarks —outside forecasts , the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera.\nSo, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that. But my expectation is that our projections will be broadly consistent with public views, public\ninformation, and so I think we can manage the credibility issue. But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with.\n\nBINYAMIN APPLEBAUM. Sir, you’ve articulated more clearly than ever your\ncommitment to reduce unemployment, but you’ve also said that you’re not actually doing\nanything more to achieve that goal —that you still expect it to be three years away, that you’re\ndisappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor. What is the limiting factor? Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment? What would it take for you to get that?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we took —the question was whether this was\nsomething new relative to September, I think September was the date where we did do a substantial increase in accommodation. At that point, we announced our dissatisfac tion with the\nstate of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn’t improve. And what we’ve done today is really just following through what we\nsaid. So, I would say that, you know, looking at it f rom the perspective of September, that we\nhave, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation. The reason —one of the considerations though, as I’ve talked about, is that, you know,\ngiven that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more —somewhat more\ncomplicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate. You know, there are concerns that I’ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of market functioning. And the Committee takes these r isks very seriously. And they impose a\ncertain cost on policy that doesn’t exist when you’re dealing only with the federal funds rate. And so what we’re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower\n\nunemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that\nthere’s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account.\nBINYAMIN APPLEBAUM. Sir, if I can just follow, so these forecasts presumably\nincorporat e the actions taken into account, and so given those actions, it will still be three years\nuntil you achieve your goals. Is the message to people who are unemployed basically, “We are\ndoing all we can? ” Is this the conclusion that , given that balance of factors, this is the most we\ncan expect?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first of all, again, these —the projections that you’re\nlooking at are based on each individual —this is not a Committee collective projection. What\nthey are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy. So, for exa mple, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn’t be\ndoing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well. So, it’s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemplo yment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are\nconstraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet.\nDARREN GERSH. To just —Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report . So just following\nup on that last question, how helpful would it be to see , as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, some\nnear-term stimulus? The President’s proposed that. Do you think—how helpful do you think\nthat would be and, I’ll ask my follow up now, whatever happened to your southern accent?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, on the second one, I’d like to think I’m bilingual.\nWhen I go home sometimes I —it comes out pretty strongly, but I won’ t try to do that here. So, I\n\ntry to be careful, as you know, not to give views on specific tax and spending programs. I think,\nof course , obviously those are the province of the Administration and Congress. The attitude\nI’ve taken has been that , at a minimum, Congress should try to do no harm, that they should try\nto avoid policies that significantly slow or derail the recovery at this point. So I think that ’s the\ncritical thing along with the long -term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path. Now,\ngiven that basic recommendation, you know, Congress can consider variations. For example, if\nthey believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term. But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue support ive fiscal policy in the short term while maintaining the\ncredibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term.\nAnd that is I think really a question for them and for their staff.\nKRISTINA PETERSON. Kristina Peterso n of Dow Jones. Looking over the past year or\nseveral years, how would you evaluate the Fed’s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it’s connected to the thresholds?\nCHAIR MAN BERNANKE. Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the\npace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have had therefore —had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth. But\ninterestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any\nmeans, but we’ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment. And how do you reconcile those two things? I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New York Economic\nClub recently, right before Thanksgiving. And I think the reconciliation is that what we’re\n\nlearning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the\nunderlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy. It has interfered with business creation,\nwith investment, with technological advances, and so on. And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth. At the same time, though, what —of course, what monetary\npolicy influences is not potent ial growth, not the underlying structural growth. That’s for —\nmany other different kinds of policies affect that. What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy. And there, I think we’ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we’ve been much closer there. And I think therefore that we’ve been able to address that somewhat more effectively with quite accommodative policies. That being s aid, of course, we have over\ntime, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did\nin September, have added accommodation and we’ve continued— we continue to reassess the\noutlook. I think it’s only fair to say that e conomic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very,\nvery difficult. And what we basically are trying to do is create a plausible scenario which we think is reasonably likely —base policy on that, but we prepared to adjust as new information\ncomes in and as the outlook changes, and inevitably it will.\nGREG IP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Ip of the Economist . Economists have long\nbelieved that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run. That ’s one\nreason you’ ve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.\nCan you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to a n unemployment\nthreshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view? And , if it’ s\nconsistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only ? And would the\napproach that you ’re now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’s entirely consistent w ith your view, with the point\nthat you made. So let me just reiterate it. As we stated , in fact , in our January set of principles ,\nthe central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run. I’d add a caveat to this. There’ s\na little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere\nwith the workings of the labor market. And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long -term\nunemployment rate. But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline,\nthe long -term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy\nand a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy. So that being said, what our 6½ percent threshold is is —as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target —what it is is a\nguidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin. It\ncould be later than that, but at least b y that time, no earlier than that time. So it ’s really more like\na reaction function or a Taylor rule , if you will. I don’t want —I’m—I’ll get— I’m ready to get\nthe phone call from John Taylor. It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation. So, what it’s basically doing is saying how our policy will e volve over time as the economy evolves. It has no\nimplication that we can affect the long -run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than\n6½ percent. We think it ’s somewhere between 5 and 6 according to our SEP projections. We\nare a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful. So, I understand your point but I think that it ’s—that providing information on\nunemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets , to the public that allows\nthem to infer how our policy is likely to evolve.\n[Speaker unknown; inaudible remark]\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Unless —so long as the inflation condition is met. It’s\ncorrect.\nWYATT ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, Wyatt Andrews, CBS News. I’d like —still like to\nhear a little bit more about why you made this announcement today specifically tying federal\nfunds and your policy to the 6.5 percent number? I’m sure you have some sort of theory about\nwhat you hope changes in the economy as a result of thi s announcement. If so, what is it?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we think it’s a better form of communication. We\nthink it’s —by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we’re more\ntransparent about what’s going to determine our policy in the future. The date -based guidanc e, it\nserved a purpose. But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date -based guidance,\nand we did change it a couple of times. But that was a nontransparent pr ocess. Nobody\nunderstood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook. And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior. I’m not saying it’s the best possible approach,\nthere may be other things we can do in the future. We’re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it’s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and prom ptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will\nbegin, and therefore, it’ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer. So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that\nwill tend to lower longer -term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy. So\nthat has an automatic stabilizer type effect. It kind of offsets adverse shocks. So it’s a better\nform of communication. As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting. And\n\nso—and frankly, given that it’s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good\nidea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference. So, we decided since we’re ready\nto go w hy not make the change earlier and get the benefit earlier.\nWYATT ANDREWS. As a quick follow- up, are you—did you see a level of uncertainty\nin the business community that you hope to solve by this announcement?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the\nbusiness community and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned. If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it’s pretty consistent with the mid -2015 da te-based guidance that we had been providing. So I’m not\nsaying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting, and what we were expecting. So that wasn’t really the issue. The\nproblem is th at, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the\nbetter, or for the worse, in the outlook ? Under the date -based guidance , that would require the\nCommittee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way. But under this threshold- based guidance, the markets and the business\ncommunity can make that calculation on their own and adjust that —their estimates of when rates\nwill begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee to give them a date. So we just think it’s a better approach.\nJOSH ZUMBRUN. Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun, Bloomberg News. By mid- 2015, the\nrecovery is going to be nearly six years old. The average postwar recovery has been a little less than five. We’re already banking on a very long expansion. You expect, by mid- 2015, the funds\nrate is going to be at zero percent, your balance sheet is potentially at $4 trillion. If the business\n\ncycle runs out of steam and you’ re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have\na forceful response in that situation?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep— we’ve\ninnovated quite a bit in the last few years and it ’s always possible we could find new ways to\nprovide support for the economy. But it’ s certainly true , I’ve —you know, there’s no doubt that\nwith interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide\nadditional accommodation is n ot unlimited and that that’s just a reality and that actually is an\nargument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now. I mean, it’s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unant icipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the zero bound earlier. So, exactly for\nthose reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the —when policy interest rates are close to zero,\nand the greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that’s an argument for\nbeing somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition.\nDONNA BORAK. Hi, Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Hi.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna B orak with American Banker . My question pertains to the\nVolcker Rule. Regulators, earlier this year , seemed cautiously optimistic that they ’d be able to\nfinalize a rule by the end of the year. However, that seems a bit unlikely at this point. And now, as you know, lawmakers are calling for a two -year implementation delay on the rule. Given the\nfact that it’s been such a lengthy process, can you tell us where things stand at this point? How much closer are we to a rule? Have the agencies been ab le to work out their differences ?\nAnd, if you may, a prediction on when we might actually see a rule.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We’ve made quite a bit of progress. It’s a difficult,\ncomplex rule, as you know, and we’ve had, I think I recall, 18,000 comments or something like\nthat. So it’s been a lot to look at. There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know,\nforeign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera. So there’s been a lot of work to do. There, I think there is quite a bit of agreement, I wouldn’t say a agreement, but\nquite a bit of agreement on key points among the regulators, at this juncture. And, of course, if Congress gives us some other instruction, we’ll follow that, but so far, we haven’t received any different instruction. So it’s our intent to try to get this done early in 2013.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman. Since your last press\nconference with us, we’ve had an election. One of the candidates in that election, Governor Romney, said that he would not reappoint you to a third term as Chairman. President Obama did\nnot weigh in on the issue but he was —he did win reelection. If the President were to call you\nand say, “Ben, your country needs your continued stewardship at the Fe deral Reserve. We need\nyou to stay and finish the job, see this through.” Would you consider it? Would you do it, and, by chance, have you had any conversations to that effect with the President or anybody on his team? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So to answer the last part, no, I haven’t had any\nconversations. I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on. From my own perspective, I just, I really don’t have an ything to add from the last press conference. I am very much engaged in these\ndifficult issues that we’re discussing today, and I have not been spending time thinking about my own future. So I don’t really have anything to add there.\n\nKEVIN HALL. Okay, M r. Chairman. Thank you. The two questions, taking the\nGoldfarb rule into effect, one having to do with the CPI, there’s a lot of debate now with the\nBoehner plan about this chained CPI. As an econ —not as a Fed Chairman but as an\neconomist —is there a log ic in going to that? Do you think it’s a move that should be done\nseparate from the politics of it? And again, with your economist hat, the labor market, you talked about the importance, not looking at the 6.5 percent threshold, but the broader conditions. A big debate—Steve Liesman’s nemesis talks a lot about people being beamed to Mars. In your mind, what is happening in the job market? Are we creating jobs? Is that why it’s coming down or is it because people —the degree of discouraged workers? Wha t is your sense of how quickly\nit’s fallen because of new employment?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the\nfixed -weight CPI is a technical issue. The chained CPI is technically better, according to most\neconomists, bec ause it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually\nconsume more effectively. However, whether, you know, whether that’s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that’s ultimately a political decisio n. I suppose a\nrejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients. So, those are the kinds of questions that Congress is going to have to deal wi th. Second part of your question was?\nKEVIN HALL. The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling\nfrom —\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Ah, yes. Sorry.\nKEVIN HALL. New jobs versus people leaving.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes. Well, you know, you can see the comparison by\nlooking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are\nadded to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it’s true that part of the decline in unemployment —and indeed all of it in the last\nreading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force. Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer -run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women. So\nthose things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example. But beyond that downward trend, there’s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force. So that certainly is part of the issue. That being said, obviously there has\nbeen a good bit of job creation. Y ou can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll\nestablishment survey. So I think there’s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there’s not any question about that. But it’s also the case t hat\nmany indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long -term\nunemployed to the number of people who have part -time work who would like full -time work.\nWage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on. So, it may be that the labor market is\neven a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago.\nCATHERINE HOLLANDER. Mr. Chairman, Catherine Hol lander from National\nJournal . How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to\nreach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency? Is there a Wall Street –Washington disconnect?\n\nCHAIRMAN BER NANKE. Interesting question. Well, I certainly hope that markets\nwon’t have to tank. I don’t —we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses\nand households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming\nto a solution as quickly as possible. Markets have obviously already responded to some extent,\nup and down; you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations. But\non the other hand, it’s also true , if you look at the experience , I think the very informative\nexperience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raise d. And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly\nto confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the debates. So it’s not unusual to see markets being complacent. Of course, there’s from a market point of view, there are sor t of risks\nin both directions. Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities. But again, just to reiterate, I don’t thin k any policymaker, including the Fed, should\nbe responding to markets. What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what’s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as w ell.\nSTEVE BECKNER. Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner of Market News International. With\nthe federal government borrowing roughly $1 trillion a year and now with the Fed on pace to buy roughly a trillion dollars a year in bonds, are you concerned about a public , and possibly global ,\nperception that the Fed is accommodating not just growth but accommodating federal borrowing needs, and are you concerned about what this might do to the Fed’ s credibility , and the\n\ncredibility of U.S. finances in general, and t he credibility of the dollar as the world’s leading\ncurrency?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first of all, just a couple of facts. The —we’re buying\nTreasuries and mortgage -backed securities, about half and half, roughly. So we’re buying\nconsiderably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstandi ng Treasuries\nthat the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because\nwhile our holdings have increased, so has the —obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands.\nSo it’s not quite evident that there has be en such a radical shift there. You know, we’ve been\nincreasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we’ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure. It’s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support. We’ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce\nthe size of our holdings and—whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future. So this is, again, only a temporary step. It would be quite a different matter if we were buying\nthese assets and holding them indefinitely. That would be monetization. We’re not doing that. We are very clear about our intentions. And I think up until now, it seems our credibility has been quite good. There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any —there’s no strong\nevidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on. So, this is one of the things tha t we have to look at. Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large\nbalance sheet. We want to be sure that there’s no misunderstanding, that there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet. That’s one of the things we have to look at, but as to this point, there just really is no evidence that people are taking it that way. And I guess it’s worth pointing out —of course we’ve been very focused on the United States\n\nhere, but we’re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet. The\nJapanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy.\nGREG ROBB. Last but not least, Greg Robb, MarketWatch. There seems to be growing\nevidence that some of the MBS purchases, the impact of the MBS purchases, are that banks are holding on to some of the gains and not passing them on to the borrowers. Is there anything you can do about that and are you concerned about that? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. S o the question is —just to restate your question —is about\nthe spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage -backed\nsecurities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that’s the question. Well, I have to\nmake sure everybody heard it, so you could answer. Our analysis suggests that it takes time —\ntwo points. The first point is that while we don’t expect a hundred percent pass -through of MBS\nyields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis —and we’ve had quite a bit of\nwork done on this issue —suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields\ndoes get passed through to mortgage r ates. So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit\nwill, or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers. And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates. But one thing that’s perh aps\nconfusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads. So, for example, ther e are capacity limitations, which are allowing\nbanks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there’s extra costs like concerns about putback risk,\n\nfor example. There’s higher g -fees. So there’s a number of things happening in the economy\nwhich will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so\nthat’s unfortunate. What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans. But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g -fees, for exampl e, are\nnot really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage customers and thereby strengthen the housing\nmarket."
