The Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) concluded a two -day meeting earlier today. As you already know from our statement,\nthe Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent\nand to make no ch ange in either its asset purchase program or its forward guidance regarding the\nfederal funds rate target. I will discuss the rationales for our decision in a moment.\nEconomic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace, with continued—\nalbeit somewhat uneven —improvement in labor market conditions. Of course, to say that the\njob market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory . Notably, at\n7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels. Long -term\nunemployment and underemployment remain high. And we have seen ongoing declines in labor\nforce participation, which likely reflects discouragement on the part of many potential workers as\nwell as longer -term influences , such as the aging of the population.\nIn the Committee’s assessment, the downside risks to growth have diminished , on net,\nover the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of househol ds and firms in the staying\npower of the U.S. recovery . However, the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent\nmonths , if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market.\nIn addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk.\nApart from some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has\ncontinued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term objective . The Committee\nrecogniz es that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 performance, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely. However, the\nunwinding of some transitory factors has led to mode rately higher inflation recently, as expected .\nAnd, with longer -term inflation expectations well anchored , the Committee anticipates that\ninflation will gradua lly move back toward 2 percent.\nIn conjunction with this meeting, the 17 participants in our policy discussions —5 Board\nmembers and 12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted individual economic projections. As\nalways, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate\nmonetary policy. Also, at this meeting, we extended t he horizon of our projections through\n2016.\nGenerally, the projections of individual participants s how that they continue to expect\nmoderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards levels of\nunemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster\nmaximum employment and price stability. More specifically , participants’ projections for\neconomic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percen t in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016. For the unemployment rate, t he central\ntendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, declining to 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014 and, by 2016, to 5.4 to 5.9 percent —about the longer -run\nnormal level for the unemployment rate. Most participants see inflation gradually increasing\nfrom its current low level toward the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent . The central\ntendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.\nWith unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee’s\nlonger -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies. As you\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 know, in normal times , the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering its target for the short-\nterm policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds\nrate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot be lowered meaningfully further. Accordingly, the\nCommittee has been providing policy support to the economy through two complementary\nmethods: by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities\nand by communicating the C ommittee’s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the\nmedium term. I’ll discuss these tools in turn, beginning with our program of asset purchases.\nIn September 2012, the FOMC initiated a program of purchasing $40 billion per month in\nagency mortgage -backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer -term\nTreasury securities that we were already acquiri ng as part of our m aturity extension program.\nWe stated that , subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program,\npurchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor\nmarket in a context of price stability. In December 2012, we announced that we would continue\nto purchase $45 billion per month in longer -term Tre asuries after the m aturity e xtension program\nended later that month. Thus, our total purchases of longer -term securities were maintained at\n$85 billion per month, in addition to the reinvestment or rolling over of maturing securities on our balance sheet. The Committee agreed today to contin ue asset purchases at that rate, subject\nto the same conditions that we laid out a year ago.\nBecause the Committee tied its asset purchases to the outlook for the labor market, it’ s\nimportant to assess how that outlook has evolved. As I noted earlier, conditions in the job\nmarket today are still far from what all of us would like to see. Nevertheless, meaningful\nprogress has been made in the year since we announced the asset purcha se program. For\nexample, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent at the time of our announcement to\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 7.3 percent today, and about 2.3 million private -sector jobs have been created over the same\nperiod. Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly\nnew claims for unemployment insurance have fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that\nhouseholds perceive jobs as more readily available. Importantly, these gains were achieved\ndespite substantial fisc al headwinds, which are likely slowing economic growth this year by a\npercentage point , or more , and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs . Not all\nlabor market developments over the past year were positive, however; notably, the labor force\nparticipation rate fell by about 0.3 percentage points and real wages remained about flat.\nIn light of this cumulative progress, the FOMC concluded at our June meeting that the\ncriterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market might well be met over\nthe subsequent year or so . Accordingly, the Committee sought to provide more guidance on how\nthe pace of purchases might be adjusted over time. T he Committee anticipated in June that,\nsubject to certain conditions, it might be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchase s\nlater this year , continuing to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half\nof next year, and ending purchases around midyear 2014. However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the\neconomic outlook—in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee’s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards its 2 percent objective over time.\nAt the meeting concluded earlier today, the sense of the Committee was that the broad\ncontours of the medium -term economic outlook— including economic growth sufficient to\nsupport ongoing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving towards its objective —were\nclose to the views it held in June. But in evaluating whether a modest reduction in the pace of\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 asset purchases would be appropriate at this meeting, however, the Committee concluded that the\neconomic data do not yet provide sufficient confirmation of its baseline outlook to warrant such a reduction. Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further. Finally, the extent of the effects of restrictive fiscal policies remain unclear, and upcoming fiscal debates may involve additional\nrisks to financial markets and to the broader economy. In light of these uncertainties , the\nCommittee decided to await more evidence that the recovery’s progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases.\nThe Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic and financ ial\ndevelopments closely. As noted in today’s statement, i n judging when to moderate the pace of\nasset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming\ninformation continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing i mprovement in labor\nmarket conditions and inflation moving back towards its longer -run objective. However, as we\nhave said , and as today’s decision underscores, asset purchases are not on a preset course . The\nCommittee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the economic outlook and on the Committee’s ongoing assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of the program.\nLet me turn now to the FOMC’s forward guidance regarding the federal funds r ate. The\nCommittee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, so\nlong as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved as described in our statement .\nAs I have noted frequently, the economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate increase are thresholds, not triggers. For example, a decline in the unemployment rate to\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 6½ percent would not le ad automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but\nwould, instead , indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider\nwhether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase. The Committee would be\nunlike ly to increase rates if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for\nsome time, for example ; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into\naccount additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains . Thus, the first\nincreases in short -term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below\n6½ percent.\nThe projections of the path of the federal funds rate by individual Committee participants\nare generally consistent with this guidance. Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 ½ percent, 12 of the\n17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in\n2016.\nMost p articipants also see the funds rate target rising only very slowly after the process of\nremoving policy accommodation begins. The median projected funds rate for the end of 2015 is 1 percent. And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer -run normal values for those variables , the\nmedian projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 is 2 percent , well below the\nlonger -run normal value for the federal f unds rate of 4 percent or so projected by most\nparticipants . Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery\nwill abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patien t policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate\nbelow its longer -run normal value for some time.\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 Let me close by noting that although the FOMC is employing two instruments of\npolicy —asset purchases and forward guidance about s hort-term interest rates —the overall stance\nof monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation. Our program of asset\npurchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the conte xt of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was\ninitiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion. However, even after asset purchases are wound down—which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data —the Federal Reserve’s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings\nof securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nThank you, and I’d be glad to take your questions.\nPEDRO DA COSTA. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Pedro da Costa from Reuters . You cite\nmeaningful progress on the labor market both on the unemployment front and in terms of payroll growth . But much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been due , as you know , to the\ndecline in participation . So my question to you is —and also on the payroll front, some people\nwould argue that, while there has been growth, it hasn ’t been strong enough to ke ep up with\npopulation growth and make up the gap that we have from the recession . So, how high do you\nthink the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation ? I’ve heard estimates\nas high as 10 to 11 percent . And could you put th e labor market in that context?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Certainly . So, I think there is a cyclical component to\nparticipation , and , in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true\nunemployment , if you will , in the economy . But o n the other hand, there is also a downward\ntrend in participation in our economy , which is arising from factors that have been going on for\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 some time , including an aging population, lower participation by prim e-age males, fewer women\nin the labor force —other factors which aren ’t really related to this recession .\nOver the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight -tenths of a percentage\npoint . The participation rate has dropped by three -tenths of a percentage point, which is pretty\nclose to the trend . So, in other words, I think it would be fair to s ay that most of the\nimprovement in the unemployment rate —not all, but most of it in the last year —is due to job\ncreation rather than lower participation . I would also note that if you look at the broader\nmeasures of unemployment that the BLS publishes , including part -time work, including\ndiscouraged workers and so on, you’ ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as\nthe overall standard civilian unemployment rate . So I think that there has been progress , and it ’s\nobscure d to some extent by the downward trend in participation. But I also would agree with\nyou that the unemployment rate, while perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor\nmarket , is not by itself a fully re presentative indicator.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM . Binya App elbaum, the New York Times . To what extent do\nyou regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted? Was\nit a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your\nguidance that it will be appropriate ? Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down\nasset purchases by the end of this year?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So to answer the first part of your question, I think ther e’s\nno alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible , and that ’s\nwhat we tried to do. As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions ,\nand the C ommittee thought that was the time to begin talking ab out how the eventual wind- down\nof the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables .\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total\nwind -down to take place and w hich, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification —so to\nspeak —of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market . So all of\nthat was very consistent with what we said when we began the program , that our goal was to\nachieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , and we needed to\ncommunicate how that was going to be put into practice . Failing to communica te that\ninformation would have risked creating a large divergence bet ween market expectations, public\nexpectations, and what the C ommittee intentions were , and that could have led to much more\nserious problems down the road. So I think the communication was very important .\nThe general framework —to answer the other part of your question, the general\nframework in which we ’re operating is still the same . We have a three- part baseline projection ,\nwhich involves increasing growth that ’s picking up over time as fiscal drag is reduced,\ncontinuing gains in the labor market , and inflation moving back towards objective . We are\nlooking to see —in the coming meetings, we ’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic\noutlook. If it does, we ’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year —and then\ncontinue so long as the data are consistent with that continued progress . And so that basic\nstructure is still in place .\nBut what I want to emphasize is really two things . First, as I ’ve said, asset purchases are\nnot on a preset course, they are conditional on the data . They’ve always been conditional on the\ndata. And , secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal\ntool of monetary policy , it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide\nthe support necessary fo r our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens.\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 JON HILSENRATH. Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Just to follow up on\nBinya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull back the purchases possibly later\nthis year . You sound a little bit less certain that it’ s going to happen later this year . So I ’d like\nyou—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like —the\npullback is likely to start this year, wh ere do you stand on that ? And I also don’ t think I heard\nyou mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ ve talked —you talked about back\nin June . That was the rate that was —the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when\nthe Fed was done doing this . Is that no l onger operative?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So ther e is no fixed calendar —schedule, I really have to\nemphasize that . If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook\nand we believe that the three- part test that I mentioned is ind eed coming to pass, then we could\nmove later this year , we could begin later this year . But even if we do that, the subsequent steps\nwill be dependent on continued progress in the economy . So we are tied to the data—we don ’t\nhave a fixed calendar schedul e—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in\nJune.\nThe criterion for ending the asset purchases program is a substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market . Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you\nsome sense of, you know, where that might be . But, as my first answer suggested, the\nunemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in all circumstances , of the state of the\nlabor market overall . For example, just last month, the decline in the unemployment rate came\nabout more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs . So\nwhat we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 rate, but including other factors as well . But , in particular, there is not any magic number that we\nare shooting for . We ’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman , with CNBC . Mr. Chairman, one question—just\nthree parts , if you don ’t mind . Have you indicated to President Obama you did not want to serve\na third term? If so, when ? Or did President Obama i ndicate to you he did not want you to serve\na third term? A nd those two parts notwithstanding, would you serve a third term if asked, either\nwholly or in part ? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Wel l, it’s convenient because I have the same answer to all\nthree parts of your question. If you will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about\nmy plans at this point . I hope to have more infor mation for you at some reasonably soon date,\nbut today I want to focus on monetary policy . I’d prefer not to talk about my own plans.\nYLAN MUI . Ylan Mui, Washington Post . You mentioned that tighter fiscal conditions\nare a concern for the C ommittee as yo u guys think about whether or not it ’s appropriate to\nreduce asset purchases . What do you all expect to be able to do in the future , when you actually\ndo begin to pull back in your asset purchases , to manage expectations and manage the market\nreactions su ch that we don ’t see another increase in rates?\nCHAIRMAN BERNAKE . What’s the relationship between the pullback and fiscal\npolicy?\nYLAN MUI . Oh, I ’m sorry . I meant financial conditions, tighter financial conditions.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure . Well, I think part of\nthe reaction we’ ve seen —and it comes from a number of sources —part of it comes from\nimproved economic news and that’ s part of the reason why rates have gone up in other countries\nas well as in the United S tates. And that —to the extent that tighter financial conditions reflect a\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 better outlook, that ’s a good thing , and that ’s not a problem at all . Part of it reflects views about\nmonetary policy , and that we want to make sure we get straight . And that ’s wh y—to answer the\nearlier question, again, it ’s why communication is so important . We need to explain , as best we\ncan, how we ’re going to move and on what bas is we’re going to move . It’s much more difficult\ntoday than it was 20 years ago because the tools are more complex so they ’re less familiar, but\nthat’s still very important .\nI think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and\nlevered positions in the markets , and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that t hose\nunwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred. Now,\nthe tightening associated with that is , to some extent , unwelcome, but , on the other hand, to the\nextent that some of the riskier, more lever ed positions have been eliminated, I think that makes\nthe situation more sustainable and reduces , at least , the risk that there will be an over -strong\nreaction to further announcements .\nSo we will do our best to communicate clearly . That is our goal and our objective . The\nmore clearly we communicate, the better the chance that markets will understand our intentions and that we can avoid any sharp movements . But , again, we ’re dealing with tools that are less\nfamiliar , harder to quantify, and harder to com municate about than the traditional funds rate.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding , from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, the\nmedian C ommittee member expect s a 2 percent interest rate at the end of 2016 , and , in the long\nrun, they expect interest rates to return to 4 percent . Can you give us any sense of when you and\nwhen the C ommittee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Let me first restate the—I think the key point here , which is\nthat the large majority of the pa rticipants of the FOMC , including voting and nonvoting members\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 who a re asked to describe their own assessment of optimal policy —the large majority of them\nestimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around\n2 percent , even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment , according\nto our best projections . The reason for that —there may be possibly several reasons, but we did\ndiscuss this in the C ommittee today —the primary reason for that low value is that we expect that\na number of factors —including the slow recovery of the housing sector , continued fiscal drag,\nperhaps continued effects from the f inancial crisis —may still prove to be headwinds to the\nrecovery . And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using\nrates lower than , sort of , the long -run normal . So, in other words, in economics terms, the\nequilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time\nbecause of these h eadwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth .\nSo that ’s why we expect to see growth that —I mean , rates at an unusually low level . I\nimagine it would take a few more years after that to get to the 4 percent level . I couldn’ t be\nmuch more precis e than that —I mean , we’re already obviously stretching the bounds of\ncredibility to talk about specific projections to 2016. But I think you would expect to see that\nrates would gradually rise for the two or three years after 2016 and ultimately get to 4 percent.\nJOSH ZUMBRUN. Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News . You\nindicated that you can see the F ed lowering the pace of purchases once the economy starts to\ngrow faster, in line with what the F ed’s projected . For about the past four years, the F ed has\nbeen projecting that growth would quicken to about 3 percent , and it never has . So, at what point\nare you decide —going to decide that other c osts and benefits are the reason that you ’re making\nthe decision ? Are we getting close to that having to be a deciding factor even if you don’ t get the\ngrowth forecast , the way you have n’t the past four years ? And does the complication of this —\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 this is kind of a second question, but I’m going to do it anyway—does the complication of this\nmean that you nee d a press conference to make a tapering decision?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, you’ re certainly right that we have been over -\noptimistic about out -year growth . There are a number of reasons for that . One reason for it,\nthough, is that it appears —and I talked about this in a speech last year —it appears that , as part of\nthe aftermath of the financial crisis , that , at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the\neconomy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at the same\nrate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is\nslower, et cetera. So it appears , again , that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been\nslowed somewhat , at least temporarily , by the recessi on and the financial crisis , and you can see\nthat in the slower productivity figures .\nNow, we have —you know, we haven’ t anticipated that slowdown in productivity , and\nthat’s one of the main reasons why we haven ’t anticipated the relatively slow growth . Now, it ’s\nimportant to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long -run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and\nemployment from its normal level. And in predicting the amount of slack in the economy , so to\nspeak, we ’ve done a little better . Our predictions of unemployment , for example, ha ve been\nbetter than our predictions of growth. A nd, in particular, one thing that ’s been quite striking is\nthat unemployment —we were too p essimistic on unemployment for this year . Unemployment\nhas fallen faster than we anticipated . So, in that respect, we were too pessimistic rather than too\noptimistic . So, we ’ll continue to do the best we can. We ’re looking , again , to see confirmation\nof our broader scenario , which basically is that we ’ll continue to see progress in the labor market ,\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 that growth will be sufficient to support that progress , and th at inflation will be moving back\ntowards target , and that ’s what wi ll determine our policy decisions .\nIn terms of press conferences, I think it ’s important to say that there ’s an understanding in\nthe C ommittee that we ’ve had for a while , that there are eight “ real” meetings every year —that\nevery meeting is a meeting in which any policy decisio n can be taken . And , should anything\noccur at a meeting without a scheduled press conference that requires additional explanation, we\ncertainly could arrange a public , on-the-record conference call or some other way of answering\nthe media ’s questions.\nGRE G IP. Greg Ip of the Economist . You said that you—the C ommittee would be\nunlikely to raise the federal funds rate if inflation remains below target, but your own projections have inflation—that ’s the midpoint of your inflation projections —below your 2 pe rcent target\nthrough 2016. S o is that inconsistent with the liftoff in the federal funds rate in that period ?\nAnd, related, is there a case to be made that your threshold s should be supplemented with a\nlower bound for the inflation rate —i.e. , you won’ t tighten if inflation is at or below some lower\nbound?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’ re seeing\ninterest rate projections and inflation projections separately . You’re not seeing them combined\nby individuals . Each individual is making their own projection . I think you’ re right, I mean, that\nwe should be very reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target , and that ’s\none of the reasons that I think we can be very patient in raising the feder al funds rate since we\nhave not seen any inflation pressure .\nOn having an inflation floor , that would be in addition to the guidance . We are\ndiscussing how we might clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate . That is certainly one\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 possibility . I guess an interesting question there is whether we need additional guidance on that ,\ngiven that we do have a target . And , of course , implicit in our policy strategy is trying to reach\nthat target for inflation, but that —an inflation floor is certainly something that, you know, could\nbe a sensible modification or addition to the guidance.\nVICTORIA McGRANE . Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones Newswires . Many investors\nwere expecting the Fed to move at least a little bit in pulling back the bond -buying program\ntoday . Given that you all decided not to do that , are—do you have any concerns that , once again,\nthe F ed is confusing investors and sending mix ed signals?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I don’ t recall stating that we would do any par ticular\nthing in this meeting . What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy . And our\nassessment of the data since June is that , taken collectively , that it didn ’t quite meet the standard\nof satisfying our —or of ratifying or confirming our basic outlook for , again, increasi ng growth ,\nimproving labor markets , and inflation moving back towards target . We try our best to\ncommunicate to markets —we ’ll continue to do that —but we can ’t let market expectations dictate\nour policy actions . Our policy actions have to be determined by our best assessment of what ’s\nneeded for the economy.\nPETER BARNES . Peter Barnes, Fox Business , sir. You mentioned fiscal issues in the\nstatement today . Are you concerned about a government shutdown? We’re hearing more about\nthat possibility . Did tha t come up in your discussions at this meeting ? W hat do you think w ould\nbe the impact of a government shutdown on the economy , and what could the F ed’s—or, would\nthe F ed be prepared to respond to that and help the economy with additional accommodation , for\nexample, additional asset purchases ? Thank you.\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, a fact or that did concern us in our discussion was\nsome upcoming fiscal policy decisions . I would include both the possibility of a government\nshutdown, but also the debt limit is sue. These are obviously, you know, part of a very\ncomplicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles, et cetera, which I won ’t get into . But\nit is the case , I think, that a government shutdown —and perhaps , even more so , a failure to raise\nthe debt limit—could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the\neconomy , and the Federal Reserve’ s policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on\ncourse . And so, if these actions led the economy to slow, then we would have to take that into\naccount , surely . So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy . That\nbeing said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited, particularly a debt\nlimit shock. And I think it ’s extraordinarily important that Congress and the A dministration\nwork together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded, public services are\nprovided, that the government pays its bills , and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011,\nwhich had, at least for a time, a noticeable adverse effect on confidence and on the economy.\nANNALYN KURTZ . Annalyn Kurtz , with CNNMoney . This week marks five years\nsince the financial crisis began , and Hank Paulson, who you ’ve worked very closely with, has\nsaid his biggest regret was that he wasn’ t able to convince the Ame rican people that what was\ndone — the bank bailouts —weren ’t for Wall Street, they were for Main Street . What is your\nbiggest regret as you reflect on the five -year anniversar y? And do you believe that the F ed,\nCongress , and the P resident have put the necessary measures in place to prevent another deep\nfinancial crisis?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra says, I have many . I\nthink my —you know, reasonably , the biggest regret I have is that we didn ’t forestall the crisis . I\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 think once the crisis got going, it was extremely hard to prevent . You know, I think we did what\nwe could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated\nentirely by the interest of the broader public , that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so\nthat it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more —that would have been even more severe by many\ntimes than what we actually saw . So I agree with him on that . And I guess, since you gave me\nthe opportunity, I would mention that, of course, all the money that was used in those operations has been paid back with int erest . And so, it hasn ’t been costly , even from a fiscal point of view .\nNow, in terms of progress, that ’s a good question. I think we ’ve made a lot of progress .\nWe had, of course, the Dodd–Frank l aw passed in 2010, and then we recently, you know, have\ncome to agreement i nternationally on a number of measures , including Basel III and other\nagreements relating to the shadow banking system and other aspects of the financial system . I\nthink that our —today, our large financial firms, for example, are better capitalized by far than\nthey were certainly during the crisis and even before the crisis . Supervision is tougher . We do\nstress testing to make sure that firms can withstand not only normal shocks , but very, very large\nshocks , similar to those they experienced in 2008. An d, very importantly, of course, we now\nhave a to ol that we didn’ t have in 2008—which would have made , I think, a signific ant\ndifference if we had had it —which is the orderly l iquidation a uthority that the Dodd–Frank bill\ngave to the FDIC in collaboration with the F ed. Under the orderly l iquidation a uthority, the\nFDIC , with other agencies , has the ability to wind down a failing financial firm in a way that\nminimizes the direct impact on the financial markets and on the economy .\nNow, I should say, I don’ t want to overstate the case— I think there ’s a lot more work to\nbe done . In the case of resolution regimes, for example, the United States has set the course\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 internationally . Other countries and international bodies like the FSB are setting up standards f or\nresolution regimes, which are very similar to those of the United States, which is going to make\nfor better cooperation across borders . But we ’re still some distance from being fully geared up\nto work with foreign counterparts to successfully wind down an international—multinational financial firm. And that ’s—we ’ve made progress in that direction , but we need to do more , I\nthink. So, I think there ’s more to be done . There ’s more to be done on derivatives, although a\nlot has been done to make them mor e transparent and to make the trading of derivatives safer .\nBut it’ s going to be probably some time before, you know, all of this stuff that has been\nundertaken, all of these measures are fully implemented . And we can assess, you know, the\nultimate impac t on the financial system.\nSTEVE BECKNER . Steve Beckner of MNI , Mr. Chairman . A number of economists ,\nand, indeed, some of your F ed colleagues , have argued that the effectiveness of quantitative\neasing has greatly diminished , if not disappeared, and they point to the rec ent performance of the\neconomy a s proof of that . And there have been a number of people who have argued that there\nare regulatory and other impediments to growth beyond the reach of monetary policy . To what\nextent are these valid arguments ? And if the economy does not speed up, if it does not reach\nyour objectives, how will you ever get out of quantitative easing?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it ’s\ndifficult to get a precise measure . There ’s a large academic literature on this subject, and they\nhave a range of results, s ome suggesting that this is a quite powerful tool, some that it’ s less\npowerful . My own assessment is that it has been effective. If you look at the recovery, you see\nthat some of the strongest sectors, the leading sectors like housing and autos, have been interest-\nsensitive sectors . And that these policies have been successful in strengthening financial\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 conditions, lowering interest rates, and thereby promoting recovery . So I do think that they have\nbeen effective. You mentioned that there hasn’ t been any progress . There has been a lot of\nprogress . As I said at the beginning , labor market indicators, while still not where we ’d like\nthem to be , are much better today than they were when we began this latest program a year ago .\nAnd, importantly —as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement —that happened\nnotwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and\n1½ percentage points of real grow th and hundreds of thousands of jobs . So the fact that we have\nmaintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year,\nnotwithstanding this fiscal drag , is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from\nmonetary policy .\nNow, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can’t\naddress . They include the effectiveness of regulation, they include fiscal policy, they include\ndevelopments in the private sector . We do what we can do and what —if we can get help, we ’re\ndelighted to have help from other policymakers and from the private sector and we hope that that will happen. The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth . What it is is the criterion —let me just remind you, the criterion is a substantial\nimprovement in the outlook for the labor market , and we have made significant improvement .\nUltimately, we will reach that level of substantial improvement, and at that point, we wil l be able\nto wind down the asset purchases . Again, you know, and I think people don’ t fully appreciate\nthat we have two tools : We have asset purchases , and we have rate policy and guidance about\nrates . It’s our view that the latter, the rate policy , is actually the stronger, more reliable tool .\nAnd when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full employment that rate policy will be sufficient, I think that we will still be able to provide —even\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 if asset purchases are reduced —we will still be able to provide a highly accommodative\nmonetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full\nemployment.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman, Donna Borak, with American Banker . The Financial\nStability Oversight Council has already designated t wo nonbank firms as SIFIs , as you know,\nand potentially a third very soon, and presumably others to follow . However, little has been said\nin terms of how specifically these firms will be regulated by the F ed, which has bee n a chief\ncriticism of the entire process . Given that, can you provide us any guidance at this point in terms\nof how far along the F ed is in terms of letting the banks know how they will be regulated\nbesides, you know, tailoring the plans ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNAN KE. Well, the two firms that ha ve been designated, AIG and GE\nCapital , actually are—ha ve been regulated by the Fed, because both of them are savings and\nloan, thrift holding companies . So we have a lot of already experience with those firms and a lot\nof contact with those firms . We will—I want to use the word “ tailored ” because we want to\ndesign a regime that is appropriate for the business model of the particular firm. But our other objective , and what makes designation by the FSOC particularly notewor thy, is that the primary\ngoal of the consolidated supervision by the Fed is to make sure that the firms —the firm doesn’ t\nin any way endanger the stability of the broad financial system . So we ’ll be looking at not just\nthe usual safety and soundness type m atters or supervision, which both can be , again , tailored to\nthe types of assets and liabilities that the firm has, but also we ’re going to want to focus on things\nlike resolution authority, practices relating to derivatives and other exposures, interconne ctedness , et cetera, to make sure that the firm in its structure and in its operations\ndoesn’ t pose a threat to the wider system . And that ’s what is going to be distinctive about our\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 oversight , not only of these designated firms , but also of the large bank holding companies that\nwe already oversee and which we are already subjecting to tougher supervision, higher capital,\nstress tests, and all the rest.\nPETER COOK . Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television, Mr. Chairman . One of my\ncolleagues was remarking as we came in here, we don’ t often get surprises from the Federal\nReserve. This was a surprise, you talked about —you hadn’ t telegraphed anything specifically,\nbut you’ ve seen the market reaction , I’m sure . My question for you is , were you intending a\nsurprise today , and did you get the intended result , judging from the market reaction ? And\nrelated to that, by taking this action today —continuing the bond purchases going forward— at\nwhat point do you believe you ’re starting to complicate the exit strategy ? Simply by continuing\nto keep the F ed’s foot on the gas pedal, do you make life more complicated for the Federal\nReserve down the road?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, it’ s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for\nthe econom y, as I said earlier . We are somewhat concerned . I won ’t overstate it, but we do want\nto see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy , particularly in mortgage rates , on\nhousing . So to the extent that our policy makes conditions —our policy de cision today makes\nconditions just a little bit easier, that’ s desirable. We want to make sure that the economy has\nadequate support and, in particular, it’s less surprising the market or easing polic y as it is\navoiding a tightening until we can be comfor table that the economy is in fact growing, you\nknow, the way we want it to be growing . So this was a step —it was a step , a precautionary step\nif you will. It was a —the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence\nwhether to the —to whether or not the economy is , in fact , conforming to this general outlook\nthat we have. I don’ t think that we are complicating anything for future FOMCs . It’s true that\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 the assets that we’ ve been buying add to the size of our balance sheet . But we have developed a\nvariety of tools , and we think we have numerous tools that we —can be used to both manage\ninterest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes . So I, you know,\nI’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can —in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the\nappropriate time , even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period . And that will\nbe true , of course , for, you know, future FOMCs as well.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from P olitico . Do you think that all\nof the recent attention being paid to who will be your replacement has h ad any immediate effect\non the F ed, and could it have any lingering effect on your successor ? And also, do you think the\nprocess has just become too politicized , or is this part of a healthy debate?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional\ncredibility . And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it ’s independent, it ’s\nnonpartisan, and I ’m not parti cularly concerned about the political environment for the Federal\nReserve. I think the Fed will be —continue to be an important institution in the United States ,\nand that it will maintain its independence going forward.\nGREG ROBB . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gre g Robb, MarketWatch . Was there a\ndiscussion among the C ommittee today about changing the forward guidance, the 6.5 percent\njobless rate ? And could you say why the C ommittee decided to hold that steady in light of the\nweaker economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANK E. Wel l, as I mentioned earlier, the C ommittee has regularly\nreviewed the forward guidance, and there are a number of ways in which the forward guidance\ncould be strengthened . For example, Mr. Ip mentioned an inflation floor . There are other steps\nthat we could take . We could provide more information about what happens after we get t o\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 6.5 percent and those sorts of things, and to the extent that we could provide precise guidance, I\nthink that would be desirable . Now, it ’s very important that we not tak e any of these steps\nlightly, that we make sure we understand all the implications , and that we are comfortable that it\nwill be —that any modifications of the guidance will be credible to markets and to the public .\nSo, we continue to think about options . Ther e are a number of options that we have talked about .\nBut today, we —as of today, we didn’ t choose to make any changes to the guidance.\nDON LEE . Don Lee, L.A. Times . As you may know, the Census Bureau reported\nyesterday that the poverty rate and the m edian household income saw no improvement last year .\nAnd I wonder , when you see median incomes turning up significantly for most people , and in\nlight of the fact that people in the middle and the bottom have seen very little of the gains relative to highe r income households, how would you assess the —both quantitative easing and\nFed policies?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Sure . So that ’s certainly the case that there are too many\npeople in poverty . There are a lot of complex issues involved. There are complex meas urement\nissues, I would just have to mention that . There are a lot of issues that are reall y long -term issues\nas well . For example, it might seem a puzzle that the U .S. economy gets richer and richer , and\nyet there are more poor people .\nAnd the explanation, of course, is that our economy is becoming more unequal . The\nmore very rich people and more people in the lower half who are not doing well, these are —\nthere’ s a lot of reasons behind this trend, which ha s been going on for decades, and econom ists\ndisagree about the relative importance of things like technology and international trade and\nunionization and other factors that have contributed to that . But I guess my first point is that\nthese long- run trends —it’s important to address these trends , but the Federal Reserve doesn ’t\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 really have the tools to address these long -run distributional trends . They can only be addressed\nreally by Congress and by the A dministration . And it ’s up to them, I think, to take those steps .\nThe Federal Reserve is —we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American,\nbecause one of our principal goals —we have two principal goals, one i s maximum employment,\njobs. The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities . We ’re still not\nsatisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is . We ’ll continue to try to\nprovide support for that . And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of\ncourse, also helps make the economy work better for people in the m iddle and the lower parts of\nthe distribution .\nSo we use the tools that we have . It would be better to have a mix of tools at work—not\njust monetary policy , but fiscal policy and other policies as well . But the Federal Reserve, we\ncan—you know, we only have a certain set of tools , and those are the ones that we use . Again,\nour objective —our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite\nconsistent with helping the average American, but there ’s limits to what we can do a bout long -\nrun trends , and I think those are very important issue s that Congress and the A dministration, you\nknow, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there.\nJEREMY TORDJMAN. Hi, Jeremy Tordjman , with AFP . Some emerging countries are\nblaming the Fed policies for the financial distress that they are experiencing . I wanted to have\nyour take on that . And also, how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering\nannouncement back in June ? Thank you very much.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, let me just talk about— I talk ed a little bit about the\ncommunication in June . Let me talk just about the emerging markets , which I think is an\nimportant issue . Let me just first say that we have a lot of economists w ho spend all of their time\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 looking at international aspects of monetary policy , and we spend a lot of time looking at\nemerging markets . I spend a lot of time talking to my colleagues in emerging markets . So we ’re\nwatching that very carefully . The Unit ed States is part of a globally integrated economic and\nfinancial system , and problems in emerging markets —or in any country , for that matter —can\naffect the United States as well . And so, again, we are watching those developments very\ncarefully .\nIt is tru e that changes in longer -term interest rates in the United States —but also in other\nadvanced economies —does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are\ntrying to pe g their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows . But there are\nalso other factors that affect inflows and outflows . Those include changes in risk preference by\ninvestors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within\nemerging markets across different countries . So there are a lot of factors that are there playing a\nrole, and that ’s one reason why different emerging markets have had different experiences . They\nhave different institutional structures and different policies . But , just to come to the bottom line\nhere, we think it ’s very important that emerging markets grow and are prosperous . We pay close\nattention to what ’s happening in those countries —it affects the United States .\nThe main point, I guess, I would end with, though , is that what we ’re trying to do with\nour monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize , is trying\nto create a stronger U .S. economy . And a stronger U .S. economy is one of the most important\nthings that could happen to help the economies of emerging markets . And, again, I think my\ncolleagues in many of the emerging markets appreciate that —not withstanding some of the\neffects that they may have felt —that efforts to strengthen the U .S. economy and other advanced\neconom ies in Europe and elsewhere ultimately redounds to the benefit of the global economy ,\n\nSeptember 18 , 2013 Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference \nPage 7 including emerging markets as well.\nThank you."
