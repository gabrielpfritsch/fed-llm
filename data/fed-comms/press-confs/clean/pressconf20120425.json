  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Good afternoon. Before we get to questions, I ’ll summarize\ntoday ’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then I ’ll place the Committee ’s\npolicy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the\nappropriate path of monetary policy .\nAs indicated in the statement r eleas ed earlier this afternoon, the Committee is\nmaintaining the highly accommodative policies that we initiated at previous meetings . We\ndecided to keep the target range for the f ederal funds r ate at 0 to ¼ percent , and we continue to\nanticipate that eco nomic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the f ederal\nfunds r ate at least through late 2014. Our program to extend the average maturity of the Federal\nReserve’ s securit y holdings —announced in September —will continue as scheduled. Each of\nthese policy actions is intended to foster accommodative financial conditions that support the economic recovery in a context of price stability .\nIn conjunction with today ’s meeting, FOMC participants —the 5 B oard members and the\n12 R eserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy\nassessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the long run. These projections serve as important inputs into the Committee ’s deliberations .\nIncoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately . Most\nCommittee participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and\nthen to pick up gradually . Among other factors, and not withstanding some signs of\nimprovement, the ongoing weakness of the housing sector still represents a headwind for recovery . Strains in global financial markets, though less pr onounced, generally , than last fall,\ncontinue to pose significant risks to the outlook.\n\nLabor market conditions have improved in recent months , with the unemployment rate\nhaving fallen nearly a percentage point since August . However, at 8.2 percent, the\nunemployment rate remains elevated . Looking ahead, the Committee anticipates that the\nunemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years , reflecting the moderate\npace of economic growth . Specifically, participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in\nthe fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent , declining to 6.7 to\n7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. For comparison, participants ’ estimates of the longer -\nrun normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent .\nInflation has picked up somewhat , mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices . However, as\nhas been the case for other recent swings in oil prices, the Committee expects that effect to be\nonly temporary . Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show\nstability in longer -term inflation expectations . Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will\nsubsequently run at or below the Committee ’s longer -run goal of 2 percent . In particular,\nparticipants ’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and\n1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014.\nThe economic projection s submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their\nindividual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy . As you can see from the\nchart labeled “ Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming, ” Committee participants have a range of\nviews about when the initial increase in the federal f unds r ate is likely to be appropriate .\nFollowing a careful discussion of those views at today ’s meeting, the FOMC maintained its\ncollective judgment t hat economic conditions will likely warrant exception ally low levels for the\nfederal f unds r ate at least through late 2014 . In particular, a highly accommodative stance of\n\nmonetary policy is warranted in light of the persistence of the factors restraining the pace of\nrecovery and the ongoing risks to the economic outlook.\nFinally, the Committee took no new decisions regarding the Federal Reserve ’s balance\nsheet today, but we remain prepared to adjust our securities holdings as appropriate to promote a\nstronger economic recovery in the context of price st ability .\nThank you. I’d be glad to take your questions.\nDARREN GERSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman . Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .\nSome of your critics —I’m sure you ’re not going to be surprised—think that you’ re still being too\ncautious , that unem ployment is still high, the economy may be slowing, inflation is subdued, and\nI know you just talked about the balance sheet . But given that, is the Committee now any closer\nto QE3 than it was at its last meeting?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , first, the Comm ittee has certainly been bold and\naggressive in terms of easing monetary policy . We ’ve maintained the f ederal f unds r ate close to\nzero since late 2008 . We’ ve had two rounds of so -called quantitative easing . We ’ve had a\nmaturity e xtension program , whic h is ongoing . We have offered guidance about the f ederal\nfunds r ate that goes into at least late 2014 .\nSo we ha ve been very accommodative , and we remain prepared to do more as needed to\nmake sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close to target. So , in particular,\nwe will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks ,\nwhether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its longer -run normal level,\nand whether inflation is remaining c lose to target . And, if appropriate , and depending also on\nassessment of the costs and risks of additional policy actions, we remain entirely prepared to take additional balance sheet actions if necessary to achieve our obj ectives . So those tools remain\n\nvery much on the table , and we will not hesitate to use them should the economy require that\nadditi onal support.\nJON HILSENRATH. Mr. Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street J ournal . The\nFed has been forecasting for some time that inflation would fall to 2 percent or below . The latest\nmeasures of inflation suggest that the core PC E is at the higher end of that range and many other\nmeasures are above 2 percent . I noticed that in your forecast today that the upper end of your\nforecast s all the way through 2014 have increased. Do you see a risk that the disinflationary\nforces in the economy might not be as strong as the Fed had been projecting for some time?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I would just say , first, that our projections still have\ninflation very close to our 2 percent target . As you point out, core inflation and some other\nmeasures of underlying inflation ha ve been a little stronger than expected . But I would say first\nthat some of the movement in the first quarter, for example, seems to h ave come from transitory\nsources like nonmarket components . And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation\nexpectations ; the amount of slack in the economy ; the commodity price behavior , which has\nbeen relatively well -controlled in recent mont hs—all of those things suggest that inflation is\ngoing to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target . Now, as I mentioned in the\nopening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a\ntemporary bulg e in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the\nsystem and , assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflati on ought to moderate to about\n2 percent later this year.\nJON HILSENRATH. Why did the lower bound in those forecast s rise?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . The lower bound rose —again, this represents 17 distinct\nviews —but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer , core\n\ninflation has been a little stronger than was expected . But those differences are not particularly\nlarge.\nPEDRO DA C OSTA . Mr. Chairman , Pedro da Costa from Reuters . So we know that the\nCommittee foresees rates staying very low until late 2014 . What is your personal view on the\ntiming of the first rate hike , on the likely timing ? And second, do you see the Committee as\nhaving an easing bias at the moment or is it neutral ? Could it go either way?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I ’m very comfortable with the consensus view that\nwe enunciated today , and I think that the Committee broadly is comfortable —a 9- to-1 vote in\nfavor of this guidance . So again, that represents a very accommodative stance of policy . Our\nintention is to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for the foreseeable future , and\nwe remain able and willing to take further action if necessary . At the same time, I think it is\nworth noting that the forward guidance on the f ederal f unds r ate is conditional on the data , and if\nthe data were to come in much stronger than expected, we would adjus t the guidance\nappropriately . So it ’s not unconditional ; it does depend on how the outlook evolves . And again,\nshould the outlook strengthen notably , then we would have to respond to that.\nPEDRO DA COSTA . How much more weakness would you need to see for QE3 to be in\nplace? W ould you need to see an actual recession take place?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . The question is, you know, “ How much more weakness do\nwe need ?” The Committee has to make those assessments , and we ’ve been working to try to\nprovide more -explicit guidance, quantitative guidance about our policy reaction function, but so\nfar, you know, we haven’ t really done that . And I can o nly say qualitatively that the Committee\nwill continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is\nmaking sufficient progress towards our objectives , and , in particular , whether the recovery is still\n\ncontinuing . And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to\nhelp make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer -run normal\nlevels.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr. Chairman , according to the latest f orecast, 10 members of the\nFOMC see a 1 percent or higher fed funds r ate in 2014; 7 of them see a 2 percent or higher f ed\nfunds r ate. Under that —those conditions, how can the guidance in the statement , that you\nremain exceptionally low through late 2014, be justified ? And is there a point at which the\ndissonance between the individual forecast s and the guidance get to a point where one or the\nother is no longer te nable ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, there ’s certainly a range of views , as you ’ve noted,\nbut these projections are inputs into a Committee process . And it ’s in the Committee meeting\nthat we had yesterday and today where we debate not only the poss ible outcomes, but also the\nrisks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collectiv e judgment . And as I said, the\nCommittee had no difficulty coming to a consensus that the guidance that we gave is still\nappropriate . Again, if there ’s a substa ntial change in the economic outlook in either direction,\nthen the guidance would change appropriately . But for now, I think the Committee is\ncomfortable with the consensus statement that we put out.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Do you worry about creating confusion i n the market between the\nguidance and the individual forecast s?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , again, the individual projections are inputs to the\nCommittee decision , so the Committee decision is the critical element in that respect. We are\ncontinuing to work to become more transparent , and we have a variety of things that we ’re\n\nlooking at, so you’ ll have to stay tuned for that . But again, the Committee was quite comfortable\nwith the consensus that we have reported today.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM . Unemployment is too high, and you said you expect it to\nremain too high for years to come . Inflation is under control , and you say that you expect it to\nremain under control . You sa y that you have additional tools available for you to use, but you’ re\nnot using them right now . Under these circumstances, it ’s really hard for a lot of people to\nunderstand why you are not using those tools right now . Could you address that ? And\nspecifically , could you address whether your current views are inconsistent with the views on\nthat subject that you held as an academic?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yeah . Let me tackle that second part first . So there ’s this\nview circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are\nsomehow inconsistent with our current policies . That is absolutely incorrect . Our —my views\nand our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time . I made\ntwo points at that time to the Bank of Japan . The first was that I believe that a determined\ncentral b ank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is , falling prices . The second\npoint that I made was that when short -term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are\nno longer —are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create\nadditional accommodation . Now, looking at the current situation in United States, we are not in\ndeflation . When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010 , or at least a modest risk in late\n2010, we used additional balanc e sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target .\nLikewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non- federal -funds -rate-centered tools to\nachieve additional accommodation for the U .S. economy. So the very critical difference between\nthe Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U .S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation ,\n\nand, clearly , when you’ re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to\nspeak, are demanding additional accommodation. In thi s case , it’s—we are not in deflation, we\nhave an inflation rate that ’s close to our objective . Now, why don’ t we do more ? Well, first I\nwould again reiterate that we are doing a great deal ; policy is extraordinarily accommodative .\nWe—and I won’ t go thro ugh the list again, but you know all the things that we have done to try\nto provide support to the economy . I guess the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a\nhigher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction —a slightly increased pace\nof reduction in the unem ployment rate ? The view of the Committee is that that would be very\nreckless . We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low\nand stable inflation , which has proved extremely valuable in that we ’ve been be able to take\nstrong accommodative actions in the last four or five years to support the economy without\nleading to a n unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation. To ri sk that\nasset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would\nbe, I think, an unwise thing to do.\nKRISTINA PETERSON. Thank you. Given your warnings to lawmakers about the\nlooming fiscal cliff, do you think the Fed has to take into account when Congress chooses to take\naction ? If they waited ’ til January , say, would you feel obligated to take into the —the potential\neconomic blow into account?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think we ’ll have to take fiscal policy into account to\nsome extent, but I think it ’s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal\nauthorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there ’s, I think, absolutely no chance that the\nFederal Reserve could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy .\nSo I—as I have said many times before, it ’s imperative for Congress to give us a fiscal policy\n\nthat achieves two principal objectives . The first is, of course, to achieve fiscal sustainability ove r\nthe longer term ; that is critical, and that ’s something that needs to be addressed. At the same\ntime, I think that can be done in a way that doesn’ t endanger the short -term rec overy of the\neconomy . And I am concern ed that if all the tax increases and spending cuts that are associated\nwith the current law and which would take place —absent any cong ressional action —were to\noccur o n January 1st, that that would be a significant risk to the recovery . So I’m looking and\nhoping that Congress will take actions that will address both sides of that —both requirements of\na good fiscal policy.\nJOSH ZUMBRUN. Mr. Chairman , Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News . In today ’s\nstatement you said , after coming quarters, you expect the econom y “to pick up gradually .” Yet\nin the forecast that we got today, we see the forecast for 2013 and 2014, the growth forecast , is\ndowngraded. What caused you to downgrade your forecast for 2013 and 2014 when you see a\npickup after the coming quarters?\nCHAI RMAN BERNANKE . Well , again, these are the vi ews of the participants, the\n17 participants . So the basic feature that is described in our statement , which is that growth\nseems likely to pick up over time , is still obviously in our projections . The 2013 numbers are\nstronger than the 2012 numbers , and the 2014 numbers are stronger than the 2013 numbers . And\nthe reason for that expected pickup over time is , first , a very accommodative monetary policy ,\nwhich continues to provide support for the recovery . But in addition, some of the headwinds that\nhave been affecting our recovery —such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit\ntightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over time and will allow the\neconomy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer -run full employment level .\n\nThe reason —I don’ t know precisely why there ’s been a slight downgrade in years further out,\nbut I suspect that the fiscal issues may be part of that.\nZACH GOLDFARB . Mr. Chairman, you’ ve made th e inflation t arget sound a little bit\nmore like an inflation ceiling , and you suggested that a b reaching of that ceiling or target would\nhurt the Fed ’s credibility . Can you explain a little bit more about why you think going 50 basis\npoints or a full perc entage point above the 2 percent target would hurt the Fed’ s credibility , and\nwhat that would do on the unemployment side if you were to do that?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . So it ’s not a ceiling, it’ s a symmetric objective , and we\nattempt to bring inflation close to 2 percent . And in particular, if inflation were to jump for\nwhatever reason —and we don’ t have, obviously don’ t have perfect control of inflation—we ’ll\ntry to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to\nunemployment . The risk of higher inflation— you say 2½ percent ; well, 2 ½ percent expected\nchange might involve a distribution of outcome s, some of which might be much higher than\n2½ percent . And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well above 2 percent for a\nprotracted period , that the credibility and the well- anchored inflation expectations , which are\nsuch a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded , in which case we would in\nfact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodat ive monetary policy to achieve our\nemployment goals . I would cite to you, just as an example, if you look at Vice Chair Yellen ’s\npaper, which she gave— or speech , which she gave a couple of weeks ago, where she described a\nnumber of ways o f looking at the late 2014 guidance . She showed there some so -called optimal\npolicy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models , and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes,\nassuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions —still\n\ninvolve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent . So there is no presumption even in our\neconometric models that you need inflation well above target in or der to make progress on\nunemployment.\nPETER BARNES . Peter Barnes, Fox News, sir. For those of us who try to make a living\nout of parsing these statements noted that in the section on strains in global financial markets, the\nCommittee said this time around, “S trains in global financial markets continue to pose significant\ndownside risks to the economic outlook.” But in January, the Committee said that the strains\nwere easing . What are we to read into this apparent change? A re strain s tightening now ? And\nwhat is your assessment of the situation in Europe with the debt crisis —are authorities there\nadequately addressing the debt crisis ? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, it’ s just supposed to be a factual description of what ’s\nhappe ning in the environment . In January , the financial markets had calmed considerably ,\nreflecting a number of steps taken in Europe , including , notably , the two large long- term\nrefinancing operations by the European Central Bank, which helped finance Europe ’s banks for\nup to three years . In recent weeks, we ’ve seen more market stress arising from concerns about\nthe fiscal positions of Spain and Italy , and, you know, we ’ve seen more volatility in our own\nmarkets related to that . So we ’re simply taking note of the fact that a portion of the improvement\nthat we saw late last year and early this year in European financial markets and in our own\nfinancial markets has been reversed recently, nothing more intended than that . As you know, I\nhad the opportunity over the weekend to speak with many of my European and other international colleagues because we had the G –20 and the IMF meetings here in Washington,\nand so we had plenty of opportunities to discuss the European situation. I think it ’s true that the\nEuropeans have made substantial progress overall . I include not only the two LTRO operations ,\n\nbut also the Greek debt deal, the work on the fiscal compact, and recently the setting up of a\nlarger financial firewall that could be used to avo id contagion should another country face\nserious financial distress . So progress has been made, but obviously, judging by market\nconditions, there ’s still more work to be done , and we are counting on our European colleagues\nto continue to follow through t heir commitments and to put very strong effort into addressing\nwhat remain significant problems and concerns in Europe.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, two\nquestions . First, to follow up on Steve ’s point about the interest rate forecast earlier: There are\nnow only four FOMC participants who forecast that rates will still be close to zero at the end of 2014. Given that you said the Committee is entirely happy with that language in the statement,\nwhat information can we then take from the forecasts when they change like that ? The second\npoint —sorry —if you were to decide you wanted to do more to support the economy at some\npoint, could you run us through the set of feasible options to do that ? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERN ANKE . Sure . Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with\nJanuary, you’ll see that a few members have pulled in their expected date. But let me just\nreiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process . They represent\nindividual estimates , and , quite admittedly, as many of the participants said around the table, you\nknow, these are uncertain from an individual point of view . And as we discussed the range of\nconsiderations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I ’ve talked about, for example, the so- called Okun’ s law puzzle about whether or not\nunemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out. Given those uncertainties, given the risks like the European situation or the fiscal cliff that we ’ve just\ndiscussed here , that there was a quite reasonable case for maintaining the guidance at late 2014 .\n\nAnd as I said, there was a great deal of comfort among the participants and the Committee\nmembers with maintaining this guidance.\nGREG ROBB . Thank you. Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com . Judging from some of the\nspeeches lately from Fed officials, it looks like too- big-to-fail is —they view this as the next step\nwhere attention should be paid and work should be done . There ’s even a proposal to have\nlegislation to force bank divestitures . Could you talk about your views on these things ? Thank\nyou.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Yes . I believe that too -big-to-fail was an important cause,\nor at least a propagating mechan ism, of the financial crisis . And I believe it ’s absolutely\nincumbent upon us to do all we can to eliminate too- big-to-fail. And what I mean by that is , a\nsituation where a failing firm is bailed out because its collapse would have such adverse\ncircumstance—consequences for the rest of the financial system . So we are working to get rid of\ntoo-big-to-fail, and I think making some progress .\nFirst of all, we are very substantially increasing the supervisory and regulatory oversight\nof large financial institutions ; that includes, for example, the Basel III rules that require higher\ncapital for all banks but particularly for systemically important banks, mor e liquidity\nrequirements , stress tests, a range of tougher supervisory requirements that are—many of them\nare embedded in the rule we put out on 165–166, that section of the Dodd– Frank Act . So the\nfirst thing we ’re going to do is make sure that these larg e institutions are stronger , that it’ s much\nharder for them to fail , and that they are watched much more carefully and more actively by the\nsupervisors .\nThe other part of eliminating too -big-to-fail, though, is that , in that circumstance where a\nlarge co mplex financial firm does come to the brink of failure , that it must be allowed to fail; it\n\nmust be safe to fail. And in that respect, one of the principal tools that we’ve gotten from Dodd–\nFrank is a so -called o rderly l iquidation a uthority, which is the FDIC’s tool, and the Federal\nReserve is working closely with the FDIC there . The idea is to apply the same kind of bank\nresolution tools that the FDIC has used for many years on domestic banks to large complex financial firms .\nNow, obviously, the comple xity and the international aspects of these firms make that a\nmuch more challenging task, but I think we ’re making progress there . We have put out rules\nabout so- called living wills, which will require large financial firms to essentially plan out how\nthey would be disassembled . And we ’ve continued to talk with international colleagues about\nhow we would cooperate if a multinational firm had to be put into receivership. And , indeed,\npart of the reason that there ’s been some downgrade or potential downgra de for some U.S.\nfinancial institutions is the judgment of the ratings agencies that the so -called implicit\ngovernment support that these institutions have is less than in the past . And so, I think,\nultimately , what we’ ll need to have is a situation where large firms are both making judgments\nabout their size and complexity based only on the economic benefits and costs and not on too-big-to-fail considerations, and that if there is failure, that it can be done and achieved without\nhighly adverse consequenc es for the financial system and the economy . And that ’s our\nobjective , and that ’s the way , I think, to end too- big-to-fail.\nCATHERINE HOLLANDER . You ’ve been working hard to improve communications\nwith both markets and the general public . What ’s your assessment of how both is done?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think that ’s part of your job to say . I think we ’re\nmaking progress . I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is —\nI thought that was important . And we p ut out a statement that described the overall policy\n\napproach of the Federal Reserve. We ’ve taken a number of steps to improve communication,\nincluding these press conferences, of course. But also, by expanding our projections and by\ncontinued, you know, work doing press —doing ,sorry , doing testimonies and speeches, and most\nrecently as you know, I did some classes —I taught some classes at a local university .\nSo we ’re doing our best both—to achieve, really, two objectives . One is to help make the\nFed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’ t\nunderstand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy . And to be good\nvoters and good citizens, they need to understand, you know, something about what the Fed\ndoes. And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know,\nwhat our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans . I think the evidence on the latter point is that there is a better\nunderstanding of the Fed ’s policies . And, you know, we ’ve seen, for example, less volatility in\ninterest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do .\nBut I want to emphasize that this is an ongoing task, it ’s a work in progress , and we ’re\ngoing to continue to look for ways to make ourselves better understand— more understandable\nand more transparent to the public.\nGREG IP . Greg Ip of the Economist . First, assume that you are not c onstrained by the\nzero nominal bound right now . What would the federal funds rate be , even if it were a negative\nnumber ? And do you believe that you are at an equivalent degree of monetary accommodation\ntoday using your unconventional tools ? And also, a quick supplemental —could you put some\nnumbers on what —on the meaning of “ exceptionally low ” federal funds rate ? For example,\nwould a 1 percent federal funds rate qualify as “ exceptionally low ” at the end of 2014?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the exact reading for the federal funds rate today, in\nthe absence of the zero lower bound, would depend a lot on which particular rule, what particular\nmodel that you use . I don ’t want to cite a particular number, but it probably would be negative .\nAnd in that respect, we are trying to compensate for that by the use of nonstandard tools ,\nincluding, as you know, almost a $3 trillion balance sheet .\nWe see monetary policy as being approximately in the right place at this point, based on\nthe analysis that we’ ve been doing in —of the economy and the outlook. That doesn’ t mean we\nmight not take further action ; we are certainly prepared to take further action . But for the time\nbeing, it appears that we are more or less in the right place.\nGREG I P. “Exceptionally low ”?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . “Exceptionally low ”; you know, one of the reasons that\nlanguage in the statement is sometimes a little vaguer than you would like is because we are trying to get a consensus among 17 or at least 10 people, and different members or participants in the FOMC might have somewhat different views of what “ exceptionally low ” means .\nPersonally, I think it means something close to where we are —where we are now.\nDONNA BORAK. Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker . To follow up on the\ntoo-big-to-fail question, there has been acute discussion in recent months about calling for\nbreaking up the banks even louder than before, even including some Fed officials . And you just\ntalked about the need to eliminate too- big-to-fail. Of course, Dodd–Frank —that ’s the intent of\nit. My question is twofold: Do you agree ? And is there an argument to be made for breaking up\nthe banks ? And is that something that the Fed should consider when weighing the importance of\nfinancial stability ? And , sort of , to this earlier point that you made is, what in your view is the\n\nlitmus test that will allow us to know that we can achieve ending too -big-to-fail through Dodd–\nFrank?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial\ninstitution is artificially large . And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial\nstability, then I suppose that considering breaking it up would be something that regulators\nshould look at . My own view , though, is th at a more market -responsive way to address this\nproblem is to eliminate the incentive to be too -big-to-fail. That is , to—through tougher\nsupervisory oversight, through higher capital requirements, through greater liquidity requirements, through restrictio ns on interconnectedness , et cetera, take away the benefits or\nforce firms to internalize the costs of being large and complex . And on the other side, as I was\nsaying earlier, if we can safely unwind a failing firm, then we no longer have too- big-to-fail,\nobviously, and so I think that ’s a very, very important objective . The test would be that the\nfinancial markets that lend to large firms base their bond spreads and what they ’re willing to pay\nfor the stock of those firms solely on the risk- taking and on the business model of those firms\nand not on the fact that there ’s some anticipation of a government bailout . And so I think market\nindicators will help us see our progress towards ending too- big-to-fail.\nSTEVE BECKNER . Steve Beckner of Market News Inte rnational . Mr. Chairman, good\nto see you . There’ s been some concern in markets about what will happen to bond yields at the\nexpiration of Operation Twist on June 30th and some speculation on what the Fed might do—might need to do to keep downward pressure on yields . Is that a concern that you share? A nd do\nyou and your colleagues feel the need not to disappoint these kinds of market expectations?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is\nto achieve our object ives of maximum employment and price stability , it’s not to disappoint or\n\nnot disappoint investors . So we will take actions based on those economic objectives and not try\nto achieve certain market outcomes .\nThere’ s some disagreement, I think, about exac tly how balance sheet actions by the\nFederal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices . The view that we have generally\ntaken at the Fed , in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’ s the\nquantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases —the flow of\nnew purchases —which is the primary determinant of interest rates . And if that theory is correct,\nthen at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minim al effects\non interest rates at that time . And that , in fact , has been our —generally our experience in\nprevious episodes where we have launched a program and then allowed it to come to a natural\nend.\nOf course, we ’ll continue to monitor the situation , and if we believe that financial\nconditions for whatever reason are inconsistent with our macroeconomic objectives, then we will act to fix that. But , again, our expectation is that , at whatever point that the purchases end, that\nfinancial markets being qu ite forward looking will have anticipated that, and that the effects\nought to be moderate.\nAKIO FUJII . Thank you, Chairman. I am Akio Fujii from Nikkei newspaper . My\nquestion is follow -up for your comment about Japan and U.S . Now, are you confident U.S.\neconomy would avoid long -term stagnation like we had in Japan, or so- called Japanization ? And\nif it’s the case, only policy response make a difference of Japan and U.S., or are there any other\nfactor make difference?\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE . The last part again —are there measures?\n\nAKIO FUJII . Yes, policy response is the only reason make a difference U.S. and Japan\nor are there any other factor make a difference of U.S. and Japan situation?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think the —I would draw two distinctions between\nthe U.S. and Japan, or the Japanese experience . The first is that, as I mentioned earlier —and I\nthink this is very important —is that we acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation.\nNow, of course , Japan had a much bigger bubble and a much bigger shock when the bubble\ncollapsed , and so these differences may be certainly understandable . But, again, we did avoid\ndeflation . The other thing which I think we have done reasonably well here in the United States\nwas that we moved fairly quickly to make sure that our banks were recapitalized and were\nrecognizing their bad assets . And I think the stress tests that we conducted last month are good\nevidence that the U.S. banking system is considerably stronger and, indeed , much more resilient\nthan it was a couple of years ago .\nSo those two things are positives and would tend to suggest that we will avoid some of\nthe problems that Japan has faced . That being said, I think it ’s always better to be humble and\njust to, you know , avoid being too confident . And we need to continue to maintain a strong\nmonetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns\nto a more normal situation.\nSCOTT SPOERRY . Scott Spoerry with CNNMoney, sir . I wante d to ask you about the\nlabor force participation rate . It’s at the lowest level since the early ’ 80s. Can you talk about\nwhy people are dropping out of the job market, whether it ’s a permanent structural problem , and\nwhat convinces you that things may ch ange? If I could just a pop a second question to follow up\non Steve and the bonds —your colleague Sheila Bair wrote this week that her —about her concern\n\nover being in a bond bubble . She said you should declare victory, and you should do something\nabout puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control . Can you respond to that too?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . On declaring victory, I think it ’s a little premature to\ndeclare victory . I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy . As\nfor the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons ; they include monetary policy , of\ncourse , but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations , and safe -haven\ndemands for U.S. T reasuries . So, of course , interest rates will rise at some point. We hope that\nthey do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening .\nAnd I think it ’s important for holders of long -term securities to manage their risks and pay\nattention to that . But all that being said, I think , again , that there are both good reasons to\ncontinue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low . The f irst part of your\nquestion was —\nSCOTT SPOERRY. About the —\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Oh, participatio n, labor participation, yes . Actually , we had\na very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue , trying to assess\nhow much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical , and so on. There is ,\nin fact , a downw ard trend in labor participation in the United States . It comes from , first , the fact\nthat we ’re no longer getting increased participation from women; f emale participation has\nleveled out . And , secondly , because, as the society ages , and also for other reasons, male\nparticipation has been declining over time . So there is a downward trend that we have to take\ninto account .\nThe participants at the meeting, at least some of them , suggested, though, that a good bit\nof the decline in participation that we ’ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical\n\nfactors . Much of it is young people , for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force\nindefinitely , but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else\nrather than working . So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall\nas quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens,\nmany of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k, which I think\nwould be a good thing . But we ’ll just have to see . But I do think— I think I would agree with\nthe argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors a nd should reverse when the economy gets\nstronger .\nDON LEE . Don Lee f rom the L.A. Times . Can you give us your assessment of the\nimpact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward? And related to that, I think you sai d last month that some of the recent job gains reflected a catch -up\nfrom outsize cuts right after the recession . I mean, given those two things, what kind of job\ngrowth can we expect?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be\nto make real -time assessments of the state of the economy . The weather has probably affected a\nnumber of things . It probably brought forward some of the hiring so that it made perhaps\nJanuary and February artificially strong and March perhaps artificially a little bit weak . It\nprobably affected construction, manufacturing . There’ s a number of things that were probably\naffected to some extent by the unusually warm weather that we had this winter , and we ’re doing\nour best to try to adjust for that . We ’re also looking at some of the seasonality issues that have\narisen because of the unusually large recession in 2008 and 2009. So , again, that makes the data\nharder to interpret .\n\nI advance d the hypothesis that the increase in employment we ’ve seen in the last five, six\nmonths might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a\none-time catch -up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009. That ’s only a hypothesis .\nWe’ll have to see going forward . If it’s correct , then job gains will be somewhat less than the\n250,000 a month that we ’ve been seeing recently . But we don’ t know yet , we don’ t know yet .\nAnd I wouldn’ t draw too much conclusion from the March report . I think, again , because of\nweather and ot her factors, we really can ’t take a conclusive result from that. So, we ’ll continue\nto be watching the labor market . That ’s a very important consideration. If unemployment looks\nlike it’ s no longer making progress, that ’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy\noptions.\nDON LEE . What kind of job growth, on average , is consistent with the unemployment\nprojections that you ’ve made?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, we need something —estimates differ . We need\nfewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past —I suppose more\nlike 100,000 a month for stability . I don’ t have an exact answer, but broadly speaking, 150–\n200,000 jobs or so. But that ’s a very rough estimate, and , of course, individual participants ma y\nhave different views .\nAgain, that ’s not a forecast, I ’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower\nimprovement in unemployment . But the possibility , of course , exists that this recovery will\ngenerate a virtuous circle with greater hiring, which in t urn generates more consumer spending ,\nand greater hiring , and so on. That remains to be seen , and , of course , which way that goes is\ngoing to be a very important determinant of our response.\n\nPETER COOK . Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television. Thank you for\nthe time . First up, sir, on the projections —in your bid for transparency , for more openness here\nat the Fed, would you consider , in the future, you and your colleagues actually attaching your\nname to the projections here so that , again, markets, folks out in the —watching your actions get\na better sense of exactly what you ’re thinking in the future, what your colleagues are thinking ?\nAnd separately , sir, as you consider where you are at this moment, all you ’ve been through with\nthe financial crisis , the recovery, what is it right now that most frustrates you about this recovery,\nthat still confounds you most about this recovery, that confuses you most?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, those things are not all the same . On the former, our\nsubcommittee , headed by Vice Chair Yellen, is looking at the SEP for ways to improve\ntransparency, and we ’re looking at everything . So, your particular suggestion is on the table , as\nare other ways to try to make this more useful . And, again, it ’s a wor k in progress , as I said\nbefore .\nThe most frustrating aspect, I guess, of the recovery has been that it ’s—has been that it ’s\nbeen quite slow . And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the\nexpansion, and the unemployment rate is still over 8 percent . So we ’re looking and hoping that\nas the headwinds lift, as financial stresses ease, as housing improves , that we ’ll begin to get more\nrapid improvement in the economy and in the labor market . But it has been a very long slog, an d\nthat, I think, would be the single most concerning thing . From a policy perspective, there are\nmany issues , like the fiscal issues , for example. But within the province of the Federal Reserve,\nI think it would be the pace of improvement in the labor market.\nThank you."
