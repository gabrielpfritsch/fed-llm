  "text": "CHAIRMAN POWELL. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for being here . I know\nthat a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am\nhappy to do that in a few minutes. But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain -English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the\nFederal Rese rve are trying to do, and why.\nThe main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well. Most people who want to\nfind jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low. Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis. For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions. In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help s ustain an\nenvironment in which American households and businesses can thrive. Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point.\nMy colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is\nhappening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting. We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways. History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes. We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why. To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.\n\nAs Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to\nsupport a strong and resilient economy. And one practical step in doing so is to have a press\nconference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings. And we’re going to do that beginning in January. That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions. I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes. This change is only about improving communications. My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule.\nNow, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic\nprojections, and our policy decision. Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending. Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable. Several factors support this assessment: Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting. The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020. Compared with the\nprojections made in March, this median growth path is little changed.\nIn the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months,\nwell above th e pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce.\nThe unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been\nroughly unchanged since late 2013. That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our\n\npopulation is putting downward pressure on the participation rate. And we expect the job market\nto remain strong. As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth\nquarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its lon ger-run normal rate. This median path is just a bit lower than that from\nMarch.\nAfter many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation has\nrecently moved close to that level. Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the pr ice\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April. The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period. As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation. The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory. We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis. As we note in our Statement of\nLonger -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation\nwere running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective. Of course, many factors affect inflation —some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be\nabove or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely pu sh inflation\nsomewhat above 2 percent in coming months. But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years. The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020. Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.\n\nAs I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy\naccommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point,\nbringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent. We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting\nthat policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected. None of these changes\nsignals a change in our policy views. F or example, we removed the language stating that “the\nfederal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent.\nAs we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate. As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long -run level. Therefore,\nwe thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement.\nWe continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will\nbest promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. We are aware that raising rates too slowly might\nraise t he risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to\nan unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion. Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the econom y could weaken , and\ninflation could continue to run persistently below our objective.\nThe Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate. The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of\n\n2020. By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level.\nThese projections are very similar to those made in March. Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections.\nI’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters. First, our program for reducing our\nbalance sheet, which began in Octobe r, is proceeding smoothly. Barring a material and\nunexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink. As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our prim ary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.\nAnd, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small\ntechnical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy. To keep the federal funds rate in the targe t range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate.\nUp until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short- term\ninterest rates have risen more generally. So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the\ntarget range. This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally. Thanks for listening, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.\nJIM TANKERSLEY. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Tankersley, New York Times . I have a\nquestion about inflation and a question about growth. On inflation, I’m curious if there’ s\nanything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come. And , on growth, you m entioned fiscal\n\npolicy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a li ttle bit further for us\nand say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So since—I wouldn’ t say anything has h appened since\nMarch to really change the way I ’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee ’s thinking\nabout inflation. We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.\nAnd part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation —down. Part of it is just that continued tightening in the\nlabor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up. So we continue to think, and the Committee continu es to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I\nmentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet.\nYou also asked about fiscal policy, and there’ s a range of views on the Committee and , I\nthink more broadly, a range of views among economists generally. But I can say that the Committee members —Committee participants —generally believe that the fiscal changes —and\nthat includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years. And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side? So it is— it makes\nsense that if you lower corporate tax rates an d allow faster expensing of investment, you will\nencourage greater investment. That should drive productivity. That should increase potential output. So that really ought to happen as well. I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain. There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain. So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal . So the Fed is about\nfour interest rate increases , using the projections released today, away from what might be\nconsidered a neutral fed funds rate. And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do\nonce you get to neutral. Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’ s\nokay to stop raising rates? And under what conditions would you want to keep going?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL . So for many, many years, we’ ve been far from maximum\nemployment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been —has been\nclear. As the economy has strengthened and as we’ ve gradually raised interest rates, the question\ncomes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative? And how will you know? How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral? Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it. So we know that we’ re\ngetting closer to that neutra l level. We don’ t have an exact sense of how that will be. So the\nCommittee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise. And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy? And, you know, I—you asked, how will we kno w? So\nI think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market. We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment. But also, what is the neutral rate of interest ? What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down? So I think we—\nwe’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move\nforward.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. 2.1 percent above target for\ntwo and a half years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed\n\nhere, be it price- level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2. In\ndeciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, the—our target for —our medium- term objective\nfor inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation. We feel that that target has served the econom y well,\nand I ’m strongly committed to it. The Committee is strongly committed to it. The sort of\nbarriers to making a material change to that would be —would be very high because, again, we\nthink it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked.\nYou asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing. You know, there are some\nideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower , we’ re near the zero lower\nbound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’ re going to be down\nat the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation\nobjective. So the idea is to have kind of a makeup. If you—if you ’re below target for a while,\nyou have a—you have a time of being above target. And the idea is to enhance the credibility of\nthat 2 percent —that 2 percent target. This is an idea that ’s been written about for many years.\nIt’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously. I imagine we will be having\ndiscussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now.\nSAM FLEMING. Well, thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .\nOver the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7. In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and retaliatory action from major\nU.S. trading partners. How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy? And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions? Is there something that’s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies? Thanks.\n\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I ought to star t by saying that, you know, Congress has\nassigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices , we have\na role in financial stability that we share with other agencies. Congress has very specifically\ngiven authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn’ t comment on any particular\nspecific trade actions. I will say that we, of course, have—we have broad contacts in —among\nbusiness leaders around the country. And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that. And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting. And they do\ncome back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it’ s fair to\nsay, and also that you’re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people. So right now we don’ t see that in the numbers at all. The\neconomy is very strong. The labor market is strong. Growth is strong. We really don’ t see it in\nthe numbers. It’s just not there. But—so I w ould put it down as more of a risk.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, you said there’ s a difference\nof opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there ’s not a whole lot of difference. It ’s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending\nupon how you count it. Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee—including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long -run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher? Do you believe in\nthat?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, first of all, that’ s a—that ’s a reasonable range, I\nthink, of—it’s not that we’ re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about\npotential gr owth. And there’s so much uncertainty around this. You know, we don’t—the thing\nabout fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’ t have\n\nbig data, in a way. You have very small data. You’ve got only a few instances here, so you have\na lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be. They could be large. We hope they’ re large.\nBut I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’ re just going to\nhave to see.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . How would you forecast it though?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I think we ’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and\nwe’re putting every —different participants are putting differ ent estimates in and we’ re going to\nbe waiting and seeing.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. You said earlier that it’ s still a little too\nearly to declare victory on inflation. I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target as\nsymmetric ? Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it\nwould be rising above—whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long? And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain —how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not\noverrunning?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, what we ’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run\nPrinciples and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation\nwere to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent. And that’s what we mean by symmetric. We ’re looking at it equally on either side and it’ s a matter of\npersistent overruns. We know that inflation is going to bounce around. For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there ’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above\n\n2 percent because of oil prices. Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge\nthat, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target. We do understand, though, that we don’ t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that\ninflation will be above or below. And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press. At this meeting, you\nhiked your —the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you\ntook out a sentence that you’d been using for years about how long rates might stay low. But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views. But shouldn’ t we see from this\ncombination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing\nto make progress. The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years. The economy is in a very different place. We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis. It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower. So reall y what you —the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great\nshape. Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’ s what\nyou’re seeing. For many years, as I mentioned —many years —we had inter est rates held low to\nsupport economic activity. And it’ s been clear that as we’ve gotten closer to our statutory goals,\nwe should normalize policy, and that’ s really what we’ve been consistently doing for some years\nnow.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Chair Powell. Heather Long from the Washington Post . Can\nyou give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages? Are we finally going to see that\n\nwage growth pickup this year? I know you’ re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that\ngoing to translate through to wage growth?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, wages have been gradually moving up. Earlier in\nthe recovery, they were —there are many different wage measures, of course, but —so just—but\njust to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up\ninto between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger. I think it’ s fair\nto say that some of us— and I certain ly would have expected wages to react more to the very\nsignificant reduction in unemploym ent that we ’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to\n3.8 percent. Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ ve talked\nabout at the Committee and elsewhere. But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages —that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about\nlabor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages— but where is the wage\nreaction? So it ’s a bit of a puzzle. I wouldn’ t say it’s a mystery, but it’ s a bit of a puzzle.\nAnd, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment. And one of the\nthings is —you will see —pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people\nwho want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs. You will see wages go up. You’ ll\nsee people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work. They benefit from that. Society benefits from that. So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked. Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability,\nwhich is why we ’re gradually raising rates.\nDON LEE. Just a follow-up on—Don Lee from the L.A. Times . On both inflation and\nunemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher.\n\nAnd how much is the Fed willing to accept that’s an overshoot for both of those before it affects\npolicy?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You ment ioned that unemployment moved down and inflation\nmoved up by truly small amounts. If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March. And you asked, you\nknow—I mean, I think we ta ke a longer -run view that we’re shooting for— we’re aiming for —\n2 percent inflation —inflation around 2 percent. We know that it’ll be above or below. We’ re\nnot going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent. We won ’t\noverreact t o it being over 2 percent. And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move\ninflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves —if it moves away from the target\npersistently, as I mentioned.\nIn terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one\nreally knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time. And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older. Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates. We don’t know this with precision. So we have to be learning as we go. We’ve got to be looking at data and informed by what’s coming in. And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ ve learned —as\nunemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’ t really reacted. So I can ’t give you a precis e\nnumber, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data. And this uncertainty is why —the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we ’ve been gradually raising\nrates. We’re not waiting for inflation to show up. We’re go ing ahead and moving gradually and\n\ntrying to navigate between two risks, really. One would be moving too quickly—inflation never\ngets back to target if we do that. And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we\nhave too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly. And that can also have bad outcomes.\nCHRISTOPHER CONDON. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr. Chairman, I have a\ncouple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves. And you mentioned, of course, that —that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20 basis points, and that’ s a result , as\nyou said , of the upward drift of the effect ive fed funds rate in that target range. Do you think that\nthat’s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in\nthe future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range? And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what’ s causing that? Is it purely technical,\nperhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Thanks. So I would say that—remember the important thing is\nthat we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range. That ’s the whole, the whole idea.\nIOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen. And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate. We don’ t expect\nto have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that. If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again. Again, don’t expect it to happen. You asked why. And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don ’t know with any\nprecision. Really, no one does. It’s— you can ’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and\nnot the other. You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up\n\nfederal funds rate toward s IOER. We don’t know that that’s the only effect and, you know,\nwe’re just going to have to be watching and learning. And, frankly, we don’t have to know\ntoday. What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’ s what\nthis minor technical adjustment accomplishes.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. So with the numbers\nthat we ’re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing. Are\nwe seeing a— with the fiscal policy —a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower\nnatural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the\nnatural rate of unemployment is lower? So I think we do believe it has moved down\nsignificantly over a long period of time. We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot. It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that. So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis , lower. As th e economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that. But, you\nknow, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which a re—which\nare quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data.\nYou asked about inflation. You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent\ninflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed , really control. And we have to be\nstrongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that. I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation. And\n\nso we ’ve been pushing back up. Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the\nopposite. Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down. It’ s really\nimportant that inflation not fall below 2 percent , that inflation expectations remain well anchore d\nat 2 percent —very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that\nyou’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ ll\nspend more time there and we won ’t be able to do the job that we’ re assigned to do for our\ncitizens.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television. You guys moved the\nmedian unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer- run at\n4.5 percent today. But you’ re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate\nbeyond your longer-run value. How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to\nthat 4.5 percent rate?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. I would just —would—I would just emphasize, emphasize\nthat—a couple things. First, we’ re learning about the real location of the natural rate of\nunemployment as we go. So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012. So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we ’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up. If\nyou—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’ re still seeing inflation\nvery close to target. So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these\nlevels, even if unemployment does remain low. So that’s—that ’s what —so it’ s important to\nknow that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts. And so each person who’ s submitting them is submitting accommodate —you\nknow, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment. And their\n\nassessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent.\nSo if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. If I could just follow up really quickly. Then why, I guess, would\nthe longer- run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, it may be. It may be. We may find that out. You know,\nthe best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that. Although, you know, there’ s a range\nof views, you know. Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible. We have to be, you know— we can ’t do—we can ’t be too attached to these\nunobservable variables. You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. I have a couple of regulatory questions. First of all, on the\ncountercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two? And then my second question is, there’ s been a lot of\ntalk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise\ncapital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. That’s the language that we’ve used. And that’ s certainly a\npossibility. I wouldn’ t say that—I wouldn't look at today’ s financial stability landscape and sa y\n\nthat risks are meaningfully above normal. I would say that they’re roughly at normal. You\nhave—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape. They’ re—they’ ve paid\ndown their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs. So households are not really a concern. And banks are highly capitalized, so that’ s not really a concern. We see—there’s some concern\nwith asset prices in a couple of pockets. But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see,\ngenerally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate. Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years? Yeah, it could.\nYou also asked about marijuana businesses. So this is a very difficult area because we\nhave state law —many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn ’t. So it\nputs, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation. I think it would be great if that could be clarified. We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position. And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really —we just would love to see it clarified, I think.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker . So since you—since even\nbefore you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee , you\nlaid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that ’s actually been pretty consistent . So there was\nthe guidance on boards of governors, there was the—some changes to the stress tests, and —not\nchanges to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling —and now, more recently, the\nchanges to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer. Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being? Or what el se can we\nexpect from the Fed?\n\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. It ’s actually a pretty full docket right now. You mentioned a\nnumber of the things , but I would—I would point out—we ’re having, I guess, a public Board\nmeeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision. We’ve also got quite a lot of\nwork to promulgate rules to—after S. 2155 that Senator Crapo’ s bill passed —we’ ve got a lot of\nwork to do under that. We’ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level.\nSo what am I missing? There’s —there —oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be\ndone. So there’s a lot of work to do, I think. You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago. We went to work for 10 years to\nstrengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning. We want to keep all that stuff. We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient. We want to tailor those regulations for institutions. We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions. And so we ’re committed to preserving\nand enhancing that structure. But we—we ’re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring\nregulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that’s a lot of what we’ re\nworking on right now.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. You said at the beginning of your press conference that you\nplan to be more plainspoken. And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see. Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape. If\nyou look at household surveys, confidence is high. Look at businesses, confidence is high. If you ask —if you survey workers about the job market, they’ ll say that it’s a really good\n\nenvironment to find jobs. If you survey businesses, they’ ll say that workers are scarce. So I\nthink overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here. And so what we’ re\ndoing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep\nthe labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent. That ’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so\nfar. We ’re—we ’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly. I think we’ ve been\npatient. I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to. We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’ m really glad we didn ’t. But, at this time, the —\ncontinuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing. If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ ll certainly react to that.\nDAVID HARRISON. Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires. Where do you\nsee the neutral interest rate is right now? Do you think it’s—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures? And how will you know when we’ re getting\nclose to that neutral point? So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the\nCommittee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there. So that’ s the range\nof estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest. And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision. You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy? Yes. I mean ,\nthere’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say. Again, though, they were estimating these things. It’ s one\n\nof these unobserved variables so it’s very hard to—we shouldn’ t try to speak about it with a —\nwith a lot of precision or confidence. But, yes, that should put upward pressur e on it. How will\nwe know? Well, I think you have to look at inflation. You’ve got to look at— you’ve got to look\nat all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at\nwhat ’s happening in the job market. And inflat ion is really important. It ’s worth noting that the\nlast two business cycles didn’ t end with high inflation —they ended with financial instability —so\nthat’s something we need to also keep our eye on.\nVIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse. Have you talked\nduring the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10 years? And could this change in the vocabulary\nmake the market nervous? And have you thought already at some options so to know how you’re going to call it down the road?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes, that is —that is something that we discuss. We look at all\nthe language. As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this\nmeeting. So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes. That’ s\nwhat happens. We really —our approach to policy hasn’t changed. And, you know, as I\nmentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy. As\nthe economy has recovered, we’ ve been gradually raising rates and we will —we will be at a\nplace relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral. And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative. We know that’s coming. We kind of don’ t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming. And I think\nthat the market will understand that. I mean , the real message is that you ’re getting close to the\n\nneutral rate. It ’s a characterization about where policy is. It ’s not a statement , really , that should\nupset the markets. But, you know, we’ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and\ncommunicate about it. So.\nNAOATSU AOYAMA. Thank you very much. Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi\nShimbun, Japan ’s newspaper. Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside\nrisks —downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues? Many people are—in the key allies\nof the United States —are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of\nthe international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment. So —and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the\nglobal economy as well as the U.S. economy. So would you—have you —can I have your views\non that?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I’ m really\ncommitted to staying in our lane on things. We have very important jobs assigned to us by\nCongress and that’ s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability. Trade is explicitly\nassigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us. So we don’ t really —we don’ t really\nseek to play a role in trade policy. We’ re not at that table. Those are—those powers and\ndecisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do. And, you know, I—as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I’ ve just mentioned what those are. There is\n—there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive. And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in th e numbers yet. We really don’ t. We see a very strong economy across a bunch\nof fronts. It hasn’ t reached everyone, let ’s be clear on that. But most people who want a job can\n\nfind one . We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who hav e not felt the\nrecession yet, but, broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.1\nSTEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for\nNPR. About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short- term\nrates are b ringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very\nslowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high? How do you account for\nthe fact that long rates have been so slow to rise? And what does it say about the inflation\noutlook as well?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So let me —let me briefly mention the yield curve. I mean, I —\nthe yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants. And I —you have a range of views. It’ s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.\nIt’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about. I think that that discussion\nis really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate. How do we understand what the neutral rate is? How do we know where it is? And what are the consequences of being above or below it? That ’s really what —when people are\ntalking about the slope of the yield curve, that’ s really what they ’re talk ing about. We know\nwhy—we know why the yield curve is flattening. It’ s because we ’re raising the federal funds\nrate. It makes all the sense in the world tha t the short end would come up.\nI think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates? And there\nare many things that move long rates around. Of course, there’ s an embedded expectation of the\npath of short rates. There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards. And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it. In\n\n1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet\nexperienced the economic recovery .\n\naddition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk -on, risk -\noff. In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries , and you see—you know,\nTreasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot. So—but I think ultimately, you know, what\nwe’re—what we really care about is what ’s the appropriate stance of policy. And there’ s a—\nthere may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’ s why\npeople are paying attention to the yield curve.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.\nCompanies are buyin g back their shares at a record rate. Corporate debt is up. Consumer debt is\nrising. Are we in a credit bubble? Is that something that you’ re worried about?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit\ngrowth , you don’ t see high levels of credit going out. So not so much households. And that\nreally was where the problems were before the financial crisis , was particularly in —among\nhousehold borrowing, particularly around mortgages. With—if you take banks, then, of cours e,\ntheir leverage is significantly lower. Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher. If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’ s really where leverage is at levels that are high\nrelative to history. But defaults are low, inte rest rates are low, you know, so it’s something—\nthat’s something we’re watching very carefully. But, again, I don’ t think we see it as —I think\nthere are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates. Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’ s where —you know, that’ s\nwhere we got into trouble before. And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge. We don’ t really see that now, so we take some\nsolace from that.\n\nMYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance. Chair Powell, you referenced a\nminute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’ t have as much of when rates are\nlow and inflation is low. And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your\nmove to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come. And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions? Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing?\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn ’t play any part in my thinking and I’ ll tell you why.\nIf you raise rates too quickly , you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’ s\nexactly what you don’t want to do. So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction. If you’ re—if you ’re worried about going back to the lower\nbound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate —that ’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower\nbound. I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced. And so I think it’s more just—we ’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we—\nhow do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?\nMARK HAMRICK. Mark Hamr ick with Bankrate. You talked earlier about wage\ngrowth and your basic message to workers. How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that.\nIf companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need\n\nto do once they’ve—once they’ ve made profits and have cash to distribute. They can distribute\nit to their shareholders, they can buy—either through dividends or through buybacks. They can\npay their workers. You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions. The part that we focus on is maximum employment. That’s our mandate. So we view maximum\nemployment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it ’s not so much that it\nwill cause the economy to overheat. And so I think we’ ve been committed to that. I think we\ntake that obligation very seriously. And, you know, over time, when— when labor markets are\nstrong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages. But, again, we don’ t really have\nthe tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing."
