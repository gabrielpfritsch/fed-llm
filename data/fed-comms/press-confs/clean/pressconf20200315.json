  "text": "March 15 , 2020\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good evening, everyone. Today the Federal Reserve took a number\nof actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote\nthe flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus. The virus is having a\nprofound effect on people acr oss the United States and around the world. On behalf of my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who ’ve been harmed.\nFamilies, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking\nsteps to protect peopl e’s health. These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak,\nwill nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term. While the\nprimary response to this challenge will come from our health -care providers and poli cy experts,\neconomic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the\neconomy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed.\nThe Federal Reserve ’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote\nmaxi mum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities\nto promote the stability of the financial system. Today we reduced the target range for our policy\ninterest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain\nthe rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on\ntrack to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. In addition, we took other\nactions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nBefore describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently\nview the economic outlook. The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.\nThe unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half -century lows\nfor almost two years. Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to\n\nprovide jobs for new entrants into the labor market. Participation in the labor force by people in\ntheir prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade. And wages have\nbeen rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs. Overall economic activity has been expanding at\na moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade d evelopments have been weighing\non some sectors. U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well\npositioned to provide credit to households and businesses.\nAgainst this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges. Like\nothers, we expect that the illness and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will\nhave a significant effect on economic activity in the near term. Those in travel, tourism, and\nhospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business. In addition, the effects of the\noutbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing\ndifficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains. The weakness abroad will also\nweigh on our exports for a time. Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress\nbecause of the large drop in global oil prices. Inflation, which has continued to run below our\nsymme tric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak.\nFinancial conditions have also tightened markedly. The cost of credit has risen for all but\nthe strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down s harply. Moreover, the\nrapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to\nassess the path ahead. In the past week, several important financial markets, including the\nmarket for U.S. Treasury securities, h ave at times shown signs of stress and impaired liquidity.\nThe market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global\nfinancial system. It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by\nwhich many other fin ancial assets are valued. It plays an important role in allowing households\n\nand firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks. When stresses arise in the Treasury\nmarket, they can reverberate through the entire financial system and the economy. To prevent\nthis from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we\nannounced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the\ncoming months.\nSimilar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage -backed securities,\nwhich is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get\na mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage. To improve the functioning of this\nmarket and to ensure the ef fective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy,\nwe will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities over coming\nmonths and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio. While the prima ry\npurpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can\ncontinue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to s upport the flow of\ncredit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price\nstability goals. Of these, I will highlight two. First, we reduced the interest rate on discount\nwindow loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing tha t rate to ¼ percent. The discount window\nplays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we\nencourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from\nhouseholds and businesses. To make th e discount window more effective, we will also offer\ndiscount window loans for periods up to 90 days.\nBecause of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for\nborrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States.\n\nTo guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major\ncentral banks. When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the\npressures in their jurisdictio ns and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home.\nTo address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty,\nwe made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank\nof Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our\ndollar swap lines. In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to\ninstitutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one -week\noperation. These long- standing arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the\nAmerican taxpayer.\nI won’t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating\nreserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the\nFederal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to\nhouseholds and businesses.\nThe actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and,\nindeed, our entire economy weather this difficult period and will foster a more vigor —more\nvigor ous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate. We will continue to\nclosely monitor economic and financial developments a nd their implications for the economic\noutlook. We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum\nemployment and price stability goals.\n\nFinally, let me note that today’s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting\nscheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday. Thank you. I’ll be—I’ll be happy to take a few of\nyour questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. The Chair will now take some questions. Please dial “ star 1 ” on\nyour phone to indicate you want to ask a question. You will be unmuted when you are called on.\n[Extended silence] Okay, CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this —these\nactions to be? Do you— do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided? Secondly,\nthere was talk about additional programs that could come out —for example, a Primary D ealer\nCredit F acility or a T erm A uction F acility. Do you expect those to be announced soon?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, based on our discussions today and many\nconversations with participants, it ’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of\nthe economy, as is always the case with the Fed. But, in general, I’d say that we see the U.S.\neconomy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus. We see that it\nis likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing\nfrom or reducing certain activities —thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things —\nand that ’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time. These are choices that we\nmake to protect ourselves —appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus.\nSo that means th at the second quarter is probably going to be weak —in fact, in the view\nof many, output declining —output lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.\nAfter that, it’ s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last . And that ’s\n\ngoing to depend, of course , on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly\nuncertain, and I would say , in fact, unknowable.\nWe do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a\nnormal level of activity. In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the\nflow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —\nultimately , to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible.\nYou also asked about other facilities. I would point out that we have , of course ,\nresponded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today. And\nwe believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally. And as I\nsaid in my statement, we ’re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thanks. We ’ll go to Marketp lace r adio.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I ’m wondering , are you considering negative interest rates at this point? Is there a\nscenario in which you think that would be appropriate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, a s I’ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee —\nas you know, we did a year -plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications.\nAnd we , really , at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and\nasset pu rchases—asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as\nthe basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound—\nso, really , forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of thos e. You know, we looked\nat negative policy rates during the Global F inancial C risis, we monitored the ir use in other\n\njurisdictions , we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an\nappropriate policy response here in the United States.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’re going to the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I\nguess I wanted to understand, specifically , how the actions you’ ve announced this evening will\nget credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue. And\nalso, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities\nundertake —again, to make sure that firms with large drops in i ncome and revenue don ’t go bust\nover the next few weeks or months?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me tell you how , I think —what our tools can accomplish,\nand—and really what they ’re not designed to accomplish. So what our liquidity operations —and\nI’ll talk specifically about the T reasury and MBS purchases —are designed to do is to assure the\nproper functioning of the T reasury and MBS markets. The Treasury market is one of the most\nimportant, perhaps the most important, market in the world. It’s probably the most l iquid large\nmarket in the world. The MBS market is very important: It’s closely linked to the Treasury\nmarket , and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real\neconom y. So, two very important markets. And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity ,\nand—to the point where we —as you know , last week we offered financing —very large amounts\nof financing. And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and\nreturn to normal function. And we found that that helped, but , nonetheless, we thought we had\nto do more. And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase program s that we\ndid today. And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.\n\nNow, why is that important to —to everyone? These markets are part of the foundation of\nthe global financial system and of the United States financial system. And if they are not\nfunctioning well, then other markets —then that will spread to other markets. And those are the\nmarkets that —that amount to —that —where households and businesses typically get credit. So\nwe know that dysfunctional financial markets —a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have\nvery big negative effects on the economy. We saw that during the financial crisis. This is a very\ndifferent situation , but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong\nmeasures to support —to support proper market function in these important markets.\nNow, you asked about households. It’s true, we don ’t have the tools to reach individuals\nand particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or\nwhose businesses may not —may experience a period of very low activity. We don’ t have those\ntools. We have the tools that we have, and we use them. I think we ’ve used them quite\naggressively for the benefit of the public. But this is a multifaceted problem, a nd it requires\nanswers from different parts of the government and society. I mean , I think th at, by far , the most\nimportant is the response of the health- care workers and health -care policymakers. After that,\nfiscal policy. We ’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming. I think fiscal policy is a\nway to direct relief , really , to particul ar populations and groups. Monetary policy has a role , and\nit really is in , you know —our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when\nthey’re under stress , and that’s—that ’s really part of what we did today. The other role is to\nsuppor t demand through lower interest rates, and we did that.\nYou—you asked about fiscal as well , and I guess I ’ve sort of covered that. We do think\nfiscal response is —is critical , and we ’re happy to see that those measures are being considered ,\nand we —we hope they are effective.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’re going to go to Fox Business.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness Network. In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have\ndeclined . The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year , and that ’s become one of the focuses\nof the FOMC meeting s. Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming , and is this large\ncut meant to get in front of any more inflation? Plus, as a second question, would the Fed\nconsider buying securities outside of T reasuries and mortgage- backed securities? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So, on—on inflation, you know , the—the econom y’s\nperformed so well, really , over the last few years , and right up through January : historically low\nunemployment —50- year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years —almost 11 years of\nexpansion so far , and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent. So we ’ve been concerned that\ninflation not move down further. It’s not at all a question of deflation. It was a question of not\ngetting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.\nSo, with this coronavirus arriving, we judge d that the —the net effects of this will be to —\nto have inflation move down e ven a little bit more. And it’s —it’ s not a question—it’ s not —it’s\nnot an issue of deflation. Again, it ’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.\nWe expect, with uncertainty, that , you know —that it will fall a little bit further , at least , below\nwhere it has been. We are—of course, we don ’t have the legal authority to buy other securities\nother than the ones we already buy , and we ’re not seeking authority to do so. We haven ’t\ndiscussed that at the —at the FOMC , and it’s not —it’s n ot legal authority that we ’re seeking.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’ll go to the Financial Times.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Thank you, Chair Powell. This is Brendan Greeley with the\nFinancial Times. You have talked about the mortgage -backed security purchases and t he\n\nTreasury purchases as a stability —a stability operation. I’m pretty sure that every person on this\ncall has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing. How do we\ndraw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is\nexplicit quantitative easing? Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So w hat—what I can tell you definitive ly is what the purpose of the\nasset purchases was , and I mentioned this in my statement. And it really is to support the\navailability of credit in the economy —households and businesses —and thereby support the\noverall economy. How do they do that? They d o that by supporting proper market functioning\nin the T reasury market and the MBS market. So you see —and I think you ’ll see —as these\npurchases roll forward, you will see the T reasury market and the MBS market returning to\nnormal market function , and that will actually support economic activity. That will be a positive\nfor economic activity.\nIn terms of what it’ s labeled , that ’s of less interest to me. I really think we are very clear\nin our minds what we ’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be —\nwhich would be both better market function and— and—you know, when there ’s better market\nfunction, it will be —you know, policy will be supporting the economy better.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to ask some timing questions\nhere. First, on the —whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase\n“over coming months.” Is there a timetable for that? How long are we talking about —$700\nbillion , obviously , over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year.\nAnd do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?\nAnd the same with the interest rate cut to zero —how long do you think that might last, a nd\n\nwould you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you\ncut it from? Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so —sorry.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike, can you ask your question?\nCHAIR POWELL. What was it again ? W hat was the question again? Just tell me . I\ncan’t read my writing. [Laughter]\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I was asking about timing. How long a period—\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah, okay, great.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. — are we talking about for the QE purchases , and how long do you\nanticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay , sorry. So that ’s the “ in coming months ” language. Let me tell\nyou what we were doing there. So there ’s no monthly cap here. There's no weekly cap. The\nDesk is going to go out , and it ’s going to buy at a strong rate that is —that we think will restore\nmarket function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored. And that language is open\nended , and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that , you know, we ’re not going to be\nbound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that. We ’re going to go in strong\nstarting tomorrow , and we ’re going to buy across the curve , and we ’re going to buy MBS , and\nwe’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these\nimportant markets to normal function. So that —that ’s really what that is.\nAs far as —as the policy rate, what we ’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this\nlevel until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to\nachieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. So, you can see, that ’s the test\nwe’ve written down. And if you—if you look at it, you’ ll see that some things have to happen\n\nbefore we’ d consider —we’d have to become confident of —that the economy has weathered\nthese recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability\ngoals. So that ’s a test we ’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that , you know , we’re going to\nbe watching and willing to be patient , certainly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’re going to go to the Associated Press.\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER. Hi, it’ s Chris Rugaber at AP. In 2008, you had a lot of\ncoordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury —Bernanke doing a lot\nof things with Paulson and so forth. You know, today the White House had its press conference\nat 5:00. Y ou guys are doing something a little separate. Is there —do you think it would be more\nhelpful to market s—perhaps , in the broader economy , to have a more coordinated response? Is\nthat something we might look for in the future?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I would say this. You know, we have differ ent tools. I think\nwe do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with\nthem on things , with clear lines of delineation. For example, the Treasury Department has\nauthority over fiscal policy. That ’s not our job. It’s their job , with other parts of the\nAdministration. It’s just that —like that for us with monetary policy. We have sole\nresponsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an\nindependent, nonpolitical way. So those two things are —one for each of us.\nBut in the middle there, there are areas where we —where we can cooperate. And also,\nthere’ s a long history . You would want the finance ministry and the t reasury [and the central\nbank] to be talking in every major econom y in the world. You would want them to be regularly\nexchanging information—professional relationships not just at the , you know , the Chair -to-\nTreasury -Secretary level, but also through the organization. For example, the New York Fed is\n\nthe Treasury ’s agent—fiscal agent , as you know , so there ’s a lot that goes into debt management\nand the issuance of debt , which happens at the New York Fed. So I think we do, actually —we\nhave professional , good working relationships up and down the chain there , and, you know,\nthat—that seems to me to be working. And there is —there’ s also quite a lot of coordination in\nother respects with —of course , with foreign central banks, but you didn’ t ask about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay , we’re going to go to the Washington P ost. [ Silence]\nWashington Post , are you there?\nHEATHER LONG. Hey, sorry, I ’m here. I think —hi, Chair Powell . Two questions this\nevening. First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus , and are you working from\nhome? If you could shed some li ght on the precautions you’ re taking . And, second, do you\nbelieve the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment , or are you seeking congressional action to\nexpand your tool set?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I feel fine. I feel very well , and so there ’s no reason for me to be\ntested. We are observing —we ’re trying to model good behavior here , so we ’re observing quite a\nlot of teleworking. And also, we’re— you know , we’re not having a lot of big, crowded\nmeetings —we’re not having any big, crowded meeting s. So we ’re trying to observe all of the\nthings that the professionals tell us to do. I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to\nmodel that —that it’ s okay for the people to do so. In fact, it ’s important for them to do so. So I\nwill do that.\nIn terms of our —of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know , I think we do have plenty\nof space to adjust our policy. I mentioned our liquidity tools —you know , we have a lot of power\nin our liquidity tools , and, as I mentioned , we’re prepared to use t hem. In addition, we ’ve got\nplenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies , so I\n\nthink we do have room. We—we have not at all made a decision to request further —further\ntools or authorities from Congress, no. We —we have not made that decision. It is not\nsomething we ’re actively considering right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’ll go to the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York\nTimes. Thanks for taking our questions. I’m just curious —you know, obviously , you held this\nmeeting in lieu of your meeting later this week. Will you still release a Summary of Economic\nProjections ? And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the\neconomy as the coronavirus shapes up?\nCHAIR POWELL. So why no —I guess you ’re asking , why no SEP , and what ’s our\nforecast? So a couple reasons we didn’ t do an SEP. First, we decided on Thursday to move the\nmeeting up by three days to today , and that ’s before the S EPs are generally filed. They hadn’ t\nbeen filled out , and we —frankly , we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these\nannouncements. Second, and, you know , a number of FOMC participants had already reached\nout to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis , and it really is\ndepending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long\nthat goes on. And that is just not something that ’s knowable. So , actually , writing down a\nforecast in that circumstance didn ’t seem to be useful , and, in fact, it could have been more of an\nobstacle to clear communication than a help. I do expect that we’ ll return to the quarterly —\nregular quarterly cycle in June, however.\nIn terms of the forecast, so , as I mentioned, you know , we see the U.S. economy starting\nout strong —from a strong position, different —different as we—as we talk ed through it today .\nPeople have a rang e of perspectives on the way the year is going to go , but I think there ’s a\n\npretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter , with probably out —you know,\noutput declining a bit. After that, it becomes hard to say , you know , what ’ll happen in the third\nand fourth quarters and thereafter , and it’s going to depend, again , on—on the path of the virus.\nSo the thing we do know is that we ’ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit a nd\nthere to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Now we ’ll go to Bloomberg News.\nCRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell . Craig Torres at Bloomberg News. You say the\npath of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus. How importa nt is fiscal\npolicy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short and of high\nhuman consequence or little human consequence? And , second, can you talk a little bit about\nwhat ’s on your dashboard for economic and financial indica tors that you’ re going to be watching\nday to day? I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in\nApril. What are you going to be watching , and what should we be watching?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of fiscal policy, I thi nk in the first instance —and\nyou’re—you’re seeing some of this now —is the thing that fiscal policy and , really , only fiscal\npolicy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers , and we ’ve seen some\nof that. So, that ’s—that’s an imp ortant job for fiscal policy. More broadly, after that , there ’s the\nquestion of —of fiscal —broader fiscal stimulus , and I think that ’ll depend on the path of the\neconomy. I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’ s some —it’s very\nhard to predict. But there could certainly be —there could certainly be , you know , a need for\nthat. And your second question was —what was your second question?\nCRAIG TORRES. Ye s. It was on what indicators you’ re going to be looking at,\nfinancial an d real.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think , in the very near term , we’re going to be looking at , you\nknow , the Treasury market function. We ’re really going to be looking to see that financial\nmarkets are returning to more liquid , more normal functioning. That is an essential part of our\njob. That is —actually , you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to\ndo, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress , so we take that job very seriously. It’s\nprobably the most important thing we ’re doing now is that . So we ’ll be watching that a nd we ’ll\nbe prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address —to—to support market\nfunctioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Those are the\nthings I ’ll be looking at. You know, in terms of economic data, I think it ’s just so early. You\nknow, we ’re really looking —I mean , the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the\nvirus. You know, I think what happens —what happens during the spread of the virus is probably\nnot going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months. It ’s going to be —\nbecause you may have a —you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things\nget better in the third quarter, that p robably won ’t matter so much. We may be able to come\nback from that. If it lasts longer —so that ’s really what I ’ll be looking for , is—is what is going to\nbe the spread of the virus and what ’s the path it’ s going to take and what are the effects on the\neconomy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’ll go to NBC News now.\nDAVID GURA. Hi, Chair Powell. This is David Gura from NBC News . And a lot of\ngood questions here , so I’ll—I’ll turn to one that ’s more philosophical in nature. And you’ ve\ntalked a bit about the —the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower\neconomic activity for a period of time. I’m reckoning with fact that my kid ’s going to be out of\nschool until April 20 at the earliest, s o we ’re feeling this very , very acutely . But I wonder if you\n\ncould just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader\ncontext —how you look at this a nd how anomalous this thing is with which you and your\ncolleagues are going to have to reckon. That ’s my first que stion.\nThe second is , you know , we’ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few\nweeks , and the market —which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to —\nhas reacted negatively to some of that. What do you make of that? G oing back to the question\nthat was asked earlier about the toolbox and—and what ’s left —what’s left in it, r ates are low.\nDoes that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools\ntherein?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess your fi rst question is , how —how do we think about the\ntime—the time for this thing ? You know —and the truth is , we just don’ t know , and, you know ,\nthe experts we talk to will say that they don ’t know , and that it ’s, in fact , unknowable. It’s going\nto depend on a number of things. First, it’ s the measures that we take to , you know , to—with the\nsocial distancing , and the —all the things businesses and school and everyone ’s doing now . And\nthat will depend , to some extent , on how compliant people are. You can see that some countries\nhave had a —have been able to , through aggressive measures and really high compliance —have\nbeen able to bend the curve and—and do that. And whether we succeed or—you know, that ’s\nreally the question. And I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t , you know —I’ll resist the impulse to guess. I\nreally don ’t know what that will be.\nIn terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left,\nplenty of power left in our tools , and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools. That , I\nthink, is —is right now the most important thing that we ’re doing. Our interest rates will\nmatter —cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts , but they ’ll\n\nmatter a lot more when the economy begins to recover. So —but in the forefront now are the\nliquidity tools and—and getting that job done well.\nIn addition, as I mentioned, we —you know , we have room to provide forward guidance,\nto do more asset purchases. I think there —there is room for us to do what we need to do. I—I\nwould just close , though, by saying that, you know , typically , fiscal policy does play a major role\nwhen —when there are downturns. You saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns , and\nthat’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers. Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary\nbasis , and that —that will probably need to be the case here as well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’ll go to Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politic o. Thanks for doing the call. I just\nwanted to ask , do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council? With\nall the stress that’ s showing up in different markets , do you see risks to financial stability rising ?\nDo you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack down on? And are you\nconfident that there aren ’t any nonbanks that are systemically important?\nCHAIR POWELL. FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs. And\nit’s a big group—it’ s got a lot of people. I think it serves a good purpose. But, you know, you\nshould know that we are , of course , in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies ,\nconstantly talking about what ’s going on in markets. There’ s a lot of information and\nconve rsation on an ongoing basis there , I would say. So —and the same is true with our central\nbank contacts around the world. W e’re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks\naround the world, talking about what ’s going on. We’re having group calls, we ’re calling one-\non-one, so there ’s quite a lot of information being exchanged there.\n\nAnd then, your question was , nonbank SIFIs. You know , again, that ’s a judgment for\nthe—that’s a judgment for the FSOC. I—you know , I’m comfortable with the actions th at we’ ve\ntaken , and if—if we do identify , you know, a systemically important nonbank institution , then\nwe wouldn’ t hesitate to designate it, but —although I guess now we ’re working more on\nactivities , but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so —\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay —\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Financial stability risks —are those rising?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m sorry, the question was —\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Are risks to financial stability rising , given all the stress that ’s\nhappening in financial m arkets?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. I would say , you know , that ’s—that’s something that\nhappens when markets are as volatile as they are, w hen you’ re having these big market\nmovements while markets are trying to understand what ’s going on. They ’re trying to reach a\nview on—in high uncertainty , and that ’s why you see lots and lots of volatility. I think there ’s\nmore risk to financial stability in an era like —like that than there is when things are really placid ,\nand, you know, we ’re going home at 4 o’ clock and kind of bored over here. That ’s not the case\nright now. So, financial stability —I would say those —those risks do rise at a time of high\nvolatility, particularly a time where we ’re presenting —presented with a challenge that is —is\nkind of unique , really —it’s not something we ’ve all done before.\nI also want to add, though, that, you know , we’re strongly focused on financial stability.\nWe monitor it carefully. We’ve built a very resilient financial system. The banks are highly\ncapitalized, lots o f liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their\nresilience to stress. So our financial stability focus —our focus on an event like this over the last\n\n10 years will pay dividends , in the sense that you have a much more resilient fi nancial system\nthan you’ ve had before.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’ll go to Market News.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, this is Jean Yung. I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market\nDesk expanded its term repo operations, but the take -up was a bit low. Is that —did y ou have any\ntakeaway from that? Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had\nenvisioned it , or was there something else that you learned from that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw , that liquidity had\nbecome very strained in Treasury and MBS markets , and we decided to offer very large\nquantities of term and overnight repo to address that. That makes it easier to finance the\npurchase of repos —sorry, of Treasuries and MBS. So we did that , and as you pointed out, the\ntake- up was not as high as many had expected , and I did—we did learn something from that. We\nthought that was worth doing , and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather\nthan trying to intermed iate through the dealers.\nAnd so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for\nour portfolio, s o we did that on Friday. We bought —the next day , Friday, we went in and we\nbought across the curve , and we bought, I think, $ 37 billion worth of securities , and then we saw\nwhat happened with that. We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn ’t\nwhat we needed. And that ’s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this\nafternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures , with the broad\nsupport of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity. And I —I think you\ncan see us working through different solutions and—and finding the one that we think really will\nwork and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we ’re going to go to Reuters for the last question.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Two\nthings , if I could. Could you describe any discussions you’ ve had in coordination with the major\nbanks —this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers —how far can\nthey draw it down? How much do you think they can put out —out to customer finance? Did\nyou get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something\nelse? And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of —of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to\ndo some sort of direct lending facilit y?\nCHAIR POWELL. We have given broad general guidance to the banks. We’d like them\nto use their buffers to provide —you know, to provide loans and—and also to work with their\nborrowers . As you can see, we ’re providing a lot of guidance to them across a w ide range, a nd\nthey’re saying they have every intention of doing that. That ’s good to hear. A nd—s o we ’ll see\nhow that works out. There —there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know , we hear the\nbanks saying , that ’s exactly what they ’re going to do, s o that ’s a good thing.\nYou know , we’re—of course , we’ve —we’re—we ha ve nothing to announce on—on\n13(3) powers , but, you know , of course , we—that ’s part of our playbook in —you know, in any\nsituation like this. So, as I said, we’re—we ’re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate\nto—you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy , and, hence, to support the\navailability of credit to households and businesses.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you very much."
