  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon. Before we get to questions, I ’ll summarize\ntoday ’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the C ommittee ’s\ndecision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment about the\nappropriate path of monetary policy .\nAs indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the C ommittee is\nmaintaining a highly accommodative policy . We decided to keep the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and we continue to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to\nwarrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014 . In addition,\nthe C ommittee decided to co ntinue through the end of the year our program of lengthening the\nmaturity of our sec urities holdings rather than completing the program this month as previously\nscheduled . Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining\nmaturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less . The detail s of\nour plans for our securities purchases and sales were described in an accompanying statement\nreleased today and can be found on the continuation of the maturity extension p rogram should put downward pressure on longer -term\ninterest rates and make broader financial condit ions more accommodative than they would\notherwise be, thereby supporting economic recovery.\nIn conjunction with today ’s meeting, FOMC participants —the 7 Board members and the\n12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy\nassessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the longer run. These projections are important\n\ninputs to the C ommittee ’s deliberations . Incoming information suggests that the economy\ncontinues to expand at a moderate pace in the face of headwinds generated by the situation in\nEurope, a still -depressed housing market, tight credit for some borrowers, and fiscal restraint at\nthe federal, state, and local levels . Business and household spending are increasing at rates\nconsistent with moderate econom ic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a\nsomewhat slower pace than earlier this year . Employment gains have been smaller in recent\nmonths , and the unemployment rate , at 8.2 percent , remains elevated . In light of these\ndevelopments, C ommittee participants have generally marked down their projections for\neconomic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming\nquarters and then picking up gradually .\nBased on their projections for economic growth, FO MC participants foresee slower\nprogress in reducing unemployment than they did in April . Committee participants ’ projections\nfor the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 perce nt to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 , levels that would\nremain above participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of unemployment . In\naddition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment . In\nparticular, participants noted that strains in global financial markets, associated principally with the situation in Europe, continue to pose significant risks to the re covery and to further\nimprovement in labor market conditions .\nMeanwhile, inflation has declined recently, primarily reflecting lower prices of crude oil\nand gasoline . Longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable, and the C ommittee\nanticipates that inflation over the medium run will run at or below the 2 percent rate that it judges\n\nmost consistent with its statutory mandate for maximum employment and price stability . More\nspecifically, participants ’ projections of inflation have a central tend ency of 1.2 to 1.7 percent for\n2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014. The economic projections submitted by FOMC\nparticipants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary\npolicy . As you can see from the chart, C ommittee participants have a range of views about when\nthe initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be warranted .\nAfter a thorough discussion of those views , and of the ongoing uncertainty and risks\nsurrounding the outlook, the FOMC —as I mentioned —maintained its collective judgment that\neconomic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at\nleast through late 2014, and it agreed to provide further support to the economy by continuing the m aturity e xtension program . The C ommittee is prepared to take further action as appropriate\nto promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability .\nThank you. I’d be glad to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC . Mr. Chairman, looking back on the last\nfour years of Fed policy, I think it ’s probably fair to say it has been bold and yet at the same time\nhalting . You did QE1 and then you stopped and then you did QE2. You did “ Operation T wist”\nand you told us it was going to end in June ; now you’ ve extended it . How would you respond if ,\nseveral years from now, a young MIT graduate student came forward and said, “ You know what\nthe problem with Fed policy was during this period is it was too incremental, and that the reason\nwhy the economy underperformed was because of that incrementalism.” And what do you think\nthe dangers are right now that today ’s action is also too incremental?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well , of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in\na continuous fashion until December of 2008. And since then, we ’ve been operating with\nnonsta ndard monetary tools , including asset purchases and extension of maturities . By their\nnature, these tend to be lumpy . We haven ’t done them in a continuous way . But our view of the\neffects of these programs on the economy is that the total stock of outstanding securities in our\nportfolio is what determines the level of accommodation that the economy is receiving . So in\nthat respect, it wouldn’ t be really a start and stop ; rather, whenever we have stopped purchasing ,\nthe level of accommodation that was already in the system remains there until conditions warrant further action . Now, underlying all this, of course, is the fact that the outlook has changed . Like\nmany other forecasters, the Federal Reserve was too optimistic early in the recovery about the pace of recovery . And we ’ve had to add additional accommodation going forward, as we have\nseen, in fact , that the headwinds have kept the recovery from being as strong as we would like .\nBut, again, by the nature of these unconventional tools, they are —tend to be more discreet in\ntheir size , but they continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases\nhas end ed.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Don ’t you worry about incrementalism now?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we ’ve taken a step today , which is a substantive step ,\nwhich will provide additional accommodation for the economy . And , moreover, we have stated\nthat we ’re prepared to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery\nin the labor market . So, we are prepared to do what ’s necessary . We are prepared to provide\nsupport for the economy.\nMARK FELSENTHAL. Mark Felsenthal with Reuters . Mr. Chair man, many analysts\nhave characterized today ’s step as somewhat modest . Your own outlook has a much lower GDP\n\nprojection. The unemployment rate in your outlook is —shows possibly no improvement at all in\nthe unemployment rate through the end of this year . The program itself is smaller and of shorter\nduration than the original O peration T wist. Given this weaker outlook, why such a modest\nprogram? And when you say you are prepared to take further action, which is a stronger\ncharacterization than in your la st meeting, does that mean you are prepared to do a full -on new\nasset purchase program?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, there ’s been a great deal of economic news since our\nlast meeting . The incoming data were somewhat disappointing —but not entirely clear how t o\nread them . We had issues with weather and seasonal adjustment and other factors . Meanwhile,\nEurope has had additional problems . We ’ve seen some of those effects in financial markets . So,\nI think, there is some case to be made for making some additional judgments about where the economy is going . That being said, the step we took, the extension of the maturity e xtension\nprogram , I think, is a substantive step , and it will provide some additional support . And yes,\nadditional asset purchases would be among the things that we would certainly consider if we need to take additional measures to strengthen the economy.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr. Chairman, I ’d\nlike to ask you to respond to a different set of criticisms . This criticism—whi ch you hear from\nCapitol Hill and Wall Street and different places —is that the Fed has already pushed interest\nrates to an extraordinarily low level, a historically low level, and that there isn ’t anything more\nthat the Fed can do to help the recovery . That —the criticism is that the Fed at this point should\nstand down and let Congress or the White House attend to the economy ’s ailments or let market\nforces attend to the economy ’s ailments . What do you think of those arguments , and how would\nyou respond to them?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE. Well, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a\npanacea. Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems . We welcome\nhelp and support from any other part of the government, from other economic policymakers . So,\ncollaboration is —would be great . I wouldn’ t accept the proposition, though, that the Fed has no\nmore ammunition . I do think that our tools, while they are nonstandard, still can create\nmore -accommodative financial cond itions, can still provide support for the economy, can still\nhelp us return to a more normal economic situation. That being said , again, any other support\nthat is forthcoming, any other economic policies that are undertaken that are helpful in terms of\nmaking our economy stronger are welcome . But I do think that monetary policy still does have\nsome capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial con ditions.\nZACH GOLDFARB. Thank you. Mitt Romney recently said that QE2 had a relatively\nlittle impact on the economy . He said that was in part because of the P resident ’s policies, and he\nsaid that QE3 was unwarranted and could have negative effects . Do you agree that QE2 had\nlittle effect on the economy? Do you think the P resident ’s policies has had an effect on the\neffectiveness of monetary policy? And do you think it ’s appropriate for a presidential candidate\nto comment on the future path of monetary policy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I ’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset\npurchase programs, so -called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and\nfinancial conditions . And although there were certain problems in transm ission —for example,\nthe housing market has not been as responsive as it ’s been in some times in the past —we do\nthink that they were both effective in providing support for the economy , and in particular, so-\ncalled QE2 ended what looked to be an incipient deflation problem when we first introduced it .\nSo, I do think those have been eff ective , and as I said to Mr. Hils enrath, we think that these kinds\n\nof programs can still provide additional support . With respect to the rest of your questions, I just\nwant t o reiterate that the Federal Reserve is nonpartisan, we are very serious about taking our\ndecisions based on purely economic grounds without political considerations, and we ’ll continue\nto do that.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Thanks . Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times. Long -term\ninterest rates, mortgage rates are already at historic lows . How much more help can an extension\nof Operation T wist do and—to lower interest rates?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the interest rates are quite low , and they ’re being\npushed down more by safe -haven flows and other factors . That being said, I think we can lower\ninterest rates more . But beyond that, Operation T wist and asset purchases work also through\nother channels . In particular, by acquiring securities in the market and bringi ng them onto the\nFed’s balance sheet , we essentially induce investors to move into substitute securities . So, for\nexample, an investor who sells a T reasury security to the Fed may end up buying a corporate\nbond instead, and so the effect will be to lower corporate bond rates and corporate spreads . Or a\nbank may, having sold its T reasury securities, may decide to make a loan instead . So, it ’s not\njust the effect on the long- term interest rate, but there ’s a broader set of effects that feed through\nother a sset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial\nconditions which is supportive to the economy.\nJEFF KEARNS. Thank you. Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg News . Given the projections\ntoday going out to ’ 14, seeing unempl oyment almost where it is now for another two years, can\nyou look past 2014, and can you—now that we ’re five years past the top of the stock market, six\nyears past the top of the housing market, can this go on for a decade? Can this go on longer?\nCan you reassure Americans that it won ’t go on for a dozen years like the D epression ?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’ s our intention to do all we can to make sure that it\ndoesn’ t go on indefinitely . Unemployment is still too high , but it has come down. It was abo ut\n10 percent at the peak , and now it ’s closer to 8 percent . It’s going down too slowly , but it is\ngoing down. Our sense is that people are finding jobs , but just not at the rate that we would like\nto see. And, you know, as I said, and as the statement says, if we don’ t see continued\nimprovement in the labor market, we ’ll be prepared to take additional steps if appropriate.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times . I’m looking at the\nprojections you all released today that show that unemploy ment will be between 8 and\n8.2 percent at the end of the year . You told Congress earlier this month that the defining factor\nin your decision about whether to do more would be whether unemployment was coming down.\nThat’s barely a decrease. And I guess I ’m struggling to understand why , in that context, you are\nnot doing more now , particular ly when you say that you can do more and that you would do\nmore if it wasn ’t happening.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, first of all, again, we are—we did take a substantive\nstep today by extending the m aturity extension program to the end of the year . Again, I think\nthat’s a meaningful additional step.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The projections included that step, right?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It depends on— each individual has their own path of\noptimal policy , so we ’ll provide more information about that in the minutes . But —and again,\nwe’re prepared to do more . We have to get, I think, further information about the state of the\neconomy, about where things are going, about what ’s happening in Europe . I guess I would add\nto that, though, that, you know, each of these nonstandard programs does have various costs and\nrisks associated with it with respect to market functioning, with respect to financial stability, with\n\nrespect to the exit process, and so I don’ t think they should be launched lightly . I think there\nshould be some conviction that they ’re needed, but if we do come to that conviction, then we ’ll\ntake those additional steps.\nKRISTINA PETERSON. Kri stina Peterson , Dow Jones . I know that you’ ve said that\nEuropean policymakers are the first line of defense for the European debt crisis, but under what\ncircumstances would the Fed decide to get more directly involved or coordinate action with other centr al banks?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line . Europe is\na wealthy area. They have adequate resources to address these problems . They are very\ncommitted to addressing these problems because keeping the e uro zone together, keeping the\neuro-zone trading bloc together is very important to the economies of those countries, so we\nleave to them the leadership . The Federal Reserve is very much involved in talking with and\nconsulting with European leaders . I talk frequently to central bankers in Europe, including\nMario Draghi and others . We try to provide whatever help and support we can. We did , of\ncourse , coordinate earlier in the provision of the dollar swaps to other central banks, which have\nbeen useful in reducin g pressures in dollar funding markets and allowing European banks to\ncontinue lending in dollars , including to U .S. borrowers . So, at this point , we are consulting\nfrequently . We are prepared to work together if that can be done constructively . But at this\npoint, you know, we are mostly just in consultation mode.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business . Sir, you had talked about trying to get\nmaybe a little help from some of the other branches of government , so that leads to the questions\nabout the “ fiscal cliff .” Have you seen any evidence that the lack of progress on resolving the\nfiscal -cliff issue is having an impact on the economy right now? Is it slowing economic growth\n\nright now, job creation as we saw last year during this very same debate ? And if you’ re not\nseeing it, and if you haven’ t seen it yet, when could we —might we start to see it hit the economy\nand hurt the economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I think it’ s still a bit early, but as we move forward in\nthe year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so -called fiscal cliff will have\nsome economic effects . We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be\ngovernment contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contract s would still be\nin place come January and making employment decisions based on that . More generally,\nfinancial markets don ’t like uncertainty and, particularly, uncertainty of this magnitude , and that,\nI think, will be a negative . So that uncertainty is there, that ’s goi ng to be an issue . I think most\nimportantly , though, is that Congress get the policy right . I’ve talked about three elements for\nfiscal policy . The first is to do no harm as far as the recovery is concerned, to try to avoid a\nfiscal cliff that would sig nificantly damage the recovery . But second, to maintain the effort to\nachieve a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term . And third, to use fiscal policy\neffectively —to have a better tax code, to make good use of government spending programs and\nmake them efficient and effective, and so on. So I think if Congress does all those things, the\nultimate benefits would be substantial.\nPETER COOK. Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television. If I could follow up on my\ncolleague Peter Barnes ’s question regarding the fiscal cliff, just listening to your answer here,\nhow beneficial would it be for the U .S. economy right now, given some of the ta lk on Capitol\nHill that the law makers and the A dministration deal with the fiscal -cliff issues, perhaps\ntemporarily kick th e can down the road into next year, deal with i t sooner rather than later .\n\nWould that end —limit, at least , some of that uncertainty in the short term ? Would that be\nbeneficial given the state of the economy at this present moment?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, that’ s a difficult problem . I’m not entirely sure . On\nthe one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because\npeople are uncertain about what ’s going to happen. On the other hand, investors I know would\nlike to see Congress take actions that put us on a long -term, sustainable fiscal path , and simply\nkicking the can down the road without any other indication of what might be done, what kinds of policies might be enacted , could be a negative for sentiment be cause it might induce people to\nworry more about the seriousness of Congress in addressing our fiscal issues.\nSHAHIEN NASIRIPOUR. Shah ien Nasiripour with the Financial Times . Mr.\nChairman, one crit ique of the Fed ’s accommodative actions over the past few years has been that\nit’s helped those with the least propensity to spend —the wealthy , large businesses and\ncorporations —while the Fed ’s impact on those with the most propensity to spen d—the cash -\nstrapped and middle -income households —has been muted. I was hoping that you could perhaps\naddress this criticism, particularly with a focus on access to credit.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure . Well, access to credit is a major issue , there’ s no\nquestion about it . Mortgage access is much tighter than it ’s been for a lo ng time . Even credit\ncard access is more restricted than it has been in the past . And that —what that does is , to some\nextent , it mutes the impact of the Fed ’s actions . That being said, I don’ t think it’ s at all accurate\nto say that Federal Reserve polic y is not helping the broad public . First of all, many Americans\nare able to take advantage of lower interest rates . Many people have refinanced or bought\nhomes . Others have taken out loans to buy cars . Auto loans are cheap and broadly available .\nSo, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect\n\neffects . If a firm has a low cost of capital, and we ’ve seen a lot of corporate borrowing in the last\ncouple of years, then they ’re more likely to expand, to add c apital, to add products , and ,\nconsequently, they are more likely to hire . And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls\nhave increased in the last few years has been disappointing , there have been significant increases ,\nand the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points . Some of that comes from the\nbroad impact of Fed policy on spending , on investment , and those effects affect the broad public\nindirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing .\nKEVIN HALL. Hi, thanks . Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers . If you could flesh\nout a little bit more detail about what —where you think the choke points are in the economy .\nSIFMA yesterday had their midyear outlook conference call in which they blamed a full\npercentage point of the slowdown on fiscal cliff and, more importantly , Europe and said, you\nknow, much bigger pass -through than anyone anticipated . Today , the Business Roundtable said,\nEurope , not so much; it’s basically the economy . The CEO of Boeing said, clearly , we’re\nalready t rimming jobs, we ’re already cutting back ; everybody else in the a erospace, he thinks, is\ndoing the same . What are you hearing? Are you on t he phone with people your predecessor was\ngiven to calling occasionally ? What is your sense of where the choke points are that are\ncontinuing to thwart hiring?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure . I gave a list of some of the headwinds in my opening\nremarks . I do think that the European situation is slowing U .S. economic growth. First of all,\nEurope is , if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and\nthat affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products . More br oadly, the effects of\nEuropean concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth .\n\nSo that has been an issue . And more broadly, we ’ve seen some slowing in global economic\ngrowth more generally , including in Asia , which also has reduced somewhat our ability to\nexport . So that ’s one set of concerns that ’s been important . I’d mentioned two others, I think, as\nbeing primarily important. One is housing . Housing usually plays a very important role in\neconomic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because\nhigher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending . Housing does\nseem to be doing somewhat better . There are some good signs in housing , but nevertheless , we\nare not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the recovery that we would normally get from a housing recovery . The other area is, as you indicated, is fi scal. And that happens at\nall different levels : federal, state, and local . Notwithstanding programs earlier on, in the last\nyear or two and going forward we have been seeing fiscal consolidation. P articularly at the state\nand local level , of course, ti ght budgets have led to a lot of layoffs and cancellation of projects\nand so on. I understand that these are necessary steps from the perspective of individual states\nand localities . I’m not criticizing that; it’s just a fact, though, that these contract ions are\naffecting the pace of growth in the broader economy . So I think those would be the main things I\nwould point to, and put them all together , and you have an economy which is growing less\nquickly than it normally would following a recession of the magnitude that we saw.\nMARCY GORDON. Thank you. Marcy Gordon with the AP . Given the environment\nthat you’ ve sketched out and the fact that interest rates are at historically low points, would it\nmake sense—would it be an option for t he government to issue more long -term debt at this point\nand take advantage of that?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the government is very gradually increasing the\nduration of its debt —the T reasury , I mean —and it ’s been doing that for some period of time .\n\nTher e’s a bit of an issue here , which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program\nwe announced today, the maturity extension p rogram , is we ’re taking longer -term debt off the\nmarket in order to induce investors to move into other assets and to l ower longer -term interest\nrates . To the extent that the T reasury actively sought to lengthen duration of its borrowing, it\nwould, to some extent, offset the benefits of that —of those policies . So my understanding of\nwhat the T reasury is doing is that the y have a plan, they ’re sticking to that plan, and therefore , on\nthe margin , the effects of the Fed ’s actions can be felt.\nDARREN GERSH. Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report . You clearly seem to be\nwaiting on the labor market . Can you be a little mo re specific? What exactly are you looking\nfor? Is there a rate of job growth you need to look —to see? And also, if the unemployment rate\ncomes down, is that enough? O r are you going to also look at labor participation and the whole\ngestalt ?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I can ’t give you any specific numbers because this is\nultimately a C ommittee decision, but what the C ommittee is going to do is review all the labor\nmarket indicators , including unemployment, including participation , and other measures of labor\nmarket activity , and try to make a sense—try to get a sense of whether or not the labor market is\nimproving in a sustainable way . It’s not a month- to-month proposition. You know, this year\nalready, we’ ve seen a few months of very strong job gains , and we saw two months of weaker\ngains . Obviously, month to month, there is going to be statistical noise —there is going to be\nweather, there ’s going to be a lot of factors that can cause job gains to vary . So the question is, is\nthe improvement sustainable? Is it long lasting? That ’s the kind of thing that we ’ll be looking\nat, but I really can ’t be too much more specific than that.\n\nSTEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner , Market News International . Mr. Chairman, when\nwe—when you speak of the fiscal cliff , typically you don’ t differentiate between the automatic\ntax-hike aspect of that and the automatic spending cuts , which leaves the impression that you are\ngiving equal weight to both sides . Some would contend that the automatic tax hikes would be\nmore one rous. How do you parse the relative importance of those two aspects? And if I may be\npermitted, I am also curious to know how the Fed is going to conduct open market operations, if,\nas the New York Fed statement says, by the end of this year, they will e ssentially have no\nshort -term securities to use.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, on the fiscal cliff, I mean, just the way that the\nprograms are set up, the dollar amount associated with the tax e xpirations —tax -cut expirations,\nincluding the payroll tax cut and so on, is larger than the spending cuts, as I understand it . But\nI’m not making any judgment about individual programs . The point here is that putting all these\nthings together, you have a very substantial withdrawal of income from the economy that will affect spending and will affect the ability of the economy to recover in the short run. Now,\nagain , in making decisions about, you know, how to modify those automatic changes, Congress\nobviously has to look at the long run, you know —what is the most effic ient tax structure, what ’s\nthe best way to spend our limited resources? Those are tough decisions that Congress has to make, but in terms of the fiscal cliff, in terms of what’ s going to happen in January, the —it’ s\nreally the total of both spending cuts a nd tax increases which has the impact, which not only we,\nbut others like the Congressional Budget Office , have identified as being a concern . We’ ll still\nbe able to do open market operations with our securities, even if the amount of short -term debt is\nvery low . And indeed, of course, over time, the —as securities come close to maturation, we will\nhave other securities that are of short duration.\n\nDONNA BORAK. Hi C hairman, Donna Borak with American Banker . There have been\na lot of questions raised as to whether the Volcker rule would have helped prohibit the trading\nloss of J .P. Morgan . Given that regulators are in the middle of the rule -writing process and also\nexamining what exactly went wrong, as a supervisor, do you think at this moment it ’s the right\ntime to perhaps “ pump the brake s,” so to speak, and slow down the rule -writing process or has\nthis recent episode really made it a stronger case for proceeding with the Volcker r ule\nexpeditiously ? And , secondly, if I may, since —given that you’ ve suggested that regulators\nmight be late on the rule , surpassing the July 21st deadline, could you perhaps give us a target on\nwhen regulators are looking to release the rule? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, on the second question, it ’s a five -agen cy rule , I\nbelieve, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like\n18,000 comment letters, so it’ s been a very difficult process in terms of the amount of work that\nhas to be done, amount of coordination that has to be done, so I don’ t have a date for you . I\nthink if there ’s a silver lining to the events you referred to, it may be that there’ s some things we\ncan learn in terms of writing the rule and thinking about how it would work . One aspect of our\nrule that I think w ould have been important in the context of the loss is that , in the rule, a bank\nwould be required to provide a plan in advance explaining how the hedge was going to be done, how it was going to work . It would be necessary to have an auditing process to m ake sure that ,\nin fact , that was being followed, that there were adequate risk management and governance rules\nto oversee the process , and it would be necessary that compensation for the executives involved\nin the management of the position would not be su ch that it would incentivize them to take\nproprietary positions . So, one aspect of the rule that might have been relevant —and again, we\n\nare still looking at that situation , as are the OCC and others —would have been the control, the\ngovernance aspects of it, and that might have potentially changed the outcome.\nMARK GREGORY. Mark Gregory, BBC . How much worse will the situation in\nEurope have to get before it starts seriously denting the prospects for recovery in the American\neconomy, and thus really chang ing the direction of Fed ’s policymaking?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we hope it doesn’ t get worse . I think it ’s already one\nof the factors that has been a drag on U .S. recovery —not the only factor by any means, there are\na number of others that I mentioned, but it has been having an effect, and it ’s been having an\neffect on the economies of other countries as well, countries that export to Europe . So it is a\nsignificant issue . We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that ’s\nneces sary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that —\nin which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there ’s a program for growth, and in\nwhich fiscal arrangements are clear —are made much clearer . So there’ s a lot of work to be\ndone . Again, we think that the policymakers in Europe have very strong incentives to get this\nright, and we ’re very hopeful that they will get it right, and we are in close contact with them as\nthey work on these issues . But aga in, it is also important for us to be prepared for any further\nproblems that might emerge from Europe , and we have been doing that . For example, you know,\nwe recently did our stress tests of the large bank holding companies to make sure they had\nenough ca pital even in the face of a severe financial crisis or a European crisis . We have been\nmonitoring the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to Europe and, of course ,\nmonitoring the situation there very closely . So we are hoping for the best , we are hoping that\nEuropean policymakers will take the additional steps they need to take to stabilize the situation .\n\nBut we are prepared , in case things get worse , to protect the U .S. economy and the U .S. financial\nsystem.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman . Greg Robb, MarketWatch . I just want ed to\nget back to lending and credit . The U .K. has started a program where the Bank of England is\ngoing to make lending to banks only if they lend to households and companies . Is that\nsomething the Fed has under consideration? Would that be something you’ d start here?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We ll, we ’re very interested in it , and we ’re certainly going\nto follow it. The details are not yet available. A nd I think it should be noted that it ’s not just a\nBank of England program , but it ’s joint with the British T reasury . So the question—one\nquestion might be , how much of a fiscal component is there? Is there some kind of fiscal\nsubsidy being included there?\nBut we are looking for —as you know , throughout the crisis, we ’ve looked for new\nprograms, new ways to help the economy . And this will be a type of thing that will be on the list\nof programs that we look at.\nGREG IP. Hi. Greg Ip of the Economist . You have an inflation target of 2 percent , but\nyour projections show inflation centered below 2 percent over the medium term . I was\nwondering if you could explain why . And secondly, you said that the Fed is prepared to do more\nif necessary . Could you briefly comment on what sort of form additi onal action might take ?\nAnd, specifically, what are the relative costs and benefits of doing more QE versus more\nmaturity extension?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the —in terms of the inflation forecasts, again , I think\nit should be said, as a preliminary poin t, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty\n\nabout them . We talk about that uncertainty in the survey of e conomic projections . So we\nshouldn’ t take a false sense of precision from those numbers.\nThat being said, there is an issue about whether or not there ’s sufficient stimulus in the\neconomy . As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the\ntypes of unconventional programs that are available are—we know less about them , they have\nvarious costs and risks , and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial\naccommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short -term interest rates can\nbe varied freely . So I think that ’s really a critical issue.\nNow, in terms of t he costs, I would list , briefly , large asset purchases increase the size of\nour balance sheet and therefore ultimately will make exit a more extended process . Large asset\npurchases —which means that the Fed owns a larger share of a particular type of asset —may\nhave im plications for market functioning , which in turn might affect the ability of the Fed to\nhave stimulative effects on the economy . There are some financial stability issues that we are\nmonitoring and that have to be taken into account . So any kind of asses sment of appropriate\npolicy must look both at the outlook for the economy and for —and at the cost s and risks\nassociated with new measures, new steps that might be taken.\nThat being said, again, I think at this point, we still do have considerable scope to do\nmore , and we are prepared to do more . We ’ll continue to monitor the economy and see how\nthings evolve . And if —again, we ’re looking primarily at the labor market in this respect—i f\nwe’re not seeing a sustained improvement in the labor market, that would require additional\naction .\n\nIn terms of balance sheet actions, we are unlikely to do more maturity extension for a\nwhile because we have taken that about as far as we can . So we would have to take other types\nof steps in order to add to the amount of stimulus in the economy.\nTOSHIKI YAZAWA. Thank you, Chairman . I’m Toshiki Yazawa from Nikkei . I hear a\nlot of conversations on liquidity trap in U .S. That was a familiar concept in Japan after a bubble\nburst in the l ost decades . Is U .S. economy in liquidity trap? A nd if that happens, how could\neconomy escape from here? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the U .S. economy is in a situation where short -term\ninterest rates are close to zero . And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add\nmonetary accommodation by cutting short -term interest rates, the usual approach . It’s been one\nof the themes of my own work for a long time , including some of the work I did on the B ank of\nJapan , that central banks are not out of tools once the short -term interest rate hits zero . There are\nadditional steps that can be taken . And we have demonstrated through both communications\ntechniques —guidance about future policy , which is something the Japanes e have done as well ,\nby the way—a nd through as set purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done , that\ncentral banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery\neven when short -term interest rates are close to zero .\nThat being said, as I mentioned to Mr. I p, these nonstandard policies are less well\nunderstood, and they do have some cost s and risks . But I do think that , at the same time , that\nthey can be effective in helping the economy.\nJENNIFER LIBERTO. Jennifer Liberto, CNNMoney . Chairman, are you at all\nconcerned that O peration T wist could affect banks ’ earnings and their willingness to lend? Does\nit undercut your ability to increase credit to consumers?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Credit to consumers? No, I don’ t think so. If—take, fo r\nexample, I ’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to\nlend. I don ’t think that ’s quite right . What we’ re lowering is the safe interest rate, the T reasury\nrate. That should make it even more attractive for banks , rather than to hold securities , to look\nfor borrowers and to earn the spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending to\nhouseholds and businesses .\nSo I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, i n fact , support lending . Now, the\nquestion arises in some context s whether there are other barriers to lending as exist , for example,\nin some parts of the mortgage market . But lower interest rates on securities and other types of\nassets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for highe r-yielding returns, higher -yielding\nassets in the form of loans to household and businesses.\nMER RILL GOOZNER. Merril l Goozner, the Fiscal Times . Returning to Europe ,\nbriefly —some analysts have said that should the situation deteriorate there , the Fed could step in\nby buying European sovereign debt of various countries . Are there any countries that you would\nrule out in such a strategy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The Federal Reserve isn ’t going to be buying European\nsovereign debt, except we have a v ery limited amount of European sovereign debt as part of our\nforeign exchange reserves , and it comes primarily from a small number of countries . So that ’s\nnot something that we would be engaged in.\nCATHERINE HOLLANDER. You ha ve two new Fed Governors aboa rd. Did that\nchange the tenor of the discussion at all this week ? And did Jeremy Stein and Jay Powell push\nyou in any particular policy direction?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, they are two terrific people with great experience.\nI’ve known Jeremy for a long time . He ’s an outstanding academic and knows a lot about\nfinance. Jay has both market experience and a lot of experience in government . They both bring\na lot to the table . This was their first meeting , so I think, to some extent, they were in listenin g\nmode . But they do have an awful lot to offer , and I really do look forward to working with them\nbecause I think that they are exceptional people . And I ’m glad, f or the first time —I believe it ’s\nthe case that this is the first time that we had seven Governors at an FOMC meeting since 2005.\nSo it’s great to have a full complement of people , and it will help us do our other work as well as\nour monetary policy work more effectively.\nCATHERINE HOLLANDER. Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you."
