  "text": "September 18 , 2019\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone, and welcome. My colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people. We do this by steadfastly\npursuing the goals Congress has given us : maximum employment and stable prices. We are\ncommitted to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis. To day we\ndecided to lower interest rates. As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S.\neconomy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against\nongoing risks.\nThe U.S. economy has continued to perform we ll. We are into the 11th year of this\neconomic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable. The eco nomy grew at a\n2½ percent pace in the first half of the year. H ousehold spending—support ed by a strong job\nmarket, rising incomes, and solid con sumer confidence —has been the key driver of growth. In\ncontrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output .\nThe main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments —two\nsources of uncertainty that we ’ve been monitoring all year.\nSince the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened , notably in Europe\nand China. Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved.\nTrade policy tensions have waxed a nd waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S.\ninvestment and exports. Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that\nuncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses. B usiness\nfixed inves tment posted a modest decline in the second quarter , and recent indicators point to\ncontinued softness. Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with\nsupportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate.\n\nAs seen from FOMC participants ’ most recent projections , the median expectation for real GDP\ngrowth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated\nlonger -run value.\nThe job market remains strong . The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows\nfor a year and a half, and job gains have remain ed solid in recent months. The pace of job gains\nhas eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.\nParticipation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing. And\nwages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs. People who live and work in low -\nand middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now\ngetting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives. This underscores , for us , the\nimportance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left\nbehind. We expect the job market to remain strong . The m edian of participants’ projections for\nthe unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.\nInflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months\nthrough July, t otal PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation , which excludes volatile food\nand energy prices, w as 1.6 percent. We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median\nprojection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1 However, inflation pressures clearly\nremain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their\nhistorical ranges. We are mindful that continued below -target inflation could lead to an\nunwelcome downward slide in longer -term inflation expectations.\nOverall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion\nof economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year.\n\nobjective as most likely. While this has been our outlook for quite some time , our views about\nthe path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over\nthe past year. As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have\nweighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks . These factors, i n conjunction with muted\ninflation pressures , have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time\ntoward a lower path for the federal funds rate , and this shift has supported the outlook. Of\ncourse, this is the role of monetary poli cy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor\nmarket and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective.\nToday’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent , to 1.75 percent to 2\npercent , is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation\npressures. Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a\nresurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs. The Fed has\nno role in the for mulation of trade policy, but we do take into account anything that could\nmaterially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals.\nThe future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what\ndevelopments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook. We have often said that\npolicy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today. As I have noted, the baseline\neconomic outlook remains positive. The projections of appropriate policy show that participants\ngenerally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years .\nOf course, those views are merely forecasts and , as always, will evolve with the arrival of new\ninformation.\nLet me say a few words about our monetary policy operations. Funding pressures in\nmoney markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top\n\nof its target range yesterday. While these issues are important for market functioning and market\npartici pants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy. This\nupward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet\ncorporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities. To counter these pressures,\nwe conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today. These temporary\noperations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to\nmove back into the target range. In addition, as w e have done in the past, we made a technical\nadjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis\npoints below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In a related action, we also\nadjusted the r ate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the\ntarget range. We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as\nnecessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range. Consistent\nwith our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves\nregime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are\nnot required.\nTo summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment\nand stable prices. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the\necon omic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market\nand inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\nThanks . I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Pres s. Mr. Chairman,\nwhen you cut rates in July, you characterized it as a “midcycle adjustment .” Is that still your\nview of what ’s happening?\nCHAIR POWELL . So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we\nsee a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and\ninflation near our 2 percent objective . And , by the way, that view is consistent with those of\nmany other forecasters. As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive\neconomic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate . At the\nlast press conference, I pointed to two episodes in , I guess , 1995 and 1998 as examples of such\nan approach, which was successful in both of those instances . As our statement also highlights ,\nthough, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade\ndevelopments . And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts\ncould be appropriate . We don’ t see that —it’s not what we expect —but we would certainly\nfollow that path if it became appropriate . In other words, as we say in our statement, we will\ncontinue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure\nthat the ex pansion remains on track.\nRICHARD MILLER. [ Inaudible remark ] I’m sorry . Rich Miller with Bloomberg .\nTaking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP, I ’m just wondering what kind of\nmessage we should take from this. Do you still —does the FOMC —is it safe to say the FOMC\nstill has an easing bias or not?\nCHAIR POWELL . So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime\npractice, and we don ’t actually have that practice anymore, so I can ’t really adopt it right here .\nBut, nonetheless, I ’ll respond to your question. So we did—we made one decision today, and\n\nthat decision was to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point . We believe that action is\nappropriate to promote our objectives, of course . We’re going to be highly data dependent, as\nalways. Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the\noutlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we ’re not on a preset course. So that ’s how\nwe’re going to look at it . We’re going to be care fully looking at economic data . Sometimes the\npath ahead is clear and sometimes less so . So we ’re going to be looking carefully, meeting by\nmeeting , at the full range of information, and we ’re going to assess the appropriate stance of\npolicy as we go. A nd, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\nRICHARD MILLER. If I could just follow up, you’ ve also said that the favorable\noutlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in tur n predicated\non an outlook for F ed policy— in this case, further cuts . Wouldn’ t that suggest that you should\nbe inclined to—if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about,\nyou should be inclined to cut?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, what we do going f orward is very much going to depend, Rich,\non the flow of data and information. We’ve seen —you know, if you look at the things we ’re\nmonitoring, particularly global growth and trade development s, global growth has continued to\nweaken . I think it ’s weaken ed since our last meeting . Trade developments have been up and\ndown and then up, I guess —or back up, perhaps —over the course of this intermeeting period . In\nany case, they ’ve been quite volatile . So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now .\nWe’re going to be watching that carefully. We ’re also going to be watching the U.S . data quite\ncarefully, and we ’ll have to make an assessment as we go.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Thank you, Mr . Chairman . Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street\nJournal. I know you’ re trying to speak for the C ommittee when you do these press conferences,\n\nbut the C ommittee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate\npolicy path. Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer\ncrack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time\nthat happens, you’ ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn. Where do you\nstand on this?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives,\nyou’re right . Sometimes the —and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight\nyears at the Fed, many times when the direction i s relatively clear and it ’s relatively easy to reach\nunanimity. This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives. And\nI really do think that ’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse\nperspectives , really . So your question, though, is?\nNICK TIMIRAOS . This is to your own view , because the data is, to some extent , lagged,\nespecially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these\nrisks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot\ntoday. So, I w onder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management,\nwhich implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent ?\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes. S o I’ll try to get at that this way . I think that the idea that if\nyou s ee trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can—I think that ’s a\ngood idea in principle , and I think history teaches us that it ’s better to be proactive in adjusting\npolicy if you can.\nI think applying that principle in a particula r situation is where the challenge comes. So I\ntold you where the C ommittee —the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I\nthink the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly,\n\nconsistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has felt that it ’s\nappropriate . At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were\npatient, and then we cut once, then we cut again. And I think you’ ve seen u s being willing to\nmove based on data, based on the evolving risk picture , and I have no reason to think that will\nchange . I think —but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend—data includes the\nevolving risk picture . That ’s where I am, and that ’s where I think the bulk of the C ommittee is.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Mr . Chairman, I wonder if you’ re—oh, sorry. Steve Liesman,\nCNBC. I ’ve only done this a dozen —a lot of times . I wonder if you’ re concerned about how the\nFederal Reserve operated through the re cent liquidity crunch in markets . We talked to many\ntraders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance . There were several reports of\npeople pointing to September as a potential crunch time . You closed Monday at the top end of\nthe fed funds rate. Tuesday came along, and ther e wasn ’t an operation until nine o’clock and no\nannouncement until —of a second operation until four o’clock in the afternoon. Was the F ed\nlistening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the\novernight rate at year -end and the turn of the year? Are you concerned about how, for example,\nthe New York F ed operated through this?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has\nmore invested in carefully following the —you know, the behavior of these markets . So, of\ncourse, we were well aware of the —you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the\nlarge bond purchases . And, you know, we were very much waiting for that . But we didn’ t\nexpect —the response to that was stronger than we expected . And, by the way, our sense is that it\nsurprised market participants a lot , too. You know , people were writing about this and\npublishing stories about it weeks ago . It wasn ’t a surprise, but it was —it was a stronger response\n\nthan—certainly than we expected . So, no, I ’m not concerned about that , to answer your\nquestion. I can go on a little bit about how we ’re looking at that . Why don’ t I do that?\nSo, as I mentioned, it doesn’ t—we don ’t see this as havin g any implications for the\nbroader economy or for the economic outlook, n or for our ability to control rates . The strains in\nthe money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I\nthink most folks anticipated —strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate\ntaxes. We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within\nthe target range, and those measures were successful . If we experience another episode of\npressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures. We will not hesitate\nto use them .\nAnd since we ’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this. Earlier in the\nyear, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee\nannounced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime. And we ’ve\nbeen operating in that regime for a full decade . We think it works well to implement our rate\ndecisions . The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered\nrates— the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range. It ’s designed\nspecifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that\npurpose . So, going forward, we ’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments\nand assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’ re going to be\nassessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of\nour balance sheet . And I ’m sure we’ ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period\nand certainly at our next meeting.\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Could I just follow up here quickly? D o you think you’ ve\nunderestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system?\nCHAIR POWELL . So we ’ve always said that it ’s—that the level is uncertain, right ?\nAnd that ’s something we ’ve tried to be very clear about . And as you know, we ’ve invested lots\nof time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their —what they say is their\ndemand for reserves. We try to assess what that is. We ’ve tried to combine all of that together .\nWe put it out so the public can react to it. But , yes, there ’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly\npossible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we\nthought . That ’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now . Again, we ’ll be looking at this\ncarefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting.\nBRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times . Earlier this year —\nor, actually , in September, the G overnors ’ Board put out a research paper looking—trying to\nquantify trade uncertainty. A nd it suggested that it could drag through the busine ss investment\nchannel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year . How much\nconfidence do you have in the F ed’s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty ? And\nif you have confidence in that paper, it would see m to suggest a —sort of a more aggressively\ndovish path than the one that you ’ve chosen.\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes. So I thin k to provide a little context, F ed economists do\nresearch all the time . It’s generally of very high quality. It ’s their research . It’s not an official\nfinding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System . It’s just —and, by the way,\nthey put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it —\ntheir whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession. So it ’s a great tradition that we\nhave . And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is , it went after measuring trade\n\npolicy uncertainty through a couple of channels , including concerning tariffs, also concerning the\nthreat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output . And\nwhile I would say, directly answering your question, there ’s real uncertainty around these —\naround these effects. It’ s a $22 trillion economy. T o try to isolate the effects of certain things is\nvery challenging, but we do the best we can. So —and this piece of research found significant\neffects, and that ’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists\nhave undertaken. It ’s also cons istent with what we ’ve been hearing in the Beige B ook. So, I\nmean , I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an\neffect . You see it in weak business investment, weak exports —hard to quantify it precisely ,\nthough.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I was struck by the sort\nof anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that\nyou now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the fed funds rate is\nheading. A nd I wondered, is it fair to say that the —those opinions have become sort of firmer in\ntheir conviction, and that it ’s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now\nfor that to move in either direction ?\nCHAIR POWELL . And you’ re asking specifically about 2020?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, the fact that this —the fed funds rate is now seen as not\nmoving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty—pretty well anchored right\nnow in those groups.\nCHAI R POWELL. You know, honestly, I think it ’s hard to have hardened expectations\nabout where rate policy is going to be a year from now . I think the closer you get to the c urrent\nday, the more confidence you can have . But even then, knowing where the—knowi ng what the\n\ndata will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next\n90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there ’s a lot of uncertainty\naround that .\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Fair enough, but if —\nCHAIR POWELL . Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is , individual\nparticipants write down their forecast s. It should give you a sense of how people are thinking\nabout the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for mone tary policy in that\nindividual person’ s thinking, and I think that ’s a good thing to know . I think I ’d be very\nreluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction , really.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But just to follow up, if I could. T here were a number of\narguments in July around the reason for cutting rates . Have any of those gotten substantially\nweaker or changed around the table?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, well , I think , if you look at the U.S.—look at the U.S .\neconomy, the U.S . economy has generally per formed roughly as expected —roughly: The\nconsumer is spending at a healthy clip, I ’d say business fixed investment and exports have\nweakened further, and I ’d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead . The labor\nmarket is still strong , though, s o generally that is the same . I think if you look at —the global\neconomy, I think , has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy\ndevelopments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that inter meeting\nperiod. So that ’s why I think what ’s—that ’s what ’s happened over the inter meeting period, and,\nyou know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times . I’m\njust curious on your balance sheet point . You talked about the C ommittee thinking about\n\nresuming organic growth, you know, over time . I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your\nbalance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get\nthrough sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back\nto a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times , or would you need to see\nsomething a little b it above that ? And is that a possibility the Committee would consider?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I think it ’s hard to deal with every hypothetical\npossibility. I think , for the foreseeable future, we ’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the\nsorts o f things that we did the last two days —these temporary open market operations . That will\nbe the tool that we use . And the question will be , then—as we go through quarter -end, as we\nlearn more, you know, what really —how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?\nAnd I think we ’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico . Another money market question.\nYou know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the\nvolatility we ’ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well . Are\nyou all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help ?\nAnd, also , what is the status of the net stable funding ratio rul e? Are you all still planning on\nputting that out soon?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the\nlevel of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’ d probably raise the level of reserves\nrather than lower the LCR. I mean , it’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the\nLCR is calibrated too high, but that ’s not something that we think right now . On the other hand,\nit might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to suppl y them . In\n\nterms of the net stable funding ratio, it ’s—I believe we put it out for comment and got\ncomments, and I believe we ’re looking at —at finalizing that in the relatively near future.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Just —just to follow up, I mean, in terms of twea ks to the LCR, I\nmean , there ’s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to\nmaybe dip into their liquidity buffers.\nCHAIR POWELL . I think we want banks to, you know —to use their liquidity buffers in\ntimes of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as\na general rule.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . So, about a month ago—Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness Network . Thank you, Mr . Chairman . About a month ago or so you said that there ’s no\nprecedent to integrate trade uncertainty in to monetary policy. In the last few weeks, have you\nfigured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty —and this level of trade uncertainty —into\nmonetary policy going forward ? You’ve talked about uncertainty many times today.\nCHAIR POWELL . So my point , really , was that —to start , that trade pol icy is not the\nbusiness of the F ed, it ’s the business of Congress and the A dministration . But —so why are we\ntalking about it? We ’re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our\ngoals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration. And\nour discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that ’s weighing\non the outlook. So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can ’t address, really , is what\nbusinesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade . We can ’t do that . We\ndon’t have that tool . But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to\nsome extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy. A nd we think our policy\ntools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels : by reducing interest\n\nburden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interest- sensitive\nitems ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending\nand also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence . So,\nyou know, I don’ t want to be heard to say that our tools don ’t have an effect . They do. B ut I\nwas making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can ’t address.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . So have you figured out how to navigatge it?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I think, yeah. I mean , it’s a challe nge. There ’s no simple\nbottom -line answer where I can say, yes, I ’ve got it for you here . But what it amounts to is this :\nWhat you see is probably the kind of volatility that ’s typical of an important , complex, ongoing\nnegotiation. And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to\nthe underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate .\nWe don’ t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements .\nWe’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum\nemployment and stable prices. So we need to look through what ’s a pretty volatile situation . So\nthat means not overreacting quickly. It means not underreacting, too. So t hat’s really what\nwe’re trying to do. And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these\ncrosswinds we’ ve felt . And so, to some extent , I do believe that our shifting to a more\naccommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook\nhas remained favorable.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Fed funds —Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and\nTelevision . Fed funds futures t rading since the statement was released shows that investors still\nthink that another rate cut is coming this year . On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide\nFed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or\n\nkeep them in place ? Are you reacting to data now? Are you reacting to your gut feeling about\nwhat trade tweets might mean? Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what ’s\ngoing to ha ppen going forward? What ’s the F ed’s reaction f unction now?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the\nevents that are going on around the world, we ’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving\ngeopolitical events , we’ll be looking at global growth, w e’ll be looking at trade policy\nuncertainty. Most importantly, we ’ll be looking at the performance of the U.S . economy. We’ll\nbe looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S . economy, particularly the outlook\nas it relates to maximum employment and stab le prices. So all of those things in principle can\naffect the achievement of our goals . It’s an unusual situation , because, you know, the U.S .\neconomy itself —the largest part of it, the consumer part of it —is in strong shape . The\nmanufacturing part, les s so. But , overall, you see an economy that —I think , generally , forecasts\nshow growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid\nyear. So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the\ngeopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty. So we ’ll\nbe looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the\noutlook. I can ’t—it’s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those\nthings . We ’re not on a preset course . We’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting\nas we see this, and , you know, we ’ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak. Hi, Chairman Powell. Donna Borak with CNN. With\nthe rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do you\nworry about lessening the F ed’s firepo wer should there be a recession? A nd is there any\n\nscenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory? A nd are there\nany other tools that you could use before having to go there? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I\nmentione d earlier, is , it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn\ngains momentum, and then—so there ’s a fair amount of research that would show that that ’s the\ncase. Now, I think that principle need s to be applied carefully to the situation at hand. Wha t we\nbelieve we’ re facing here—what we th ink we ’re facing here is a situation which can be\naddressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate. As I\nmentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case. If , in fact , the economy\nweakens more, then we ’re prepared to be aggressive, and we ’ll do so if it turns out to be\nappropriate.\nYou mentioned negative interest rates. So negative interest rates is some thing that we\nlooked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do. We chose to —after we got to the\neffective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale\nasset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used\nextensively. We feel that they worked fairly well. We did not use negative rates . And I think if\nwe were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not\nsomething we are expecting— then I think we would look at using large -scale asset purchases\nand forward guidance. I do not think we ’d be looking at using negative rates. I just don’ t think\nthose will be at the top of our list.\nBy the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we ’re looking\nthrough all of these questions about the longer -run framework —the strategy , tools , and\ncommunications —and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.\n\nDON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times . How much —can you talk about the\nmechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy ? And how much —to what\nextent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first,\nwe th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags. So I think the\nreal effects will be felt over time. But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce\ninterest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and\nother things like that —cars —it supports purchases of those. Just, again, broadly, more\naccommodative financial conditions —higher asset prices. T hat’s—the models and the data show\nthat that’s another powerful channel.\nI also think there ’s a confidence channel. You see —you see household and business\nconfidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative. So I think, through\nall of those channels , monetary policy works. It isn ’t, you know, precisely the right tool for\nevery single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but , nonetheless, it broadly\nworks, and, you know, we ’re going to use the tool we have. And if it comes to it, we ’ll use all of\nour tools . So that ’s how we think it works and how we think it ’s working.\nDON LEE. And how much will it offset the trade impact, do you think ?\nCHAIR POWELL. It ’s very hard to say. It’s —you know, it’ s tough to say. We ’ll—\nwe’ll us e our tools to offset negative —that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it\ncan, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable\nprices.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. I ’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to , or could create a bubble of ,\n\nconsumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for , especially , consumers to\nrecover from the next recession or survive the next recession?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so, if you look at —if you actually look at households,\nhouseholds are in very strong shape. They’ re less levered. They ’ve got less debt. They’ ve got\nmore income relative to their interest requirements. And they ’re in very good shape —much\nbetter shape than they were in before the financial crisis. So the household sector as a sort of\naggregate matter is in very good shape. That doesn’ t mean that every single person in the\nhousehold sector is in good shape, but , overall , it’s really not a concern.\nThe business sector is something that, you know, we ’ve talked about a lot and studied a\nlot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a\nhigh level. However, so is the size of the business sector. So, actually, the business sector itself\nis not materially higher leverage d tha n it was. Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered\ncompanies, and that ’s the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren ’t\ndownturns for , now , into our 11th year. You get —you know, you do get that kind of\nphenomenon in a long cycle.\nSo that ’s something we ’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’ s a real issue,\nbut what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn. It does not\nhave the makings of anything that w ould undermine the workings of the financial system, for\nexample, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down. It ’s more of —it’ s more of\nan amplifier. We take it very seriously , though, and, you know, we ’re monitoring it carefully.\nWe’re actually looking —the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now\nto identify where these loans are held all around the world. So it’ s the subject of a lot of study\nand work, and, you know, we ’re trying to keep on top of it.\n\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from Market Watch. I ’m kind\nof hearing two things from you. You’ re saying that the economy is doing well, but there ’s this\nsense with people that the economy is actually s tarting to slow now . And people are —more and\nmore , you talk—there ’s talk about recession, so you—and even the F ed thinks the downside\nrisks are rising. So is the economy over the next year —between now and the end of next year ,\ndo you think GDP growth is going to hold s teady , and the unemployment rate —could you talk\nabout , just , how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so, I think— and my colleagues and I , I think, all think\nthat the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and\ninflation moving back up to 2 percent. And I think that ’s, by the way, widely shared among\nforecasters. You know, the issue is more the risks to that. You have downside risks here, and\nwe’ve talked about them. It ’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time —\nless so than for many other economies, but , still, there ’s a sector of our economy that ’s exposed\nto that. Tra de policy uncertainty also has —apparently has an effect. So —and you can see some\nweakness in the U.S. economy because of all that. But , nonetheless —so the job of monetary\npolicy is to adjust both to e nsure against those downside risks , but also to support the economy in\nlight of the existing weakness that we do see. So we ’re not —as I mentioned , we’re not —we\ndon’t see a recession. We’ re not forecasting a recession. But we are adjusting monetary policy\nin a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook.\nGREG ROBB. And the invert ed yield curve that we hear is the b ond market signaling\nrecession —what do you—is that—so that ’s not —that signal is not pe rtinent to you ? Or where\ndo you—\n\nCHAIR POWELL. No, we do —so we monitor the yield curve carefully, along with a\nlarge , wide range of financial conditions. We don’t —so, it’s not —there ’s no one thing that is\ndispositive among all financial conditions. The yield curve is something that we follow\ncarefully. And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it ’s a positi ve\noutlook. The thing—so , just to talk about the current situation, you see —you saw long- term\nrates move down a whole lot and then retrace two -thirds of that move in the space of a few days.\nSo I think what really matters for all financial conditions gen erally is when there are changes—\nmaterial changes that are sustained for a period of time.\nSo—but why are long -term rates low? There are a number —there can be a signal about\nexpectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low term premiums. For\nexample, just —well, it can just be that there ’s this large quantity of negative -yielding and very\nlow-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably , that ’s exerting downward\npressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really ne cessarily having an independent signal.\nNonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would\naffect us. So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is\nsomething we pay careful —we’re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but —and I\nthink you can tell, on the C ommittee , there ’s a range of views —there are some who are very\nfocused on the yield curve, others not so much. You know, from my perspective, you watch it\ncareful ly, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield\ncurve is inverted as to why that is and how long it ’s sustained.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi , Chairman Powell. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.\nYou mentioned trade poli cy being a complex, ongoing discussion. What is your rule for\nstopping as far as interest rate cuts go? You refer red to this as a “ midcycle adjustment. ” The\n\nmedian dot suggest s no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back- and-\nforth between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened. So,\nyou know, under what circumstances would you say, “Y ou know what, I think we ’ve cut\nenough, we stop now ”? And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt a need to take\nany steps to boost , like , employee morale at a time when the President is constantly criticizing\nthe F ed? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I ’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward\nstopping rule, but it ’s really just goin g to be when we think we ’ve done enough. A nd, you know,\nour eyes are open. We ’re watching the situation. We ’ve cut rates twice. We’ ve moved, really ,\nthrough the course of this year, as I discussed, and , you know, we see ourselves as taking actions\nto sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals. And if you look at sort of the things that\nare happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion,\nbecause we really are reaching —this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’ t\nbeen reached in a long time. There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible,\nthat’s all. So I don’ t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we ’re watching carefully,\nand there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we ’ve done enough, but there may also\ncome a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively. We\ndon’t know. We ’re going to be watching things caref ully. The incoming data and the evolving\nsituation and —that ’s what ’s going to guide our —guide us on that path.\nIn terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it ’s very high. We ’re very unified.\nWe feel like we’ re doing the best job we can in ser ving the American people.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, Chairman. Hannah Lang with American Banker. It’s been\nreported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts.\n\nI’m wondering if the Fed is also investigating this a nd, given the pending order against Wells\nFargo , if you’ re concerned that these banks are too big to man age.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so I saw the headline , like, this morning during all of the\npreparation and everything and this morning’ s meeting. I really don ’t have anything for you on\nthat. I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk\nmanagement which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite\nharmful to the consumers and to the image o f the institution. I have no idea whether that ’s what\nhappened at Bank of America . I really don ’t know , standing here today.\nSTEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner filing for NPR, freelance. The Fed and your\nfellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what ’s possible for monetary\npolicy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results.\nMeanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade , policy are pursuing their own separate\ncourses. As you and your col leagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever\nconsider the limitations of monetary policy? Should you be more explicit about what monetary\npolicy can and cannot do in this environment?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we try to be clear about that , but, really, I think our job is\nto use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know , to do the jobs that Congress has assigned\nus, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices. That ’s our real job.\nIn terms of giving the fiscal authorities —who , by the w ay, are the ones who created us—\nadvice about how to do their job, you know, we kee p that at a high level, I think. A nd, at a high\nlevel, yes, I would say, and I ’ve said before, that it ’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful\nand that has muc h more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the\nlonger -run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force\n\nparticipation and the skills and aptitudes of workers. All of that comes from the private sect or,\nbut also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy.\nOver the long run, we can’ t really affect the growth rate of the United States . The\npotential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy. It ’s a function of\nother things. So I —I try to be clear about that , and so —but , ultimately, fiscal —fiscal authorities\nwill do what they seem —deem appropriate.\nSAMIRA HUSSAIN. Samira Hussain, BBC News. Mr. Trump has been a very vocal\ncritic of you and your col leagues, recently calling you “ boneheads ” and just now has called you a\n“terrible communicator. ” How do you respond to these criticisms ? And any regrets to have this\nmany press conferences?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don ’t. I’m not going to change my practice her e today of not\nresponding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials. I will just say that I\ncontinue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has\nserved the public well over time. A nd I assu re you that my colleagues and I will continue to\nconduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations. We ’re going to use our best\njudgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that ’s what I\nhave to say on it.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. Thanks\nfor taking my question. As we saw with falling yields , at least up until the beginning of this\nmonth, there ’s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was partly maybe to\nblame for the liquidity crunch in repo markets that we saw this week. I mean, does the F ed have\nconcerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt ? Is that a conversation that you also\n\nhave with Treasury S ecretary Mnuchin —about wha t the proper way to maybe address some of\nthe challenges down the road with that type of , kind of , heavy interest globally?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not really, no. That’s really —that ’s really Treasury ’s job and\nCongress ’s job, in terms of, well, there ’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are , and\nthen there ’s how to finance it. And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from t he Fed.\nWe take—we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work. Now, that doesn’ t stop\nus, from time to tim e, from saying that we think it ’s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return\nto a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it ’s not. That ’s been the case for a long time,\nand that ’s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is\nstrong. So we limit ourselves to high- level statements like that.\nHEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post . Mr. Chairman, in your\nview, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe and\nJapan and other parts of the world? Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or\nany risk to the global economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, so I guess I would say it this way. Global capital markets are\nhighly integ rated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by\nthe very, very low rates that are abroad. And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this :\nthat low rates abroad are a symbol —or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, e xpectations of low\ninflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas\nabout how to break out of that low equilibrium. Now, that has implications for us. You know,\nwe—in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the\nU.S. economy. So that ’s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten\nbecause of that. And so I think we put all —all of that goes into our thinking and into our\n\nmodels. We do understand how the —you know, how the international sector interfaces with the\nU.S. economy. We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy. Thank you very\nmuch."
