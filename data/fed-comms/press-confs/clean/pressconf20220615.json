  "text": "June 15, 2022\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message : We at\nthe Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing . We are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools\nwe need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families\nand businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a\nhalf years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have\na sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and\nprice stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee\nraised its policy inter est rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that\nrate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the\nsize of our balance sheet. I ’ll have more to say about today’s monetary polic y actions after\nbriefly reviewing economic developments.\nOverall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in\ninventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent\nindicators suggest tha t real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending\nremaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and\nactivity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The\ntightening in financial conditions that we ’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper\ngrowth and help bring demand into better balance with supply. As shown in our Summary of\n\nEconomic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic\nactivity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024.\nThe labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a\n50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three\nmonths, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been\nwidespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. FOMC participants\nexpect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to co me into better balance, easing the\nupward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to\n4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections.\nInflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in April, total PCE prices rose 6. 3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core prices rose 4.9 perc ent. In May, the 12- month change in the c onsumer price\nindex came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent .\nAggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is\nboosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.\nAnd COVID- related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbat e supply chain disruptions.\nFOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total\n\nPCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices. The median projection is\n5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024. P articipants\ncontinue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and tra nsportation. We are highly attentive to the risks\nhigh inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective .\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been\nadapting, and it will continue to do so. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point , resulting in a 1½ percentage point\nincrease in the target range so far this year. The Commi ttee reiterated that it anticipates that\nongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet —which plays an important role in firming the\nstance of monetary policy.\nComing out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a\n½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectati ons. We also stated that we were highly\nattentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations h ave risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up\nnotably. In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the\n\ntarget range was warranted at today’s meeting. This continues our approach of expediti ously\nmoving our policy rate up to more normal levels. And it will help ensure that longer -term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs shown in the SEP, t he median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds\nrate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage point s higher than projected in March\nand 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer -run value . The median\nprojection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024,\nstill above the median longer -run value . Of course, these projections do not represent a\nCommittee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a\nyear or more from now.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases\nwill be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually\nlarge one , and I do not expect moves of this size to be common . From the perspective of today,\neither a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most like ly at our next meeting . We\nwill, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, a nd we will continue to communicate\nour thinking as clearly as we can . Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal and to kee p longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past ye ar, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be\nnimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid\n\nadding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are\nhighly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price\nstability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary\npolicy.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you. And I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Two related\nquestions . Chair Powell , do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the\nlast press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July ? And would you please give us as\ndetailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly\non Monday?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we\ncan about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook,\nbecause we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how\npolicy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it ’s helpful\nto provide even more clarity than usual —again , subject to uncertainty in the outlook. And I\nthink over the course of this year , financial markets have responded and have , generally, shown\nthat they understand the path we ’re laying out. Of course , it remains data dependent .\n\nAnd so that ’s what we generally think about guidance , and that ’s why we offer it. And ,\nof course , when we offered that —when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that\nit was subject to the economy performing about i n line with expectations. I also said that if the\neconomy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even\nmore ag gressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last\nweek, and we thought for a while , and we thought , well , this is the appropriate thing to do. So\nthen the question is, what do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is , that ’s not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go\nahead , and so we did. And that ’s really —that ’s really how we made the decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek with the New\nYork Times. You —I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you’re deciding\nhow aggressive you need to be. So , obviously, 75 today. W hat did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn’ t\nhave , and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you take a step back, what we ’re looking for is\ncompelling evidence that inflationary pressur es are abating and that inflation is moving back\ndown. A nd we ’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings —\nthat’s what we ’re looking for. And , by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear\nsigns of at least inflation flattening out and , ideally , beginning to decline. We’ve said that we ’d\nbe data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks —the things tha t I\nmentioned to Howard moments ago.\nSo contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside . Indicators —some\nindicators of inflation expectations have risen , and projections of [inflation] this year have\n\nmoved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting , and today we\ndelivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike , as I mentioned. So the point of it, really ,\nis this : We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels , and over the course of\nthe seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we ’ve seen financial\nconditions tighten, and appropriately so. But the federal f unds r ate, even after this move, is at\n1.6 percent . So, again , the Committee is moving rates up exped itiously to more normal levels ,\nand we came to the view that we’ d like to do a little more front- end loading on that. So I think\nthat the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This\nwas really about the speed in which we would get there. So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points\ntoday—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. T hat would\nput us , at the end of the July meeting , in that range —in that more normal range , and that ’s a\ndesirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with\nwhich you would proceed going forward.\nJust talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee\nparticipants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted —restrictive level at the end\nof this year . And that ’s six months from now , and so much data [can accrue] and so much can\nhappen, s o remember how highly uncertain this is . But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3 ½\npercent. Tha t’s where people are, and that ’s what they want to see, knowing what they know\nnow and understanding that we need to be —we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in\nresponding] to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don ’t need to do t hat much,\nand if they’ re not , then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be\nvery data dependent. Then you’ re looking at next year , and what you’ re seeing is, people see\nmore —a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent. And that ’s generally what\n\npeople see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and\ngetting back down to 2 percent. So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this\nmeeting , and that ’s what we did.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC . Thank you for taking my question, Mr.\nChairman. You have not used the phrase in a long time “ monetary policy is in a good place,”\nwhich is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is\nnow, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that ’s a level that is going\nto be sufficie ntly high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a\nfollow -up, could you break that apart for me? How much of that is restrictive , and how much of\nthat is a normal positive rate that ought to be e mbedded or not , in your opinion, in the funds rate?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So the question really is , how high does the rate really need to\ngo? And this is —the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3 ½ to 4 percent. And how\ndo you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer -run neutral rate, you can compare\nit to that, and we think that ’s in the mid -2s. You can look, frankly, at broader financial\nconditions. You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they ’re having on the\neconomy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that. You can also look\nat the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real ra tes are positive. That ’s not true at the short end . At the short end of the\nyield curve in the early years, you don’ t have real —you have negative rates still.\n\nSo that really is one data point —it’s one part of financial conditions. So I think—I have\nto look at it this way: We move the policy rat e. That affects financial conditions . And that\naffects the economy. We have , of course , ways —rigorous ways to think about it, but , ultimately ,\nit comes down to , do we think financial conditions are in a place w here they ’re having the\ndesired effect on the economy? And that desired affect is , we’d like to see demand moderating.\nDemand is very hot still in the economy. W e’d like to see the labor market getting better in\nbalance between supply and demand , and that can happen [as a result of developments coming]\nboth from supply and demand. Right now , there ’s—demand is substantially higher than\navailable supply , though, so we feel that there ’s a role for us in moderating demand. Those are\nthe things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can’ t affect, and those\nwould be , you know, the things —the commodity price issues that we ’re having around the world\ndue to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the suppl y-side things that\nare still pushing upward on inflation. So that ’s really how I think —how I think about it.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done? Does it get the job done\non breaking the back of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it ’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we ’ll\nknow when we get there really. I mean , honestly, though, that would be —you would have\npositive real rates , I think , and inflation coming down by then. I think you’ d have positive real\nrates across the [yield] curve . I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would\nthink it would, but you know what ? We’re going to find that out empirically . We’re not going\nto be completely model driven about thi s. We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes\nopen, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what ’s happening in the\neconomy.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks . Nick Timiraos. Chair Powell, you’ ve said that you like\nyour policy to work through expectations . And now , obviously, this decision was something\nquite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during\nthe intermeeting period. And I know you just said that wha t changed was really the inflation\ndata—the inflation expectations data . But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was\nthere something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing somethi ng so different from what you had “socialized ” before?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations —so you’ ve\ngot the public, you’ ve got surveys of the public and of experts , and you’ ve also got market based.\nAnd I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short -term inflation is going to be high but comes\ndown sharply over the next couple of years. And that ’s really where inflation expectations are.\nAnd also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent. And so this\nis really very important to us —that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most\nmeasures, most of the time, that ’s what you see. If we even see a couple of indicators that bring\nthat into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously. So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it ’s a preliminary reading ; it might be\nrevised —nonetheless, it was quite eye- catching, and we noticed that. We also noticed that the\nindex of c ommon i nflation e xpectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a\nlong time, so we ’re watching t hat, and we ’re thinking, “t his is something we need to take\nseriously.” And that is one of the factors , as I mentioned—o ne of the factors in our deciding to\nmove ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We ’re\n\nabsolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent. That was one of the reasons —the\nother was just the CPI r eading.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick- up in\ninflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next\nmeeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ re going to —I’ll just say , we’re going to react to the incoming\ndata and appropriate ly, I think. So I wouldn’ t want to put a number on what that might be. The\nmain thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we ’ll be in an area where we’ re—I think as\nyou get closer to the end of the year, you’ re in a range where you’ ve got restrictive policy, which\nis appropriate . Forty- year highs in inflation —we think th at policy is going to need t o be\nrestrictive, and we don’ t know how restrictive. So I think that ’s how we ’ll take it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi , Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios . Thanks for taking our\nquestions. The late -breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points —do you worry that that\nwill make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future ? And should we think of that as a\nkind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll o ver?\nCHAIR POWELL. To take your second question first, yes . I mean , I think we ’re—\nagain, we ’re going, we ’re resolved to take this on , but we ’re going to be flexible in the\nimplementation of it. Sorry —and your [first] question was [about] guidance. So, again, the\noverall exercise is that we try to be —provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we\ncan, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. There’ s always a trade off,\nbecause you have to live with that guidance , and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I ,\n\nfrankly , think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work. With us having really\njust done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite\nsignificantly through the expectations channel, as we ’ve made it clear what our plans are. So I\nthink that ’s been a very healthy thing to be happening. A nd I would hope that our —it’s always\ngoing to be —any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things w orking out\nabout as we expect. And , in this particular situation, you know, we ’re looking for something\nspecific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. W e want to see —inflation\ncan’t go down until it flattens out , and that ’s what we ’re looking to see. And if we don’ t see that,\nthen that ’s the kind of thing that will —even if we don’ t see progress for a longer period, that\ncould cause us to react. But we will . Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some\npoint. And w e’ll react [as] appropriate to that , too. But I would like to think, though , that our\nguidance is still credible , but it ’s always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an\nunusual situation, to get , you know, some data late in , during blackout, pretty close to —very\nclose to our meeting. Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome . So\nI’ve only seen—in my 10 -years -plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even\nclose to that, one or two times. So I don’ t think it’ s something that ’ll come up a great deal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with the\nFinancial Times. On the “ clear and convincing” threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the\nlevel of realized inflation that meets that criteria ? And how is the Committee thinking about the\npotential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what ’s forecasted in the SEP if\ninflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. The second par t I didn’t get.\n\nCOLBY SMITH. W hat’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even\nwhat ’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating a t an acceptable pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right . So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly\nreadings for inflation, and we ’d like to see inflation headed down. B ut, you know —and right\nnow, our policy rate is well below neutral, right? So, soon enough, we ’ll have our policy rate —\nlet’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says: T he policy rate will be up where we\nthink it should be . And then the question would be : Do you slow dow n? Does it make you —\nyou’ll be making these judgments about , is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25,\nlet’s say —or speed up? So that ’s the kind of thinking we ’ll be doing, and , again, we ’re\nlooking—ultimately , we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see\nconvincing evidence, compelling ev idence , that inflation is coming down. A nd that ’s what I\nmean by—that ’s what it would take for us to say, “O kay, we think this job is done.” Because we\nsaw—and, frankly, we saw last year —inflation came down over the course of the summer and\nthen turned right around and went back up. So I think we ’re going to be careful about declaring\nvictory. But our —again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and s ensitive to\nincoming data.\nCOLBY SMITH. Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’ s going to\nrequire more than just some pain at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I think that —I do think that our objective , and this is what ’s\nreflected in the SEP, but our objective , really , is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the\nlabor market remains strong. I think that what ’s becoming more clear is that many factors that\nwe don’ t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that ’s possible or\nnot. And there I ’m thinking , of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain\n\n[developments] , things like that , where we really —the monetary polic y stance doesn ’t affect\nthose things . But having said that, there is a path for us to get there —it’s not getting easier ; it’s\ngetting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand\ndown, and you have a lot of surplus demand. T ake, for example , in the labor market. So you\nhave two job vacancies, essentially , for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a\nreal imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more\nnormal level , and you wouldn’ t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back\ndown to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’ s consistent with 2 percent infla tion. So that ’s a possibility . And you could say the\nsame thing about some of the product markets where there ’s just excess capacity and really\nwhere the strong demand has gone into—sorry , where they ’re capacity constrained, right? So\nyou have , effectiv ely, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it . So demand\ncomes in , and it’s very strong , and it shows up in higher prices —not higher quantities, not more\ncars, because they can ’t make the cars because they don ’t have the semiconductors. So in\nprinciple , that could work in reverse . When demand comes down, you could see —and it ’s not\nguaranteed —but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships\nthat you see in the textbooks would suggest , because of the unusual situation we ’re in on the\nsupply side. So there ’s a pathway there. It is not going to be easy, and there —again , it’s our\nobjective , but, as I mentioned, it ’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’ t control.\nMICHELLE SMI TH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. T hank you for taking our questions. Rachel\nSiegel from the Washington Post. So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking\nup through 2024. I s a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to co mbat inflation? And\n\nwhat is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control\ninflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’ re right . In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to\n4 point —the me dian is 4.1 percent —of course , [there is] a range of actual forecasts. And I\nwould characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know , on its way down to 2\npercent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that ’s still a historically low level.\nWe hadn ’t seen —we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years\nago for —we ’d seen it for , like , one year in the last 50. So the idea that —3.6 percent is\nhistorically low in the last century. So a 4.1 percent unemployment ra te with inflation well on its\nway to 2 percent —I think that would be —I think that would be a successful outcome. So we ’re\nnot looking to have a higher unemployment rate . But I would say that I would certainly look at\nthat as a successful outcome.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Would that include people losing their jobs?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ re not —again, we ’re not, we don’ t seek to put people out of\nwork, of course . We never think , “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have\njobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without\nprice stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market , and that ’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases— maybe the\nworkers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were\nbefore the pandemic —where participation is high, where there ’s lots of job opportunities, where\nit’s just a really —I mean , the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that ’s what we\nwant to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows. We’ d love\nto get back to that place. But, to get there —it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation\n\nwe have. So w e have to restore that , and it really is in service , in the medium and longer term , of\nthe kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi , Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So , as\nyou just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the\nunemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years , and it removed a line from its\npolicy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens pol icy.\nYou just mentioned that that is still your objective , though, so I ’m wondering if you could\nexplain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the F OMC is\ntrying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down.\nCHAIR POWEL L. Not trying to induce a recession now. Let ’s be clear about that.\nWe’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market. That ’s what\nwe’re trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly , it’s our goal to bring about\n2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right? And that ’s kind of what the\nSEP says . The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with\nunemployment at 4.1 percent. A nd this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market.\nAnd, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more\nchallenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from\nthe war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer , industrial\nchemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer\nlasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy , effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong\nlabor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. I t just didn ’t—the\n\nsentence isn ’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this. And that ’s\nnot—that just didn ’t seem appropriate , so we took the sentence out.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. And given the new projections for the unemployment rate,\ncould you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against , say, a month\nago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply- side\nissues get worked out? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , yeah, I think you’ ve seen —ag ain, we ’ve been expecting\nprogress , and we didn’ t get that. W e got sort of the opposite . So I also think the situation,\nreally —since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you ’re\nseeing is the situation getting more difficul t. And you look around the world—I mean , lots of\ncountries are —lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it ’s largely due to\ncommodities prices. But all over the world , you’ re seeing these e ffects. And so—and we ’re\nseeing them here: g as prices at all-time highs , and things like that . That’s not something we can\ndo something about. So that is really —and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is\nimportant for expectations. People —the public ’s expectations, why would they be\ndistinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we [on\nthe Committee] think a bout because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline\ninflation is what people experience . They don’ t know what core is. Why would they? They\nhave no reason to. So that ’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflat ion.\nSo it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five\nmonths , and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today. Hence our resolution to\nget rates up and, ultimately , get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks , Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.\nI want ed to ask you—you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that retail sales surprised the\nmarket by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down. Are you hearing from\ncontacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re, of course , watching very, very carefully for that and\nlooking at the retail— the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. A nd so I —but I think the\nfair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong. The consumer ’s in really good\nshape financial ly. T hey’re spending. There ’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the\neconomy. People are talking about it a lot —consumer confidence is very low. That ’s probably\nrelated to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people. But that’ s what\nwe’re seeing. We’ re not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it ’s still at\nquite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels —healthy growth\nlevels.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So then as you are raising rates in thi s economy, how closely\nare you watching consumer spending, or is there something —another indicator that you ’re\nwatching more closely?\nCHAIR POWELL. It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we\nwatch consumer spending, but we watch everythi ng. We watch business fixed investment,\nwhich actually has softened a bit . And we watch —we ’re responsible for watching everything .\nConsumption is 60- some percent of the economy, two -thirds of the economy, so, naturally , we\nspend a lot of time on that. And , again, there ’s a lot going on —there are a lot of flows back and\n\nforth —but , ultimately , it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well\npositioned to deal with higher interest rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Michael McKee from Bloomberg\nRadio and Television. Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? In other\nwords, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? If that ’s going to be the\ncomponent that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate\nis holding steady or starting to go down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the —we ’re responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation\nmeans headline i nflation. So that ’s our ultimate goal. We, of course, like all central b anks do,\nlook very, very carefully at core inflation because it is —it’s a much better predictor , and it ’s\nmuch—it ’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going , and it ’s also more relevant to our\ntools. As I mentioned, the parts that don’ t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tool s,\nso we look at that. But it ’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I\nmentioned about expectations . We can ’t affect, really —I mean , the energy prices are set by\nglobal commodity prices . And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty\nheavily influenced by global commodity prices , too. Also other things. So we can ’t really have\nmuch of an effect . But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations\n[coming] from headline [inflation readings] . So it’ s a very difficult situation to be in , and we —\nagain, we can ’t do much about the difference between [h eadline and core inflation rates due to]\nthe elements that make up headline that are not in core.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Could I just, as a follow -up, get a clarification on the SEP ? When\nthe members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record ? Were they revised\n\nafter the CPI or Michigan numbers came out? In other words, does the SEP , as we have it now ,\nreflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move?\nCHAIR POWELL. The SEP is of one piece . It reflects all of the economic readings . It\nalso reflects the 75 basis point increase. This is important. So people had that in hand when\nthey—when their SEPs were submitted. So it ’s—in other words, it ’s not in addition to what ’s in\nthe SEP. T he SEP—everyone ’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’ s\ngoing forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico. I wanted to ask about how\nyou’re measuring progress, especially since you’ ve now started front -loading rate hik es more.\nYou’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports , and I\nguess I ’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you\nmight be concerned that it ’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that ,\nas you’ ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects . And I guess my question is,\ndo you think that inflation will tell you —inflation data will tell you when you’ ve gone to where\nyou need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it ’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is\nto say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? A nd we ’ll be able to see—th e\nareas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand , and we ’ll be able to see our\neffect on , for example, job openings in real time. And that would tell us what ’s—that would tell\nus about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we ’re seeing , but,\ngoing forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector . Sorry, I ’m not\nsure I ’m getting to your question.\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. My question is, is inflation data itself the best ind icator for when\nyou’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?\nCHAIR POWELL. There ’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and\nit’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not —maybe it ’ll be really clear . But\nwe’re—and we ’re quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say , the worst mistake we could make\nwould be to fail, which —it’ s not an option. We have to restore price stability . We really do,\nbecause everything —it’s the bedrock of the economy. If you don’ t have price stability, the\neconomy’ s really not going to work the way it ’s supposed to. It won ’t work for people —their\nwages will be eaten up. So we want to get the job done. This inflation happened relatively\nrecently . We don’ t think that it’ s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We\ndon’t think that we ’re seeing a wage –price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as\nvery likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent , and that ’s critical. It ’s\nabsolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. So that ’s how we ’re thinking\nabout it.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I just want to expand, I\nguess , on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done.\nYou talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession\njust broadly being dinner table talk. Does the general feel among American households and also\nbusinesses square with your e xplanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in\nthe statement didn ’t change between May and June? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, clearly , people don’ t like inflation —a lot. And many people are\nexperiencing it , really , for the first time , because we haven ’t had anything like this kind of\ninflation in 40 years . And it’s really something people don’ t like . And they’ re experiencing that ,\n\nand that ’s showing up in their —in surveys and in all kinds of ways. And we understa nd that , and\nwe understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we ’re\ndetermined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So that ’s really what we ’re saying.\nWe’re not —I’m not —clearly , it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it ’s very painful for people.\nI guess what I ’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing\nour job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use\nthem and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time , we think,\nto get inflation back down, but we will do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. You have\ntalked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns . But aside from\nrises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’ re also seeing stickier measures of inflation\nincreasing , such as the Cleveland Fed ’s median and trimmed mean CPIs. I mean , how persistent\ndo you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see those going in the near future ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned , I think , in my opening statement, inflation has\nstarted —it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic -related areas , and it ’s spread now\nbroadly across the economy and into the services sector as well . It was really in the goods sector\nat the beginning. And , particularly , you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ ve flown on a pl ane\nlately —planes are very full , and plane tickets are very expensive. S ome of that will be pass-\nthrough of energy prices , but it ’s—so you’ re experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is\nhigh. S o the question— and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other\nmeasures are going up. So it’s a time when we’ re not seeing progress and we want to see\n\nprogress , and that ’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks\nlike it does . We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would\nbe, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year -end.\nAnd then after that , you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that ’s responsive t o your\nquestion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with\nMarketplace. Do you still think a softish landing is possible , and how would you define that at\nthis point considering the revised projections f or unemployment, GDP, inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think what ’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test. If you\nsee—you’ re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the\nunemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent . That would be —I would call that as meeting\nthat test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there ’s—I think there ’s—I don’ t want\nto be the handicapper here . I just— that is our objective , and I do think it ’s possible. Like I said ,\nthough, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created\ngreat challenges. A nd, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it —there ’s a much\nbigger chance now that it ’ll depend on factors that we don’ t cont rol, which is , fluctuations and\nspikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don’ t\nknow, but we ’re focused on —very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent,\nwhich we think is essential for the b enefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a\nsustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\n\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I was\nwondering if you could talk a little bit more —economists are worried that you ’re kind of hitting\nthe economy with a sledgehammer and that now there ’s even more risk of a recession than a\n50–50 path of rates. So could you talk a little bit more about that ? And what evidence would get\nyou to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure . So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over\nthe last seven months, and that ’s a good thing, we think. But the f ederal f unds r ate, even after\nthis increase , is at 1.6 percent. So it ’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate . And even if we\ndid another —so we ’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s\nprobably. Still, that’ s still a low rate. So that ’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession\non. And we ’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned a couple times,\nthe Committee ’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to\n3½ percent range by the end of this yea r, but that ’s conditioned on that being the appropriate\nthing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it ’ll be reflected in our policy , as you\nsee today. We’ll be watching— if things go in a direction we don’ t expect, then we’ re going to\nadapt. And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment —extraordinarily uncertain\nenvironment. So, again, we ’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser, Market News International . Thank you, Chair Powell. I\nwas wondering if the F ed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last\ntwo years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public? And then, secondly,\ngiven the illiquidity and the extraordinar y volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that\nQT will make that worse?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, what was your question on QT?\nEVAN RYSER. Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial\nmarkets, whether QT will make things wo rse.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course , we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why\ninflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent. We—\nit’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question mornin g, noon, and night.\nBut you have to understand the context . For—really , the context is this : For decades before the\npandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let ’s call it that, globalization\nenabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. So and that ’s how all the models work is ,\ndecades and decades of data—they look at that . It’s a very flat Philips curve wor ld, and the\nsupply shocks tend to be transient , right ? So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of\nshocks , if you think about it : the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by\nthe war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China —the war in Ukraine potentially having\neffects for years here. So we ’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy —we\nhave been , obviously, for quite a while . But this is a different —these forces are different.\nInflation is behaving dif ferently , and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong\ndemand. B ut you couldn ’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which\nis there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that. So that ’s how we ’re looking at it.\nAnd we ’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about , what all that means.\nYou don’ t—the thing is , you don’ t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going\nto be sustained ? In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the\n\nold world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on? The\nhistory is , you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’ 70s, and then they go away,\nand sort of there ’s a “new normal ,” and things settle down. But , honestly, we don’ t know what\nthat’s going to be. In the meantime , we have to find price stability in this new world and\nmaximum employment in this new world where , clearly , inflationary forces are —you ’re seeing\nthem everywhere. Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it ’s\nabsolutely extraordi nary. It’ s not just here. In fact, we ’re sort of in the middle of the pack,\nalthough I think we have , of course , a different kind of inflation than other people have , partly\nbecause our economy is stronger and more highly recover ed. So that ’s what we ’re doing.\nWe’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we ’ve communicated\nreally clearly to the markets about what we’ re going to do there. Markets seem to be okay with\nit. We ’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quit e a lot, quite a lot from where\nit’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking , and they see this coming. I\nhave no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems . It seems to be kind of understood\nand accepted at this poin t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks . For the last question, we ’ll go to Mark Hamrick.\nMARK HAMRICK. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I wonder what your\nassessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years -long increase in home\nprices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates. And all that , of course, given the heightened\nsensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial\ncrisis over a decade ago. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So rates were very low —a good place to start is that rates were\nvery, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could\n\nto support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unempl oyment rate\nwas well higher than that. A nd that was a —rates a re low , and now they’ re coming back up to\nmore normal , or above , levels. So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was\nreally high, obviously demand for housing changed from wa nting to live in urban areas to some\nextent to living in single -family homes in the suburbs, famously. A nd so the demand was just\nsuddenly much higher. And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of\nyears. So that changes now , and rates have moved up—we ’re well aware that mortgage rates\nhave moved up a lot —and you’ re seeing a changing housing market. We ’re watching it to see\nwhat will happen. How much will it really affect residential investment? Not really sure. How\nmuch will it affect housing prices? Not really sure . It’s—I mean, obviously, we ’re watching\nthat quite carefully. You would think over time —I mean , so there ’s a tremendous amount of\nsupply in the housing market of unfinished homes , and as those come on line—whereas the\nsupply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale , is incredibly low,\nhistorically low. So it ’s still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while even\nin a world where rates ar e up. S o it’s a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I\nwould say if you’ re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need\na bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and\nwhere inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again. S o this will be a process\nwhereby we —ideally , we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place\nand housing availability and credit availability are at appropriat e levels.\nSo thank you very much."
