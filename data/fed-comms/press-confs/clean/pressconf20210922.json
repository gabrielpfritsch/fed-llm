  "text": "September 22, 2021\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along w ith our strong guidance on interest\nrates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete.\nProgress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing\nstrong support to the recovery. I ndicators of economic activity and employment have continued\nto strengthen. Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth\nis widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half. The sectors most adversely\naffected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID -19 cases has\nslowed their recovery. Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of\nthe year but flattened out in J uly and August as spending softened in COVID -sensitive sectors,\nsuch as travel and restaurants.\nAdditionally, in some industries, near -term supply constraints are restraining activity.\nThese constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle indust ry, where the worldwide\nshortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, f orecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year\nhave been revised somewhat lower s ince o ur June Summary of Economic Projections , but\nparticipants still foresee rapid growth.\n\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove. Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the\npast three months. In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure underst ates the shortfall in\nemployment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.\nFactors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus,\nappear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023\nand ’ 24.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As\nthe economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bot tlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly\nproduction can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer\nlasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants ’ inflation projections for this\nyear. Wh ile these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation\n\nis expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal . The median inflation projection from\nFOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next yea r.\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other\nconstraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than antic ipated, posing upside\nrisks to inflation . Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having\nwell-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to\npromote our broad- based and inclusive maximu m-employment goal. Indicators of longer -term\ninflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer -run inflation goal of 2 percent.\nIf sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.\n\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus , and risks to the\neconomic outlook remain. The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID -19 cases,\nresulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. C ontinued\nprogress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal\neconomic conditions .\nThe Fed ’s policy actions have been guided by our manda te to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and mark et functioning early in the pandemic and since then\nhave helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the\nprogress made toward our goals since the C ommittee adopted its asset purchase guidance last\n\nDecember. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals . If progress\ncontinues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset\npurchases may soon be warrant ed.\nWe also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic\nconditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee ’s guidance. While no decisions were\nmade, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer -term securities will\ncontinue to support accommodative financial conditions.\nThe timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to\ncarry a direct signal regarding the timing of in terest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a\ndifferent and substantially more stringent test. We continue to expect that it will be appropriate\nto maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market\ncondi tions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time. Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year ; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate\nlevel of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022.\nParticipants generally expect a gradual pace of policy fir ming that would leave the level\nof the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer -run level through 2024. Of course, these\nprojections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a yea r or more from now. More important than any forecast is the\n\nfact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum -employment\nand price -stability goals.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHEL LE SMITH. Thank you. W e’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. When it comes to the taper and , eventually, to any rate increases, I ’m wondering if\nyou can walk us through what “ substantial further progress ” looks like , given the latest batch of\nprojections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the\nunemployment rate also being higher than June, as w ell as the change to GDP lower than June.\nIf you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “ substantial further\nprogress ” looks like, that would be great.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the test for beginning our taper is that we ’ve achieved\nsubstantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.\nAnd for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress. So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others. So the question is really on the maximum -employment test. So if you look at a good number of\nindicators, you will see that, since last December , when we articulated the test , and the readings\ntoday, in many cases mo re than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment\nrate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate —50 or 60 percent of that road\nhas been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress.\n\nMany on the Committee feel that the “ substantial further progress ” test for employment\nhas been met. Others feel that it’ s close, but they want to see a little more progress. There ’s a\nrange of perspectives. I guess my own view would be that the test —the “substantial further\nprogress ” test for employment is all but met. And so, once we ’ve met those two tests, once the\nCommittee decides that they ’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting ;\nthat’s the purpose of that language , is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next\nmeeting. The Committee will consider that test, and we ’ll also look at the broader environment\nat that time and make a decision whether to taper.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Howard Schneider.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. So , looking at the\nSEPs , we got now basically four years of inflation above target , and policy never gets to the\nlong- run rate. I ’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives : one, within the\nnew framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average\nhousehold that ’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four\nyears running when, for some this year, real wages h ave actually gone down.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So , as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit\nin the outyears. And that ’s really , I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly\nfor this year. And that ’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that\nare being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way\nyet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into\nnext year. So that suggests that inflation ’s going to be higher this year , and a number —I guess\nthe inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths. Why—th ose are very modest overshoot s. You ’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years\n\nand three years out. These are very, very —I don ’t think that households are going to, you know,\nnotice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be peopl e’s forecasts.\nYou know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation\naveraging 2 percent over time, and I think we ’re very much on track to achieve those things. In\nterms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation\nexpectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want, we’ re—that’s really the ultimate test\nof whether we ’re getting this done under the framework. And, you know, we do want inflation\nto run moderately above 2 percen t. I wouldn’ t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent\nin 2023 and ’24—one -tenth in ’24. But you’ re right, those are the numbers.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Colby Smith.\nCOLBY SMITH. Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, you mentioned\nongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I ’m wondering what the contours of that\ndebate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining\noptionality for a 2022 interest rate increa se? Or is it about financial stability risks? Or concerns\nabout the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say that there ’s very broad support on the Committee for\nthis plan, both as t o the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote\ntoday, and I ’d say quite broad support for this approach. You ’re correct that there are some who\nwould prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ ve made their arguments publicly. For some of\nthem , it’s a financial stability concern. And for others , it’s other concerns. They can make their\nown arguments. This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us\nhaving completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.\n\nYou know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the —in the\nearly stages of the crisis . They were essential in restoring market function in the T reasury and\nother markets. Then , as th e recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will\ndo. And now we ’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it ’s time for us to begin to taper\nthem. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.\nAnd, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really\nwhere the framework —the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that so rt\nof thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go. And, again, broad support on the\nCommittee.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Nick Timiraos.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you\nhave said t he test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near- term\nprojections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff , and not just\na taper , may be closer at hand. Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about\nthe threshold for liftoff that you ’ve articulated? Or do they believe that either inflation or\neconomic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the\ntest for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months in everyone ’s figuring. So you’ re\ngoing to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it ’s what we adopted last September. It ’s labor market conditions\nconsistent with maximum employment. And while we have interesting signs that , in many ways ,\nthe labor market’ s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that\nthose imbalances will sort themself out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it,\n\nmoderately higher inflation over 2 percent —you know, that really depends on the path of\ninflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met\nthat test by the time we reach liftoff.\nSo I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year -end 2022 numbers,\nsome people are writing down very low unemployment rates . And that ’s only one indicator , but\nit suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they’ re writing down in good faith what they\nsee as meeting the test. There ’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but —\nby the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023. So it ’s not really an\nunusually wide array of views about this.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ ll go to Jeanna Sm ialek.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell —thank you for taking our questions. Prior to\nrecent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents\nKaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year? And I wonder if you thought those were\nappropriate .\nCHAIR POWELL. So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were do ing. So\nlet me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the\nAmerican people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that ’s why I\ndirected the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial\nholdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are , in many respects, the same as those for\ngovernment agencies , plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our\nbusiness.\n\nOne of thos e is—sort of , three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures.\nOne is , ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that ’s bank securities and other things.\nSecondly, there are times when we ’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell\nfinancial assets. And that ’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting. And,\nthird, there ’s regular disclosure. So all of these —everyone ’s, you know, ownership and\nactivities ar e all disclosed on an annual basis.\nSo, you know, I would have had to go back and read people ’s financial disclosures to\nknow what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess\nyou’d say it ’s served us well. The o ther thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not\nadequate to the task of really sustaining the public ’s trust in us. We need to make changes, and\nwe’re going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and\ncomprehensive r eview. We’ re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten\nour rules and standards.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We’ ll go to Steve Liesm an.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on\nJeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades . Do you think it ’s\nappropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you ’re looking at? And in that these —you said\nyourself, they’ re clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed ’s code of conduct says Fed\nofficials should avoid even the appearance of the , of conflict, do those tr ades, in fact —and\nholdings —violate the Fed ’s code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you\nmight get— be done with your review? Thank you, sir.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Don ’t have a timeline yet ; we can start with that. So, well, let me\naddress the muni question, since that ’s in there. You know, I personally owned municipal\nsecurities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that. Meaning I —they’re no— I’m holding\nall those securities, my wife and I, to maturity. And munis were always thought to be a pretty\nsafe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never\nbuy municipal securities. So it was not an uncommon thing.\nAnd so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, a nd I did\nit without hesitating. And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal\nfinancial market, were very much on the verge of collapse. And it was time to go, and we did. But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and—who looked carefully at it and\nsaid that I didn ’t have a conflict. So that ’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.\nSecondly, you’ re right, though, as —we ’re going to be looking at all those things. I don ’t\nwant to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes. But this, again,\ncomprehensive and deliberate process—we ’re going to make changes. I want to be able to look\nback on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this c hallenge and handled the\nsituation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public ’s interest and\nthe institution that we ’re all a part of.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I’m sorry, Chair Powell —I just want to follow up. You said I was\nright. When you said “ right ,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials\nshould not own the same assets they ’re buying? Is that —\nCHAIR POWELL. I think that’ s a reasonable thing. Yeah, and, of course, for the most\npart, we don ’t. I mean, it wa s a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis. They were\nbought many years ago, actually. And so we started buying munis as part of the M unicipal\n\nLiquidity F acility. So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event. And I couldn’ t sell\nthem, so what I did was , I just held them, checked with the ethics people , and went ahead. So,\nbut as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Thank you. T hank you, Chair Powell. Wider question\nabout jobs and the Fed ’s schedule —the Fed ’s policy framework that you laid out here. You and\nother Fed officials have often talked ab out expecting a job market pickup in September as more\nchildren return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating. You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring. There ’s some real -time data suggesting that\nwe may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply. So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports? And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect\nyour plans? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , you’ re right, we have a —really , I’ll call it a unique situation\nwhere , by many measures , the labor market is tight. And 11 million job openings, very\nwidespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it ’s quite difficult to hire people,\nwages moving up, and that kind—s o, quite a tight labor market. So our view, I think —\nwidespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including th e expiration of unemployment —extra unemployment benefits, and other things\nwould come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we ’d get out of this strange\nworld where there ’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor\nshortage.\n\nAnd so what happened was , Delta happened. And you had this very sharp spike in Delta\ncases. And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time\nor when they’ re always at a threat of being closed because o f Delta, the Delta variant, you know,\nyou might want to wait . Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have\nto quit it three weeks later, you’ re going to wait until you ’re confident of that. So some of that\nmay not have happened. Also , people didn’ t, you know —as you know, hiring and spending in\nthese face -to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those\nmonths. So we —so that —really , the big shortfall in labor, in jobs , was largely in travel a nd\nleisure , and that’s because of —clearly because of Delta. So that all happened. And so what\nwe—we know thi ngs that didn’ t happen.\nI think there ’s still —it may just be that it’ s going to take more time. But it still seems\nthat, inexorably, people will —these are people who were largely working back in February of\n2020. They ’ll get back to work when it ’s time to do that. It just may take a longer time. You ’re\nright, though—it didn ’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta.\nIn terms of the —you asked also about the test for November. I think if the economy\ncontinues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall\nsituation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting . Or\nnot, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Well, just a quick —if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what,\nhow much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for Septembe r? And, I mean, is\nit, you know, are you in a data -dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers\ngoing ahead? Or are we at a point where you ’ve accumulated enough progress that —\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is, it’ s accumulated progress. So, you know, for me, it wouldn’ t\ntake a knockout, great, super strong employment report. It would take a reasonably good\nemployment report for me to feel like that test is met. And others on the Committee —many on\nthe Committee feel that the test is already met. Others want to see more progress. And, you\nknow, we ’ll work it out as we go. But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but\nmet. So I don’ t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I ’d like to see a\ngood—a decent employment report. I mean, it ’s not, it ’s, again, it ’s not to be confused with the\ntest for liftoff, which is so much higher.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you. W e’ll go to Victoria Guida.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So I wanted to ask about the V ice C hair of\nSupervision position and just —I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role\nand the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy. And then, just sort of a\nrelated question: As you know, Randy Quarles’ s vice c hairmanship ends next month, a nd I was\nwondering if he ’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he ’s replaced in that role .\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So Dodd- Frank created this position, V ice C hair for\nSupervision, and it ’s, there ’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd -Frank language, as I ’m\nsure you know. And, e ffectively , what it means is that the V ice C hair for S upervision is charged\nwith settin g the regulatory agenda. And, you know, it ’s a specific grant of authority. And in the\n10 years, almost , that I’ ve been at the Fed , that person has really done that. Dan Tarullo\ncertainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well. And I would, I think —I respect that\nauthority. I respect that that’ s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I\nwould accept that.\n\nAnd, furthermore, you know, it ’s fully appropriate to look at —for a new person to come\nin and look at the current s tate of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes,\nand I welcome that. In terms of Vice Chair Quarles ’s term, we ’re not currently in that situation,\nand I actually don’ t have any updates for you on that today. We’ll keep you posted on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive\nmonetary policy framework. In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that\nthey predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the B lack\nunemployment rate is 6.1 percent. And I ’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for\nAfrican Americans is consistent with full employment o r whether it would need to be lower as\npart of your inclusive growth strategy .\nCHAIR POWELL. Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a\nparticular unemployment rate for any particular group. Really , we look at a broad range of —a\nvery broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is. And one of\nthe things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing. So we will do all of that. So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking? So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market. If\nyou look at the last two or three years of , before the pandemic hit, you saw —after a lot of long\nprogress, you saw a really strong labor market. And you saw wages at the low end moving up\nfaster than everywhere else—s omething that ’s great to see.\nWe also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for\nAfrican Americans, for example, and also participation rates. We saw a really, really healthy set\nof dynamics. And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’ t continue. There\n\nwere no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic. We were not —there\nwas nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a\nrecession. So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more\nyears of this. It would have been—so we ’re all quite eager to get back to that.\nWe also said we wouldn ’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment , in the\nabsence of inflation. So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that tha t really benefited\nlabor market participants in a broad and inclusive way. That ’s, of course, not the current\nsituation. We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not\nmoderately above target. So that ’s, really , how we thi nk about it. It isn ’t really just targeting the\nheadline numbers, but it ’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about\nwhat constitutes maximum employment.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up, s hould there be a significant gap bet ween\nBlack unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the\ncontrol of the Fed that other people should be doing something about? Or should that be —\nshould the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you really —I mean, first of all, ideally , there wouldn’ t be any\ngap, of course. We would all love to see no such gap. This is a persistent gap, and it ’s very hard\nto explain based on typical metrics. It’s just, it ’s quite troubling, but it really is —you know, we\nhave, you know, famously broad and blunt tools. I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies —frankly, education policies and t hat kind of thing— are better at focusing on.\nI think we ’ve identified the part that we can do, and we ’ll do that part. But I ’ve always been\nclear that it’ s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.\n\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. —a plan for dealing with a debt default that included\nprioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or ,\nnondefaulted T reasuries and buying those who are —that are. Are any or all of those still on the\ntable? Do you think any of those would work? And what would happen to the economy, in your\nview, should the debt ceiling not be raised?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question. So\nit’s just very important that the debt ceiling be rais ed in a timely fashion so that the United States\ncan pay its bills when and as they come due. That ’s a critically important thing. The failure to\ndo that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to\nthe financia l markets. And it ’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should\ncontemplate. I ’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that. I’m just going to\nsay that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn ’t defaul t on any of its\nobligations —should pay them when and as due. And that, you know, no one should assume that\nthe F ed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure —fully\nprotect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when\nthey’ re due.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Good. If I could follow up, have you discussed options with\nmembers of Congress?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’ t generally ever talk about the conversations I have\nwith elected offic ials or other appointed officials. But, look, you can see that this is a major\nfocus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi—thanks so much. Senato r Warren sent you a letter last week\nurging the F ed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ ungovernable behavior ” from the\nbank. I ’m just curious, under what circumstances would the F ed actually consider revoking a\nfinancial holding company’ s license? And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion,\nwarrant such an action?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’ s efforts to\nfix its widespread and pervasive problems. They represent a serious matter to u s, and the firm is\nrequired to remediate them. And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to\nmeet our expectation. We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an\nunprecedented asset cap that will stay in plac e until the firm has comprehensively fixed its\nproblems. And we ’re not going to remove that asset cap until that ’s done. So bottom line is,\nwe’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or\nviolating laws. But I can ’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any\nindividual bank.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we ’ll go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. You noted earlier in the press\nconference that you weren ’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas F ed Bank\npresidents. As you know , those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the\nrenomination process earlier this year. And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process\nat the time. So I want to know, did anybody know —did anybody at the Board level know about\nthe stock trading activity? And , going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and\nBoston F ed Bank presidents to do their job?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So these, I don’ t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports\nannually. And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020. So I don’ t have any reason to\nthink people at the B oard would have known about particular trading that ’s going on. They wil l\nsee that —there are people at the F ed who see th e, you know, see the trading reports when\nthey’ re, you know, when they’ re annually filed.\nYou know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy,\nno one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. It’ s\nsomething we take very, very seriously. This is an important moment for the F ed, and I ’m\ndetermined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.\nI’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things. And,\nyou know, when we have things to announce, we ’ll go ahead and do that, but that ’s really what I\nhave for today.\nMICHAEL DERBY. One small follow -up. I mean, I know that you didn ’t have the\n2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past -year forms in hand. And at least in the case of,\nlike, the Dallas disclosu re forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past. So that , in\ntheory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that ’s, yeah, that ’s a good question. So, you know, the five -year\nreview that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the F OMC, all of those things.\nAnd if there were a concern —a public concern or a private concern —about something that\nsomeone had done, we wouldn’ t wait for the five -year. We wouldn’ t wait that day if there were\nconcerns.\n\nYou’re right, though, these —as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time,\nand it ’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it ’s a little stricter. And it is that\nyou can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt. You can’ t trade during\nthe FOMC period and du ring the meeting —the blackout period and then during the meeting.\nAnd then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years. So all of these things have\nbeen going —to the extent they ’ve been going on, they’ ve been a matter of public record.\nAnd, you know —but, nonetheless —so that —you know, it was seeming to work just\nokay. And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better .” And we\nwill. But you’ re right, but it has not been part of the process. And, appropriately, I don’ t think it\nshould have been. I mean, I wouldn’ t blame the people who conduct that review. I really think,\nif someone had raised concerns or if we ’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn ’t\nhave been part of that process. It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five\nyears.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the F ed\nwould balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal . Would you hold off on raising rates?\nOr how would you think about that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say one thing . You’re looking for conditions consistent\nwith maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time. So you’ re not\nnecessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point , really, we actually\n\nhave a paragraph in our framework, and something like thi s has been there for a long time. It’s, I\nthink it ’s paragraph six. And you’ re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not\ncomplementary ; they’ re somehow in tension. And if we judge that ’s effect —that is the case,\nwhat it says is , we take i nto account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the\npotentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return\nto levels judged consistent with the mandate.\nSo, we used to call that the balanced -approach paragraph because it had those words. So\nit’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be —pardon me —to be in a situation where\nthe two goals are in tension. And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equit ies between the two. How long will it take , and how big are the gaps , and that\nkind of thing. We don’ t really think we ’re in that —we ’re sort of in that situation, I’ d say, in a\nshort -term way. But we think, we do expect that this is sort of —because of the COVID shock\nand the reopening and all that , you’ re seeing this temporarily.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We’ ll go to Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking\nthe question. So on c orporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we ’ve been watching,\ncould that be —is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that ’s\nout there? In the past you’ve said you’ re watching the level of corporate debt. So is, what ’s\nyour level of concern right now? And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. About the United States, no. Corporate defaults are very low in the\nUnited States right now. Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that\nended with the pandemic. We were very concerned in the last year or so. We were concerned in\n\nthe last year or so, and then I ’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if\nyou’ve got a highly lever aged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things\nhappened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of\ndefaults. It didn’ t happen, potentially —I mean, to a significant extent because of the C ARES\nAct and the response that we undertook and all that. It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we ’ve ever had. And I think for whatever reason now , you have very, very low\ndefault rates now among corporate debt.\nYou know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high\ndebt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had. And the government has been working to get that under control. This is part of that effort.\nThe government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies. And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it ’s something the y’re managing. In terms of the implications\nfor us, there isn ’t, there ’s not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are\nnot tremendously exposed. But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence cha nnels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn’ t draw a parallel to\nthe United States corporate sector.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Just wondering if you could give us an update\non whether or not you’ ve had conversations with the White House about a possible\nreappointment . And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of\nbuilds up. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the phrase goes : “I have nothing for you on that today.”\nSorry. I’m focused on doing my job —\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg Robb.\nCHAIR POWELL. —I ’m focused on doing my job every day for the American people,\nand I don’ t have any comment on that, Brian.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that. Let’s go to Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell. I was wondering\nif, in your discussion about the tapering that —you said that officials think it’ s appropriate to end\naround the middle of the year —if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance\nsheet then . I’ve heard some F ed officials say that they wouldn ’t shrink the balance sheet. Was\nthat discussed? And what ’s your stance on shr inking the balance sheet? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So my thinking on this has been: L et’s get through the taper\ndecision, and then let ’s turn to those issues. There are a number of related issues that —you\nmentioned one, Greg, but , you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we ’ll do\nthat. But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues ,\nrather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues , because we’ re really not.\nAnd, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time. We ’ve watched other\ncountries and what they’ ve done. So I think we ’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fai rly\nexpeditiously when it ’s time . But it’ s just not time yet, in my thinking.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Scott Horsley.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You talked a little bit about inflation\nexpectations. And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists —which are pretty much in line with the FOMC\n\nmembers —and laypeople ’s expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York F ed survey.\nHow much weight do you put on laypeople ’s expectations? And what do you think accounts for\nthat divide?\nCHAIR POWELL. So within —let ’s just take the household surveys generally. The New\nYork F ed su rvey, let me talk about that specifically , and this is from the New York F ed. It’ s\nonly an eight -year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’ re looking three years out.\nAnd it seems like there’ s a high correlation between three -year and one -year. For the most part,\nsurveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the lo nger\nterm. And that ’s also what expectations are showing.\nSo there are many, many different inflation measures, of course. And that ’s why we have\nthis thing called the CIE, which is the, it’ s an index of —it’s market -based measures, i t’s\nprofessional forecasters , and it ’s household surveys. And you just put them all —it’s not, you\nknow, it doesn’ t have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in, and you measure the\nchange. So you should be —and, also , you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of\nthing, so you can look at all that. And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving\nup. Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say , 2013, which was before the really— the drop in inflation expectations\nbroadly happened in ’ 14 and ’ 15—around then. So that’s not a troubling thing.\nBut, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important. We spend a lot of time\nwatching them. And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently\nabove levels that are really consistent with o ur mandate, then, you know, we would certainly\nreact to that. But we don’ t really see that now. We see more of a moderate increase that is—the\n\nfirst part of which is welcome. And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down,\nand it was good to see them get back up a bit. But, again, we watch carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Heather Scott.\nHEATHER SCOTT. Hi. Sorry, you caught me off guard. Thank you, Chair Powell, for\ntaking my question. I really appreciate it. Aga in, on the taper timing. You say it ’s going to last\nto the middle of next year. But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to\ninflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s not my expectation. Of course, we can always—we haven ’t\ndecided to taper yet, and we haven’ t decided the pace yet. So, you know, i t’s not my expectation\nthat we would have to. We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we —if it becomes\nappropriate , though. A bsolutely. In fact, back in ’ 13, when we tapered, we always said we\nweren ’t on a preset course. I think this will b e a shorter period. The economy’ s much farther\nalong than it was when we tapered in 2013. So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen. It ’s\na very gradual taper. It will be when we agree on it. And, but we certainly have the freedom to\neither speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.\nHEATHER SCOTT. But you wouldn’ t expect rate liftoff to happen until you ’re finished\nwith that process?\nCHAIR POWELL. You wouldn’ t, no, because, you know, when you’ re—as long as\nyou’re buying assets, you ’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’ t make any sense to, you\nknow, then lift off. I mean, what you would do is , you’ d speed up the taper, I think, if that were\nthe situation you’ re in. Not—we don’ t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be\nwiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.\n\nHEATHER SCOTT. All right, thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMI TH. Okay, for the last question, we’ll go to Jeff Cox.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. I just wanted to check in\nwith you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the F ed to develop a central bank\ndigital currency . I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications\nthat it’ s going to come this month. But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see\nwhere the F ed’s heading on this , and just wondering if you can provide some update there .\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure, I ’d be glad to. So we think it ’s really important that the c entral\nbank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public ’s benefit. That ’s one of our\njobs. We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the F ed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy\ncurrency and payment system. So there ’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking\nplace outside the regul atory perimeter. And innovation is fantastic. Our economy runs on\ninnovation. But where the public ’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate\nregulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases.\nSo with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency -like\nproducts, we ’re workin g proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what\nform. We have two broad workstreams , one of which is really technology, both at the B oard and\nin the scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues. As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement —\nengagement with many different groups, including elected officials , around these issues. We\n\nthink it ’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for\nmaking an informed decision.\nThe ultimate test we’ll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other\ndigital innovat ions is : Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?\nWe’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for\ninstant payments in the U.S. It’ll be the first such major expansion of our co re payment system\nsince the 1970s. We found the case for this quite compelling —for consumers, businesses , and\njust ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system. So, bottom line,\nwe haven ’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in\norder to form the basis of this public interaction that we ’ll have. Thank you very much.\nJEFF COX. If I could have a quick —could I get a quick follow on that? Thank you. I\nwas just wondering if —okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global\nrace for digital currenc ies?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it ’s important that we get to a place where we can make an\ninformed decision about this and do so expeditiously. I don’ t think we ’re be hind. I think it ’s\nmore important to do this right than to do it fast. We are the world ’s reserve currency. And I\nthink we ’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision —by the way, which\nwill be a governmentwide decision. We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the\nminds with the A dministration and also probably with Congress. We would really like to have\nbroad support for this. It’ s a very important innovation. And I think we would need that to go\nahead, and that ’s the process we’ re engaged in. Thanks very much.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you."
