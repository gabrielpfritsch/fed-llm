At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my\ncolleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee discussed overall economic conditions\nand decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. We judged that the case for an increase has strengthened but decided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives. Our current policy should help move the economy toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and price s tability. I ’ll have more\nto say about our decision shortly, but first I will review recent economic developments and the outlook.\nEconomic growth, which was subdued during the first half of the year, appears to have\npicked up. Household spending continue s to be the key source of that growth. This spending\nhas been supported by solid increases in household income as well as by relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth. Business investment, however, remains soft, both in the energy sector an d more broadly. The energy industry has been hard hit by the drop in oil prices since\nmid-2014, and investment in that sector continued to contract through the first half of the year.\nHowever, drilling is now showing signs of stabilizing. Overall, we ex pect that the economy will\nexpand at a moderate pace over the next few years.\nTurning to employment, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month over the past four\nmonths, about the same solid pace recorded since the beginning of the year. In the longer run, that’s well above the pace that we estimate is needed to provide work for new entrants in the job\nmarket. But so far this year, most measures of labor market slack have shown little change. The unemployment rate in August —4.9 percent —was the same as i n January. And a broader\nmeasure of unemployment has also flattened out —a measure that includes people who want and\n\nare available to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time\nbut would rather work full time. The fact that unemployment measures have been holding steady\nwhile the number of jobs has grown solidly shows that more people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs. This is a very welcome development, both for the individuals involved and the nation as a whole. We continue to expect that labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further over time.\nOngoing economic growth and an improving job market are key factors suppor ting our\ninflation outlook. Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures —was less than 1 percent over the 12 months ending in July, still short\nof our 2 percent objective. Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy and import prices. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more\nvolatile than other prices , has been running about 1½ percent. As transitory influences holding\ndown inflation fade and as the job market strengthens further, we continue to expect inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years.\nOur inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment t hat longer -run inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well anchored. However, we can ’t take the stability of longer -\nrun inflation expectations for granted, and we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal. Indeed, we are fully committed to achieving our\n2 percent inflation objective.\nLet me turn to the economic projections —now extending through 2019—that were\nsubmitted for this meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee participants. As always,\nparticip ants conditioned their projections on their own view of appropriate monetary policy ,\n\nwhich in turn depends on each participant ’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the\noutlook. The median projection for growth of inflation- adjusted gross domestic product , or\nGDP , is 1.8 percent this year. This figure is somewhat lower than projected in June as a result of\nthe weaker -than-expected growth seen in the first half of the year. In 2017 and 2018, the median\ngrowth projection is unchanged at 2 per cent, somewhat higher than the median estimate of\nlonger -run normal growth. In 2019, growth edges down to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated\nlonger -run rate, which has als —which has been revised down a bit since June. The median\nprojection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent at the end of this year, a touch higher\nthan in June. Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs near 4½ percent,\nmodestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate. Finally, the medi an inflation\nprojection is 1.3 per cent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018\nand 2019.\nReturning to monetary policy, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued\nprogress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the federal funds rate.\nMoreover, the Committee judges the risks to the outlook to be roughly balanced. So why didn’ t\nwe raise the federal funds rate at today ’s meeting? Our decision does not reflect a lack of\nconfidence in the economy. Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, and we expect that to continue. And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time. But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in pr evious\nyears, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued\nprogress toward our objectives. This cautious approach to paring back monetary policy support\nis all the more appropriate given that short -term interest rates are still near zero, which means\n\nthat we can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future by\nraising rates than to a weakeni ng labor market and falling inflation by cutting rates.\nWe continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain our objectives. That ’s based\non our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate —that is, the interest rate that is neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently\nquite low by historical standards. With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives. But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future,\nand gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.\nThis view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetar y policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent by the end of 2019. Compared with the projections made in June, the median path for th e federal funds rate has been revised down ¼ to\n½ percentage point. Most participants also marked down their estimate of the longer -run normal\nfederal funds rate, with the median now at 2.9 percent.\nAs I have noted on previous occasions, participants ’ projections for the federal funds rate,\nincluding the median path, are not a fixed plan for future policy. Policy is not on a preset course. These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of appropriate policy , given their\nprojections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors at a particular point in time. However, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and any assessment of the\n\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the ec onomic\noutlook and associated risks.\nFinally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and\nprincipal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities. As our statement says, we\nanticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well\nunder way. ” Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer -term securities should help maintain\naccommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the\nfederal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock.\nThank you. I ’d be happy to take your questions.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Madam Chair, critics of the Federal\nReserve have said that you look for any excuse not to hike , that the goalpost s constantly move.\nAnd it looks , indeed , like there are new goalposts now when you say looking for “ further\nevidence ” and—and you suggest that it ’s evidence that labor —labor market slack is “ being taken\nup.” Could you explain what “for the time being” means , in terms of a time frame , and what that\nfurther evidence you would look for in order to hike interest rates? And also, this notion that the goalpost s seem to move , and that you’ve indeed introduced a new goalpost with this statement.\nThank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. I’ll try to respond to those questions. Let me try to set out again how\nthe C ommittee sees the economy and what we’ re looking for. We’ re generally pleased with how\nthe U.S. economy is doing. Growth was weak in the first half of the year ; we’re seeing definite\nevidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly. As I mentioned, payroll gains in recent months have been solid, averaging around 180,000 per month, which is less than the pace in 2015, but , as I mentioned, it ’s well above what ’s needed to provide jobs for new entrants into\n\nthe labor force over time. The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants ’\nestimates of its longer -run equilibrium value. But , as I mentioned, that rate and other measures\nof labor utilization are little change d since the beginning of the year. I don ’t see that as bad\nnews, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the\nlabor force back into employment. The labor force participation rates increased on balance since late last year. It has —it is on a declining demographic trend, and the fact that it ’s increased\nshows a substantial number of people are being attracted into the labor marke t.\nThe employment -to-population ratio has also continued to increase. Now, we were not\nreally certain that this is something that would happen as the labor market strengthened, a nd it’s\ngood to see that development has taken place. And that is some news that we ’ve received in\nrecent months , that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in\nwithout the unemployment rate coming down. So we ’re not seeing strong pressures on\nutilization suggesting overheating , and my assessment would be , based on this evidence , that\nthe economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought . That’s\ngood news.\nRemember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up\nover time. So the Committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced.\nWe expect labor market conditions to continue strengthening. And we are generally agreed that\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate to remove what is a modest degree of accommodation will be a ppropriate. But we don’ t see the economy as overheating now. My colleagues and I\nexchanged views at this meeting on the appropriate timing of the next step in reducing policy stimulus. Most of us judged that the case for an immediate increase in the fed eral funds rate is\nstronger, but that it would be sensible , given the finding of a bit more running room , to wait to\n\nsee some continued progress —evidence that we continue to progress toward our objectives. So,\nfor the time being, we ’re going to watch incoming evidence , and you can see from the SEP that\nmost participants do expect that one increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this\nyear. And I would expect to see that if we continue on the current course of labor market improvement and there are no major new risks that develop and we simply stay on the current course.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Chair, thanks for this. I\nwas wondering if you could comment a little bit on the apparent tension between the stea dy drift\ndown in the long -run rate and the steady drift down in some of the projections and the seeming\nmarch toward a rate hike. If the neutral rate ’s coming down over time and continues coming\ndown and you’ re eating up accommodation that way anyway, why not wait for the dust to settle\non that before moving rates up ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So it is true that our estimates of the neutral rate are coming down ,\nand that ’s what ’s largely responsible for that shift. At the same time, we generally agree that the\nstance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative. So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than is sustainable in the longer run. Now, we have seen people\ncome into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn ’t fallen. But that ’s probably not something that is possible without the\neconomy overheating on an indefinite basis. So policy needs to be forward looking. We don’ t\nwant the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective. That’s one risk that we need to address. And I think we generally agree that some gradual\nincreases to remove that accommodation will be appropriate if we stay on this course .\n\nBut, as I emphasized, it ’s not that much accomm odation, and the economy has shown\nevidence that there are more people who are being attracted back into the labor force. So , in that\nsense, I would characterize it as , we found the economy has a bit more running room .\nNevertheless, we don ’t want the economy to overheat , and if things continue on the current\ncourse, I think that some gradual increases will be appropriate. And, mainly , what we discussed\ntoday were issues affecting the timing of such increases.\nMART IN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. Last month in\nyour speech at Jackson Hole, you seemed to raise expectations that there could be a rate hike in\nSeptember. Other Fed officials talked , including Vice Chairman Fischer . They seem ed to\nsupport that. Fed President Rose ngren had some comments that sent the markets plunging.\nThen we had —Governor Brainard seemed to draw back. Is this hurting the Fed ’s credibility do\nyou think, or is this just a normal thing that we should be looking for at this time —uncertain time\nwith the economy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I did say at Jackson Hole that I thought the case for a rate\nincrease had strengthened , and that assessment is included in today ’s statement. So I think most\nof my colleagues agree—agree with that assessment. I think we a re trying to understand some\ndifficult issues. There is less disagreement among participants in the C ommittee than you might\nthink, listening to speeches and commentary. I think we all agree that the economy is making\nprogress , that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that ’s sustainable in the longer\nrun. We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal , and that we want to make sure we\nstay on a course that raises that to 2 percent. And we ’re struggling with a difficult set of issues\nabout what is the “ new normal ” in this economy and in the global economy more generally ,\nwhich explains why we keep revising down the rate path. And, you know, it ’s very important\n\nthat in a body like ours that a whole range of views a re expressed , that we have independent -\nminded people who gather together and discuss these issues. My colleagues do explain , in their\nindividual speeches , their own perspectives. These are complicated , complex issues , and it just\nisn’t straightforward ex actly how to interpret what is appropriate policy and exactly what is\ngoing on in the economy. My —my sense is that market participants and the public more\ngenerally learn more about the issues that we’ re grappling with as they listen to th is set of\nspeech es. And I think it ’s a very good thing that the FOMC is not a body that suffers from\ngroupthink. And you see that —you see that ’s one of the, you know, real worries in an\norganization, that everybody thinks identically. But there ’s a lot that we share in common and\nexpress , both in our statement and in our speeches. And we are debating and discussing issues\npertaining to timing.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Chair Yellen, Donald\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee , has charged that the Fed is keeping interest rates\nartificially low to support the Obama A dministration. I’d like to hear what you have to say to\nthat charge. And, on a related note, I wanted to ask you about the Fed ’s next policy meeting ,\nwhich is in e arly November , a week before the next election —given that the case for raising\nrates , you say today , has strengthened, should the public see that November meeting as a live\nmeeting when a rate action could happen? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think C ongress very wisely established the Federal Reserve a s\nan independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short -term political pressures.\nAnd I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the\nappropriate s tance of monetary policy. We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster\nprice stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as\n\naffecting the outlook. We do not discuss politics at our meetings , and we do not take politics\ninto account in our decisions.\nAs I said, we ’re generally pleased with the progress of the economy. And the decision\nnot to raise rates today and to wait for some further evidence that we ’re continuing on this course\nis largely based on the judgment that we ’re not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating ,\nand that we are seeing evidence that people are being drawn in —in larger numbers than at least I\nwould have expected —into the labor market , and that that ’s healthy to continue , but th at,\nnevertheless, we do need to be forward looking. And if we continue along this course, it likely\nwill be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate. And November you asked about as well.\nWell, every meeting is live , and we will again assess , as we always do , incoming evidence in\nNovember and decide whether or not a move is warranted.\nCRAIG TORRES. Madam Chair, Craig Torres from Bloomberg. What observable data\nwould convince you and the C ommittee that this neutral federal funds rate is starting to move\nup? There’ s a popular piece of research by one of your colleagues that suggests that it ’s at zero\nright now. And , second, I ’m struck by your opening remarks that the economy is —isn ’t\noverheating . But does —does that mean the C ommittee sees this global reach -for-yield going on\nright now as very low cost to its policy? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So you asked, first : What evidence would suggest that the neutral\nreal rate is moving up ? Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecast s, revising\ndown our estimates , well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know , if you saw this, you\nwould see revisions in the funds rate path. But if unemployment were moving down faster than\nwe had anticipated , if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be\nsuggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had\n\nincreased. I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that , while the economy has made a\nlot of progress, it ’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been\ncharacterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of\ntime. Let’s see, and then you asked about global factors. So global factors, capital flows —\nCRAIG TORRES. —about the global reach -for-yield and whether the C ommittee saw\nthat as a cost to its accommodative policy right now.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, in most advanced nati ons now, we have highly accommodative\npolicies , and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and\nemployment objectives. And that ’s characteristic of a —an environment in which the neutral\nrate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low. And that is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield as individuals and investors seek to, perhaps, take\non risk or lengthen maturities to seek higher —to seek higher yields.\nAnd I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability\nrisks. And we are very aware that those are possible. We engage in regular assessments of\nfinancial stability factors that bear on financial stability. Overall, I would say that the threats to financial stability I would characterize, at this point, as moderate. Not —I mean —so, I would\ncharacterize it as moderate.\nIn general, I would not s ay that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but\nthere are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on: commercial real estate, where\nprice- to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low. And that ’s something that has caught\nour attention. We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks. We’ve recently issued new supervisory guidance pertaining to commercial real estate. I would\n\nsay, in the area of commercial real estate , while valuations are high, we are seeing some\ntightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real\nestate prices. But , more generally, we’ re not seeing signs of leverage building up or maturity\ntransformati on in the way that we saw in the run -up to the crisis , and we ’re keeping a close eye\non it.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . Two quasi -related questions.\nOne, Bill Dudley earlier this year suggested that political uncertainty in the U .S. may be one of\nthe depressants on business investment at the moment. I wondered if you’ d seen any furt her\nevidence that election risk was one of the reasons that business es are holding back at the margin.\nA second was a follow -up on your Jackson Hole sp eech where you presented a fairly\noptimistic sense of the scope for further monetary stimulus. You did raise the question of\nautomatic stabilizers in the U.S., however . Are you concern ed that there is in sufficient fiscal\nbackup to the F ed, and too much is effectively being lumped on the shoulders of the central b ank\nif there is a fresh downturn? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, starting with the issue of political uncertainty and investment,\ninvestment spending really has been quite weak for some time, a nd we ’re really not certain\nexactly what is causing that. Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spend ing extends\nbeyond—beyond that sector, a nd I’m not cer tain of exact ly what explains that, whether —I’m not\naware of evidence that suggest s that it’ s politica l uncertainty, but it certainly —I would agree\nwith the finding that it has been weak. Consumer sentiment is perfectly solid. We ’re seeing a lot\nof stren gth in consumer spending, and consumer sentiment certainly seems to be solid.\n\nYou asked about scope for further monetary policy action. I was careful in Jackson Hole .\nI indicated we have a number of tools that we ’ve used before and could use again. I did indicate\nthat I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy. N evertheless , at this po int our\nbalance sheet is large, and we’ re not at what we see a s the normal level —longer -run level of\ninterest rates. S o, at the mom ent, the funds rate is very low. It’s below that normal level. So , at\nthe moment , I would say the zero lower bound is a concern, and we have less scope than I would\nlike to see or expect us to have in the longer run.\nNow, I think it would be —it would be worthwhile for other policy makers to think about\nwhat role they could play in addressing negative shocks should they come . And I mentioned\nspecifically automatic stabilizers because I think that ’s an important way in which fiscal policy\nserves to cushion shocks to the economy . And it would seem to me, without getting into\nspecifics, that there are ways in which the response of fiscal policy to shifts in the economy\ncould be strengthen ed, which would help take s ome burden off monetary policy.\nBINYAMIN APPE LBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times . In the run- up to\nthe Brexit v ote earlier this year, several Fed policymakers cited it as a reason that they were\nreluctant to raise rates in June because of the uncertainty associ ated with that vote. In the run- up\nto the president ial election , I have not heard any Fed policy maker give that as a reason that they\nmight want to delay raising rates in November. Could you explain why the Fed regards Brexit as\na greater danger to the American economy than the presidential election that’s actually\nhappening here? And , second , there were three dissents at this meeting. C ould you explain what\nthe cause of disagreement was , what those policyma kers thought?\nCHA IR YELLEN. So we are very focused on evaluating, given the way the economy is\noperating, what is the r ight policy to foster our goals, and I ’m not going to get into politics . I’m\n\njust—those are factors that we don’ t consider , and I don ’t—I’m not going to get involved in\ncommenting on the election.\nIn terms of the dissents, a s I indicated , the notion that we do have some accommodation,\nthat if we continue on the current path, it ’s something we will need to remove over time. There ’s\ngeneral agreement among participants on that, but the preci se timing of what is the right—what\nis the right timing for removing that accommodation is something on which we had active\ndiscussions , and there are a range of opinions . And the dissents represent a judgment on the pa rt\nof some of my colleagues that it’ s important to begin that process now.\nI certainly agree, and I ’ve said myself , that there are risks in waiting to o long to remove\naccommodation, and we need to take a forward -looking approach. I’ve always advocated\nmaking policy base d on forecast s of where the economy is heading and taking account of risks.\nAnd there are two particular risks that we need to think about and balance.\nOne is the risk that the economy r uns too hot , that unemploy —the labor market tighten s\ntoo much, that unemploy ment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less\ngradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that , because that is a very difficult\nthing to accomplish , to gently create a bit more slack in t he labor market, we could cause a\nrecession in the process. And so that ’s something my colleagues and I certainly wouldn’ t want\nto be responsible for. We would all like to have a very long expansion, with the labor market operat ing well for many years to come, and the prospect that we could create —create downside\nrisk for the labor market is something we would like to avoid, a nd taking “ a stitch in time ” might\nbe essential to avoiding that.\nOn the other hand, i nflation is running below our 2 percent objec tive, a nd it’s also\nimportant that we make sure we get back to 2 percent . And I have routinely indicated a number\n\nof measures of inflation expectations that are running at the low ends of their historical range ,\nand we ’re watching that as well. And there would also be risks from not seei ng inflation move\nback to our 2 percent objective. And exactly how to balance these two risks, which is more\nserious —which is a more serious risk—can affect one’ s judgment about the appropriate timing,\nand we ’re all strug gling to understand the magnitude and nature of those two risks.\nREBECCA JARVIS. Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News. Chair Yellen, at a time when the\npublic is losing faith in many institutions, did the FOMC discuss the importance of today as an\nopportunity t o dis pel the thinking that the F ed is politically compromised or beholde n to\nmarkets?\nCHAIR YELLEN. The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised. We do not\ndiscuss politics in our meetings. I can ’t recall any meeting that I have ever attended where\npolitics has been a matter of discussion. I think the public, if they had been w atching our\nmeeting on TV today, would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about\nthe risks an d the forecast s for the economy, a nd we struggled mighti ly with trying to understand\none another ’s points of view and to come out at a balanc ed place and to act responsibly. A nd\nthat’s my co mmitment to the American people, that I want to lead an ins titution that is not\npolitical and is —that we are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has\nassigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment.\nREBECCA JARVIS. Does it concern you, given what Donald Trump has said at this\npoint about the Feder al Reserve, that he could go back, if he were P resident, and look at the\nminutes and look for signs of the F ed being polit ically motivated and find them?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I have no concern that the pol —the Fed is politically motivated, a nd I\nwill assure that you will n ot find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are\n\nreleased in five years. We —I—it is important that we maintain the confidence of the public, a nd\nI do believe that we deserve it. I know tha t these are difficult decisions, and everybody m ay not\nagree with them, but I hope the public will understand that we ’re striving to do our best to pursue\nthese goals that do matter to all of us.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. You\nmentioned commercial real estate . Are you worried that bubbles could form in the economy\nbecause of our prolonged low interest rates?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Yes. Of course, we —we are worried that bub bles could form in the\neconomy, a nd we rout inely monitor asset valuations. W hile nobody can know for sure what type\nof valuation represents a bubble —that’s only something one can tell in hindsight —we are\nmonitoring these measures of valuation, a nd commercial real estate valuations are high . Rents\nhave moved up over time, but , still, valuations are high relative to rents. And so it is som ething\nwe’ve discussed. We called this out in our Monetary Policy Report and in other presentations.\nAnd we are—we are, in our supervision with banks, as I indicated, w e have issued\nsupervisory guida nce to make sure that under writing sta ndards are sound on these loans, and\nwe’re aware—t his is something also that we look at in stress test s of the large—the larger banks\nto see what would happen to their capital positions and to make sure that the y hold sufficient\ncapital. An d, of course, I think the soundness and state of the banking system ha s improved\nsubstantially , but, of course , we are focused on such things.\nPETER BARNES. Chair Yellen, over here. Hi. Quick question on regulation and the\nscandal at Wells Fargo over phony customer accounts. I know that there are other regulators that\nhave looked into this , but you are also a regulator of Wells Fargo. Have— has the F ed opened a\nseparate investigation into this —these practices at Wells Fargo? And —and wouldn’ t you,\n\nbecause they do involve issues of consumer protection, potentially of risk management and\ncorporate governance, and are you looking at them broadly across the banking system r ight now?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, in this specific case, the abuses that occurred took place in a\nnational bank. T he Comptroller of the C urrency has responsibility there. And on the consumer\nside, it is the CFPB that has responsibility, but we work cooperatively and closely with those\norganizations.\nAnd in terms of our overall supervisory responsibility for Wells and ot her large banking\norganizations, we are very focused , and this will be a particular focus of our supervision going\nforward over the next year or so on the compliance environment to make sure that the contr ols,\nthat the senior management oversight, that the involvement of the boards of directors are appropriate to control these kinds of risks. We have been distressed to see banking organizations\nresponding when a pa rticular problem arises, a nd what we ’d really want to see is robust\nprocedures that ensure that employees are always acting in a legal and ethical manner , and that\nthe incentives that are put in place in these organizations are appropriate and don’ t serve to foster\nbehav ior that could harm the public . And this has been and will be a focus of our supervision.\nJIM TANKERSLEY. Hi. Jim Tankersley, Washington Post . Over the past year we ’ve\nseen American policymakers begin to have maybe our most serious discussion about tariffs in the last several decades. If tariffs were to be enacted in t he coming year or so, does the F ed have\nan opinion on what that would do to growth in America?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, that ’s a political issue that ’s currently being debated\nthat I really don ’t want to get into. You know, s o—I’m going to —I’m going to pass on that one.\nJOHN HELTMAN. Hi. John Heltman with American Banker . Back to a question about\nWells or related to Wells. One of the con cerns that has been raised —that this scandal has\n\nraised —is that the bank itself says it doesn ’t know what was happening, a nd there are thousands\nof employees that were involved in this. Some are calling for a breakup, saying that the banks\nare too big to manage. Do you think that —leaving aside the question of Wells specificall y, do\nyou think that it ’s possible for a bank to get so big that it can’ t be managed , and that perhaps the\nbest prudential step would be to break it up?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have hig h expectations for what we expect to be in place in a\nlarge organization or in any banking organization. We expect there to be robust systems of risk management, strong audit functions, a board of directors that is monitoring and supervising and holding s enior management accountable for things that happen throughout the organization in a\nstrong c ompliance environment, a nd I don’ t think that these are impossible standards to meet .\nThey may be challenging , but I wouldn’ t at this point arrive at the conclusion that just because an\norganization is large , it can ’t live up to those standards . And those are our expectations , and we\nintend to hold banking organizations responsible for putting in place that kind of —that kind of\nrisk-management and complian ce environment.\nJOHN HELTMAN. So , “No”?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I’m not —I’m not endorsing a general conclusion that banks are —\nbanks of that size are too big to manage. I believe they can be, but it may be challenging , and\nthat’s what we expect.\nERIK SCHATZKER. Erik Schatzker from Bloomberg Television. Madam Chair, thank\nyou. I have a question about the rate trajectory the Fed outline d today in the dot plot. While\nthere is clearly a wide range, the median expectation is for the fed funds target to rise by\n½ percentage point in 2017, ¾ of a point in 2018, and a further ¾ of a point in 2019, bringing us to 2½ to 2¾ percent , and then 2¾ percent to 3 percent in the long run. At the same time, the\n\nmedian forecast for GDP growth is 2 percent for the next two years and 1.8 percent thereafter.\nAnd, I should add, the most optimistic proje ction is for growth of just 2½ percent of all the\nprojections outlined here. So if economic growth is going to be that slow for that long, where\nwill the inflationary forces emerge that would require tightening of 250 basis points from where we are now? And if not inflation, is there some other explanation?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So the projections —I agree , the projections for growth are slow. We\nhave further written down our estimate of the longer -run normal gro wth rate. And what that\nreflects is an assessment that productivity growth is likely to remain low for an extended time ,\nalthough it does embody an expectation that it will pick up from the miserable ½ percent pace\nper year that we have seen over the last five years.\nNow, why we would never —and slow growth is a factor. Slow productivity growth is a\nfactor that influences the longer -run normal level of interest rates , and writing down the likely\npace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate. That ’s an important reason for revising down the neutral\nrate.\nBut now, let ’s go to your —the part of your question about inflation. In spite of having\nsuch slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated a n average of about 230,000 jobs a month a nd so far this year has been generating\nabout 180,000 jobs a month. And that is a very solid pace of job growth and a pace that likely is\nnot sustainable in the longer run, a lthough we ’ve been pleased to see people come back in the\nlabor market. So it certainly is sustainable for some further amount of time.\nBut I think what ultimatel y drives inflation, both wage and price growth, is that tightness\nin the labor market and pressure on resource utilization. And the sad fact is that we are getting\n\nthat healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output. So this is —I don’ t\nthink it bears on the inflation outlook. I t has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for\nthe neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity\ngrowth ultimately means slow growth in living standards. An d that ’s a big concern that\npolicymakers should be focused on.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. Back to Wells Fargo . You\nknow, obviously, this was more of a consumer finance kind of a question, but I ’m wondering if\nyou think it does pos e safety and soundness questions, if something like this is widespread ac ross\na big bank. And you had mention ed that this is going to be a supervisory focus over the coming\nyear. Are there any adjustments that you can speak to that might be warranted , given these\nrevelations?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, as I mentioned, we are going to be focusing on compliance ris k\nmanagement and board oversight not only at Wells, but also across bank holding companies. Of\ncourse, consumer issues and issues that involve harm of consumers can become safety and soundness issues. And if there was —at least one of the lessons from the financial crisis , I think,\nis that abuses of consumers of the sort that we see —saw in subprime lending ultimately did\nbecome—become safety and soundness issues. And so, of course, we need to have that concern, and we ’ll focus there. I think— I can ’t really at this point give you specifics beyond that.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Hi , Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires. A large number of\ncongressional Democrats a s well as the campaign of Hillary Clinton would like bankers removed\nfrom the boards overseeing the regional F ed banks. Also, other reformers would like to see the\nprivate ownership of the regional —the bank ownership of the regional Feds ended and that the\n\nregional F eds be brought fully into government , and I wanted to know what you thought of those\ntwo proposals.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have a system that Congress did set up in the Federal Reserve\nAct in which the governance of the Reserve B anks involves banks contributing capital and\nserving on the boards of directors. We have long recognized inside the Federal Reserve that\nwhen we ’re charged with supervision of banks , having banker s involved in that obviously\npresents conflict of interest. And we have put in place very strong measures to ensure that those\nconflicts of interest are not allowed to play out in any —in any way, that bankers are not allowed\nto be involved in supervision. Dodd- Frank changed the arrangement so that only the C lass B and\nC, or nonbanking , directors can participate in the selection of the president as well.\nSo I think— I want to make sure the public has confidence that , in spite of the fact th at we\ndo have this banker involvement in our boards of directors , that it is not giving rise to any\nconflicts in our actual conduct of policy. Now, that setup—if that setup is changed, it raises\nwhich —it’ s up to Congress to decide what to do here. It raises complex issues about the\ngovernance —the whole governance arrangement in the R eserve Banks in the Federal Reserve,\nand I would simply caution that if that is looked at, as Congress is entitled to do, that they think through carefully what the ramifications of making changes would be.\nKAREN MRACEK. Karen Mracek with Market News International. You mentioned in\na previous answer the need to be forward looking , but you’ ve also pointed to the economy not\noverheating as a reason you could, you know, hold off on raising rates at this one. Monetary policy ha s traditionally operated with long and variable lags. Do you think this timeline has\nchanged since the financial crisis or due to the u se of unconventional tools that the F ed used , and\nhow does that factor into your decisionmaking?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and\nvariable lags —that statement is due to Milton Friedman , and it is one of the ess ential things to\nunderstand about monetary policy , and it ha s not fundamentally change d at all. And that is why\nI believe we h ave to be forward looking , and I ’m not in favor of a “whites of their eyes ” sort of\napproach. We need to operate based on forecasts.\nBut the global economy and the U .S. economy have changed a lot. History doesn ’t\nalways exactly replay itself. Many of th e—those of us sittin g around the table, we learned the\nlesson that if policy is not forward looking, that inflation can pick up t o highly undesirable\nlevels , that inflation expectations can be dislodged upward, and the consequence of that can be\nthat, endemically , higher inflation takes place , which —it is very costly to reduce. And\nabsolut ely none of us want to relive a n episode like that. And so I believe , and my colleagues ,\nthat it is important to be forward looking. We ’re not going to make that mistake again.\nBut the structure of the economy changes, things do change. The nature of the inflation\nprocess ha s changed , I think , significantly since the bad days of the ’ 70s when the Fed had to\nface this chronic high -inflation problem. We ’ve seen infl ation respond less to the economy, to\nmovements in the unemployment rate —that ’s sometimes sa id, “The Phillips curve has become\nflatter. ” So we ’ve seen less of a response . That’s something we need to factor into our\ndecisionmaking. Inflation expectations appear to be better anchored, and perhaps that ’s been a\nresult of a long period of low and stable inflation. That’s an asset . It’s something we didn’ t have\nin the 1970s. And , in addition, we have to be attentive to the fact there we ’ve now had a long\nperiod in which inflation is actually undershooting our 2 percent objective. And we see some\nsigns that I —we conclude inflation expectations are reasonably well anch ored at 2 percent. But\nwe are seeing signs suggesting possible slippage there , and we ’re a long way from being —facing\n\nthe problems that Japan faces. But there always a remi—should be a reminder to us that we also\nwould not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low—running below\nour objective , inflation expectations are slipping . And with a low neutral rate , that becomes\nmore important. So things are changed, but the principle of “ forward looking ” absolutely hold s.\nPATRICK GILLESPIE. Hi, Patrick Gillespie with CNN. Chair Yellen, you just\nmentioned one of the economy ’s major problems : low productivity growth. And one of the\nsolutions that ’s been proposed widely is better job skills. Many economists say that some\nworkers are staying on the sidelines because they don’ t—they, you know, they lack new job\nskills, the ones that would help them obtain better employment. The Fed doesn ’t have the\nauthority to finance or run its own job training program or apprenticeship, but would you want\nthat authority from Congress ? And is it at all frustrating that you know —you and your\ncolleagues know one of the solutions to fixing a major issue in the economy , but you can’ t take\nthe concrete steps to solving that issue ?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well , I do think job training and job skills are important. And we do\nwork in community developme nt, trying to —in the local communities where the Reserve B anks\noperate, to try to foster broader understanding of what kinds of programs work and how\ncommunity organizations in state and local governments can put in place programs that will be helpful. I’ve recently visited a program that was very impressive in Philadelphia . I’ve visited\nsome in Chicago and other places. So I do believe it ’s possible to design programs that will help\npeople overcome obstacles in getting jobs that are available. But I de finitely think that, you\nknow, while we can play some role in facilitating understanding of what works and what doesn ’t\nwork that can be helpful, it ’s certainly worthwhile for policymakers at the federal level, at state\n\nand local levels , to be focusing on this , becau se I think it is an area that would be helpful in\nmaking progress.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Madam Chair, Mark Hamrick with B ankrate.com. As\nwe’ve gotten to this 4.9 percent unemployment rate, as you know , through this year ’s long\nrecovery, we have yet to see substantial pickup in wage growth. And it seems as if the American\nmiddle class continues to express some disappointment about that. Is there better news on the\nhorizon? Do you think it could come in 2017, for example, and if not, when?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I th ink we have seen some modest pickup in wage growth. It’s\nrunning a li ttle bit higher than it was over the last two years by a number of important measures.\nAnd we have seen income growth pick up recently. I think the C ensus report was encouraging,\nshowing that there are income gains , both because of more jobs and higher -paying jobs , and that\nthat’s occurring throughout the income distribution. I t’s helping many families. But I do\nexpect —we expect the unemployment rate to decline f urther , we expect labor market conditions\nto continue to improve . And my hope and expectation is that we will see some further pickup in\nwage growth , and that it will be broadly beneficial to American households."
