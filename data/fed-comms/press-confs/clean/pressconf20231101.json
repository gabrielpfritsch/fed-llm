  "text": "November 1 , 2023\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon , everyone . Welcome. My colleagues and I remain\nsquarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for\nthe American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor m arket conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that\ntight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—a nd the full\neffects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate\nunchanged and to continue to reduce our securi ties holdings. Given how far we have come,\nalong with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will\nmake decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on th e totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks. I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and\nwell above earlier expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer s pending. After picking up\nsomewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well\n\nbelow levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also\nappear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the\nsupply of workers. T he labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined\nso far this year. Although the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, l abor demand still exceeds the\nsupply of available workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose\n3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent. Inflation has moderated since t he middle of last\nyear, and readings over the summer were quite favorable. But a few months of good data are\nonly the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain\nwell anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecast ters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for\n\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 perc ent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage\npoints, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We are committed to achieving a sta nce of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.\nWe are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand\nfor labor. Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is\nno longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further\ntightening of monetary policy.\nFinancial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher\nlonger -term bond yields, among other factors. Because persistent changes in financial conditions\ncan have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financi al developments\nclosely.\nIn light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is\nproceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of additional policy firming\n\nthat may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into\naccount the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require\na period of below -potential growth and some softening of labor market condit ions. Restoring\nprice stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you, Chair Powell,\nfor doing this. To what —you referenced the rise in long- term bond yields —to what degree did\nthat supplant action by the F ed at this meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks for your question. So, I ’ll talk about bond yields, but I want\nto take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we ’re looking at that. So, if\nyou—if you look at the situation —let’ s look at the economy first . Inflation has been coming\ndown, but it ’s still running well above our 2 percent target. The labor market has been\nrebalancing , but it ’s still very tight by many measures. GDP growth has been strong, although\nmany forecasters are forecasting , and they have bee n forecasting, that it will slow.\n\nAs for the C ommittee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that ’s\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we ’re not confident yet\nthat we have achieved such a stance. So that is the broader context into which this , this strong\neconomy and all the things I said —that’s the context in which we ’re looking at this question of\nrates.\nSo, obviously we ’re monitoring , we’re attentive to the increase in longer -term yields\nand—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.\nAs I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy. In this case , the tighter financial conditions we ’re seeing —[coming]\nfrom higher long -term rates , but also from other sources , like the stronger dollar and lower\nequity prices —could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.\nThe first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent . And that is something\nthat remains to be seen. But that ’s critical . Things are fluctuating back and forth— that’s not\nwhat we ’re looking for. With financial conditions, we ’re looking for persistent changes that are\nmaterial.\nThe second thing is that , that the longer -term rates that have moved up—they can ’t\nsimply be a reflection of , of expected policy moves from us that we would then— that if we\ndidn’ t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down. So, and I would say on\nthat, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near -term policy rates is causing the\nincrease in longer -term rates. So, in the meantime , though, perhaps the most important thing is\nthat these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing cost s for households\nand businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind ’s eye goes to the 8 percent —near 8 percent mortgage rate,\n\nwhich could have pretty significant effect on housing. So that ’s how I would answer your\nquestion.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Just as a quick follow -on, to be clear on this : In your opening\nstatement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions\nare restrictive enough to finish the fight. Is that true?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes . That’s exactly right. You know, t o say it a different way : We\nhaven’ t made any decisions about , about future meetings. We have not made a determination ,\nand we ’re not —I will say that we ’re not confident at this time that we ’ve reached such a stance.\nWe’re not confident that we haven’ t; we’re not confident that we have. And that ’s—that is —the\nway we ’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be , you know, just determining the\nextent of any additional further policy tighte ning that may be appropriate to return inflation to\n2 percent over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean na.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. T hank you so much for taking our questions. I\nwonder , you know, if you don’ t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at\nthat point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting\nrate increases next year? And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, let me start by saying we haven’ t made a decision about\nSeptember . You’re asking a hypothetical there . But we ’re going into December meeting —we ’ll\nget, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on\neconomic activity, and so we ’ll be taking —and also the broader situation , the broader financial\ncondition situation and broader world situation. W e’ll be looking at all those things as we make\na decision in December. We haven ’t made that decision.\n\nI would say, though, that , that the idea that if you —the idea that would— difficult to raise\nagain after stopping for a meeting or two , it’s just not right. I mean , the C ommittee will always\ndo what it thinks is appropriate at the time. And , again, we haven’ t made any decisions about —\nat all about December. We didn’ t even —we didn’ t talk about making a decision in December\ntoday. R eally , it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things .\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, did the F ed\nstaff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today ’s meeting? And\nhow much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening\nis persistent ? You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the\nspring. What is it here on something that ’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar\nto simulate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I don’ t want to answer your question about the—about the\nrecession . But the answer is “ no.” I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the\nminutes —you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes —the staff did not put a recession back in. I\nmean , it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the —look at the activity\nwe’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.\nIn terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it ’s just too early to be\ndoing that, and the main reason is we just don’ t know how persistent this will be. You can see\nhow volatile it is . Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates , and I think any kind of an\nestimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly. So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you\ncan see that in the rates t hat, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now .\n\nAnd over time , that will have an effect . We just don’ t know how persistent it ’s going to be , and\nit’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I ’d be comfortable communicating in to how many\nrate hikes that is.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I ’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident —what\nmakes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above -trend growth when\n500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I just— that’s, you know, the way our policy works is —and\nsometimes it works with lags , of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately , if you\nraise interest rates, you do see those effects . And you see those effects in the economy now .\nYou see what ’s happening in the housing market . You’re seeing that now . You’ll see, if you\nlook at surveys of people, it ’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds\nbecause rates are so high now. I mention again, we ’re getting reports from housing that the\neffects of this —of this could be quite significant. But you’ re right. This has been a resilient\neconomy. A nd it’s, I think , been surprising in its resilience. A nd there are a number of possible\nreasons why that may be. Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability ,\nand so we take the economy as it comes. It has been resilient, so we just —we take it as it is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMTH. Thank you. Colby Smith with t he Financial Times. In terms of the\nthresholds that you’ ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence\nof persistently above -trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market\ntightness —that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike\nwould be necessary. And I ’m just curious if that’ s how the C ommittee sees it.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So we ’ve identified those factors . Those were not meant to be the\nonly factors or a specific test that we ’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.\nReally , we’re going to be looking at the broader picture . You know, what ’s happening with our\nprogress toward the 2 percent inflation goal ? Is the labor market continuing to , broadly, cool off\nand achieve a better balance? W e’ll be looking at that. You know, growth —we look at growth\ninsofar as it has implications for our two manda te goals . We look at that, and we look at broader\nfinancial conditions. So we ’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you\nknow, whether we need to further tighten policy. A nd, if we do reach that judgment, then we\nwill further tighten policy.\nCOLBY SMITH. Okay . And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if\nthat is having some kind of offsetting e ffect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,\nwhat then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts? Could we see those maybe pulled\nforward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it ’s, it’s—the fact is the C ommittee is not thinking about rate cuts\nright now at all. We ’re not talking about rate cuts . We’re still very focused on the first question,\nwhich is , have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably? That is the question we ’re focusing on. The\nnext question, as you know, will be , for how long will we remain restrictive? Will policy remain\nrestrictive ? And what we ’ve sa id there is that we ’ll keep policy restrictive until we ’re confident\nthat inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. That ’ll be the next question, but\nhonestly, right now we ’re really tightly focused on the first question. The question of rate cuts\njust doesn ’t come up because I think the first —it’s so important to get that first question , you\nknow, as close to right as you can.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that\nthere was a tightening bias in the C ommittee . You say in the statement you ’re looking to assess\nthe appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally. You didn’ t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive . There were forecasts for two rate\nhikes among most members of the C ommittee . But then you just said that , you know, we\ndon’t—we haven ’t made a determination. Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there\nis no disposition to hike again and that the C ommittee largely has moved off of this forecast for\ntwo hikes? Sorry, one additional —\nCHAIR POWELL. No . I wouldn’ t say that at all. I would say—I mean , the language ,\nlooking at it here, “I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate\nto return inflation to 2 percent over time. ” That ’s the question we ’re asking.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the C ommittee\nhere?\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven ’t used that term, but it ’s fair to say that ’s the question\nwe’re asking is, should we hike more ? It’s not —it’s not, you know —that is the question, and\nyou’re right that, in September , we wrote down one additional rate hike. But, you know —and\nwe’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press. Well, since the last\nmeeting, the auto workers ’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet , on the other\nhand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. How do you see all those factors ,\ntaken together, affecting the economy going forward? How are you thinking about those?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So , there are significant issues out there, as you point out . Global\ngeopolitical tensions are certainly elevated . And that goes for the war in Ukraine ; it goes for the\nwar between Israel and Hamas. We’re monitoring that. O ur job is to monitor those things for\ntheir economic implications. So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to\nan end. Oil prices have flattened out ; they haven ’t gone down. I guess they ’ve gone down a\nlittle bit from their earlier peak. Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we\ndon’t know about that one. So there ’s plenty of risk out there. But I would go back to—the\nbigger picture from our standpoint is, we ’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,\nmaking progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation . And we ’re very focused on\ngetting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive. That’s really our focus.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great . And just one quick thing: Y ou, last month , had gone to\nYork, Pennsylvania , where you talked to a lot of —or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot\nof small business owners. Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t say I was terribly surprised. I was very impressed by\nYork as a town with a real strategy. And I would say it ’s very impressive what the people there\nhave put together in the face of , you know, some difficult longer- run trends about offshoring of\nmanufacturing and that kind of thing. They ’ve done a great job as a city , I think. You know,\nwhat you hear —and it ’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high\ninflation. You were there . We talked to some people who , you know, were feeling that in their\nbusinesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well. You know, i t’s\n\npainful for people —particularly people who don’ t have a lot of extra financial resources who are\nspending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life. So we know that .\nThat wasn ’t new. But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in\nYork, and, you know, I walked away from that even —you know, I mean , just thinking that we\nreally —the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability —fully restore price\nstability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage\nwe can.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You ’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for\nthe economy in order to get inflation down. But since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all —on\nhow necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall\ngrowth?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well , I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we ’ve been\nable to achieve , you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of\nincrease in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one. So\nthat’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result. And the same is true of growth.\nYou know, w e’ve been saying that we need to see below -potential growth . And growth has been\nstrong, but yet we ’re still seeing this. I think I still believe , and my colleagues for the most part I\nthink still believe, that is likely to be true. It is still likely to be true —not a certainty —but likely\nthat we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market —in labor\nmarket conditions to get , you know, to fully restore price stability. So—but it ’s only a good\n\nthing that we haven’ t seen it , and I think we know why. You know, s ince, since we lifted off,\nwe, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here . One of them —one of\nwhich is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the\npandemic and the response to the pandemic. And the other is , is, you know, restrictive monetary\npolicy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover —time and space\nto recover. So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation. But it’ s\nthat first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth, it ’s just —it’s supply—you know, supply- side improvements like shortages and\nbottlenecks and that kind of thing going away. It’ s getting , you know, a significant increase in\nthe size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration. That’s a big supply- side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it ’s part of\nwhy—part of why GDP is so high is because we’ re getting that supply. So, we welcome that.\nBut I th ink those things will run their course , and we ’re probably still going to be left —we think,\nand I think —we ’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability . And\nthat’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. A gainst that backdrop, if you’ ve gotten any clarity on lags —if you\nhave an economy that ’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that\nthere isn ’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and\nthat it may have already come into effect?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I continue to think it ’s very hard to say. So it ’s been one\nyear at this meeting —one year ago , this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes . So that ’s a\nfull year since then. I think we are seeing the effects of , of all the hiking we did last year and this\nyear—we ’re seeing it. It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be. But you can, for\n\nexample —an example where you wouldn’ t have felt this yet is , is debt that had been termed out.\nBut it’ s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after. So —and there\nare little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy. So I\ndon’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags\nare. I think trying to make a clear— get a clear answer and say, “ I’m just going to assume this is\nreally not a good way to do it. ” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process\ndown this year , was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy. A nd it takes time .\nWe know that, and you can’ t rush it. So, doing—slowing down is giving us , I think , a better\nsense of , of how much more we need to do, i f we need to do more.\nMICHEL LE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I ’m\ntrying to connect the dots here . One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel ’s question\nis, you said you need slower growth. You had always said before a period of lower -than-trend\ngrowth. Has that changed? And , two, it sounds to me like you’ re basically saying here that kind\nof the dot plot ’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase\nfor right now —doesn’ t matter about the turn of the year—a nd that there ’s not an objective way\nto determine whether or not you’ ve got enough tightening in the system. It ’s just going to be a\nsubjective judgment, meeting by meeting.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well so, let ’s talk about the dot plot first. So the dot plot is a picture\nin time of what the people in the C ommittee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in\nlight of their own personal economic forecast. In principle, when things change, it ’s not —that ’s\nnot, like , planned that anybody’ s agreed to or that we will do. That ’s a forecast that would\nchange, for example —I mean , many things could change that would cause people to say, “ I\n\nwouldn’ t write down that dot six weeks later. ” Think of the number of things that could change\nyour mind on that. So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three -month\nperiod between that meeting and the next meeting. But , nonetheless, it ’s out there . We don’ t—\nwe do personally update our forecast, but we don’ t formally update the dot plot. So , you know, I\nthink we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’ re thinking about these things .\nWe’re laying out there our thinking , and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we ’ll all be —\nmy colleagues and I will be talking about how we ’re processing that data.\nIn terms of —so we ’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was\n“below potential .” So what you have here recently is growth that is —that is temporarily —\npotential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level. So the right way to\nthink about it is, what ’s potential growth this year? People think trend growth over a long period\nof time is a little bit less than 2 percent , or I would say just around 2 percent. But what we ’ve\nhad is , with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,\nthrough both participation and immigration, and with the , the, you know, the better functioning\nin the labor market and with the —with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and\nshortages and those kinds of things, you’ re seeing actually elevated potential growth. There ’s\ncatch -up growth that can happen in potential. And that means that if you ’re growing— you could\nbe growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy. I hope that ’s clear. That’s really what ’s going on. That ’s why I would say it as\nbelow potential.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by\nmeeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it ’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting\n\nwith a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at\neach meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, I don’ t know that I want to just accept anybody’ s\ncharacterization, but I ’ll tell you how we ’re doing this. So, we ’re going meeting by meeting.\nWe’re asking ourselves whether we’ ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive\nto bring inflation down to 2 percent over time . That’s the question we ’re asking. We ’re looking\nat the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we\nlook at, and then we ’re, we’re —you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking\ncycle, very far. And you saw the spread at the September meeting of —you know, it’ s a\nrelatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes. So you’ re close to the —to\nthe end of the cycle. That’s —that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September. It’s not a\npromise or a plan of the future. And so we ’re going into these meetings one by one . We’re\nlooking at the data . As I mentioned, w e’re also —we ’re being careful . We’re proceeding\ncarefully because we can proceed carefully at this time. Monetary policy is restrictive . We see\nits effects, particularly in interest -sensitive spending and other channels . So that ’s how I think\nabout it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi , Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. In light of the run -up\nin long- term yields we’ ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the\npace of your asset runoff program? And if there were judgment that higher —that the higher -\nterm premium was endangering the dual -mandate goals, would that be reason to think about\nslowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around\nreserves?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So the C ommittee is not considering changing the pace of balance\nsheet runoff. It’ s not something we ’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many\ncandidate explanations for why rates have been going up. A nd QT is certainly on that list. It\nmay be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it ’s\nnot—I think —I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.\nSo that ’s not something that we ’re—that we’re looking at right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guid a with Politico. I wanted to ask about the Basel\nIII Endgame capital proposal. You ’ve gotten a lot of “ pushback” from people on different\naspects of the proposal , and you yourself expressed some reservations . And I’m just curious :\nCould you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, that proposal is out for comment. And we expect a lot of\ncomment . We won ’t get those comments until the end of, well , into next year . You know,\nwe’ve extended the deadline. And we ’ll take them seriously. We’ ll read them. I’ll say what ,\nwhat I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we ’re a consensus -driven organization.\nWe’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?\nCHAIR POWELL. It means broad support.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONN ELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So, in addition to persistence,\nwhen you look at long -term T reasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those\ntighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further\ntightening? Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So what do we look at ? We look at a very wide range of financial\nconditions and, in fact, as you’ ll know, different organizations publish different financial\nconditions ’ indexes , which can have , you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,\nso there ’s a very rich environment . And we tend to look at a few of them. I’m not going to give\nyou the names, but , you know, they’ re a few of the common ones that people look at. And so\nthey’ re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,\nthe credit spreads. S ometimes they ’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn ’t\nany one thing. We would never look at , for example, long -term T reasury rates in isolation , nor\nwould we ignore them. But we would look at them as part of a broader picture , and they do play\na role , of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes. Your second\nquestion was?\nJONN ELLE MARTE. On the banking stress.\nCHAIR POWELL. Banking stress —so it’s something we’ re watching . As you know,\nwe, we did have —there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in\nthe March —the things we went through in March and thereafter . And so we ’ve been working a\nlot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that\nthey have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized , losses that they have .\nAnd we do think the banking system is quite resilient . We had , you know, a handful of bank\nfailures but —so that ’s, that’s what we ’re out there doing. And we don ’t have any reason to think\nthat this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture , which is one of a strong\nbanking system and one where there ’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,\non funding, and those sorts of things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks , Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley from NPR. Last week you\nand your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for\ncomment . Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there —what it would mean for\nmerchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of both debit and credit cards in the —in the payment system ?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, s o you’ re right . We put a proposal out for comment , is\nwhat we did. And , you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us , as you, of course , know, in\nDodd- Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute . That’s, that’s all we ’re\ntrying to do. What else can we really do? It’ s a 90 -day comment period, and we typically don ’t\ncomment on these things once they ’re out for —out for comment . And we do hope that\nstakeholders —and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views. They\nhaven’ t been shy about that. So that ’s, that’s critical and that ’s, that’s what I can say about that\nnow.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. T hanks , Chair. Edward Lawrence with F ox\nBusiness. So for the last three months, the year -over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core\nwell over 3 percent. You ’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but\nwith no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus overall inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, t he, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and\nbe bumpy, but we ’re making progress. You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came\ndown by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter. So the best thing I could point you to would\nbe the September SEP where , you know, the expectation was that , that inflation by the end of\n\nnext year, on a 12- month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further\ninto the 2s. So that ’s, that’s —if you look historically, that ’s, that’s sort of consistent with the\nway inflation comes down. It does take some time, and as you get —you know, as you get\nfurther and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time. But the good news is, you\nknow, we ’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive. A nd we feel like we ’re on a\npath to make more progress , and it ’s essential that we do.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But you’ ve said in the past that doing too little on interest\nrates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed. How robust was the debate about this pause on the doing- too-little side?\nCHAIR POWELL. That ’s always the question we’ re asking ourselves. And we know\nthat, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get\nentrenched in the economy, and we know that that ’s really bad for people. Inflation will be both\nmore —both higher and more volatile . That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and , and so\nwe’re really committed to not letting that happen. You know, f or the first year or so of our\ntightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough. We’ re, you know, we’re —\nwe’ve come far enough that , that the risks , you know, have gotten more two sided. You can’ t\nidentify that with a lot of precision , but it does feel like the , the risks are more two sided now.\nAnd—but we ’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time , and we will.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVI TCH. Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist. Quick follow -up\nto the question about banking stresses —you talked about how the banking system is resilient . Of\ncourse , part of the resilience the past year stems from the B ank T erm F unding P rogram that you\nlaunched in March. Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are\n\nprobably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. Good question. W e haven ’t really —we haven’ t really been thinking\nabout that yet. We—you know, it’ s November 1, and that ’s a decision we ’ll be making in the\nfirst quarter of next year.\nSIMON RABINOVI TCH. Okay . Sorry. Quick second question about inflation\nexpectations —the U . Michigan sentiment s urvey showed a big jump in one -year-ahead inflation\nexpectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2. Last year you said that particular survey was a really\ndecisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions . If it stays elevated next time around, how big\nof an input will that be into your December thinking?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . We look at a range of , of things . I think the , the, the, you\nknow, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit . It was actually a preliminary\nestimate that got revised away . And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn ’t get picked up.\nSo we look at many, many things . So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also\nmarket- based estimates, and , you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between\nmeetings . And, you know, there ’s—it’s just cl ear that inflation expectations are in a good place .\nThe public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time, . And it will—\nthey’re right. So —and there ’s no real crack in that—in that armor. Y ou can always find one\nreading that is a little bit out of whack , but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the\npublic believes that inflation will come down . And that ’s, of course —we believe that ’s critical\nin winning the battle.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\n\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi , Chair Powell. Megan Cassella with Barron ’s. Thanks for\ntaking our questions. I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate. You mentioned\ntoday that you’ re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive , and you’ ve recently said\nthat evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now. So I was curious if you could\nelaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view , has risen.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah . So first thing to say is that it’ s very important . It’s a very\nimportant variable in , in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’ t identify it with\nany precision in real time. And we know that. So you have to just take that —you have to take\nyour estimate of it with a grain of salt. What we know now is , you know, within a range of\nestimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it ’s therefore putting downward pressure on\neconomic activity, hiring, and inflation. So we do—we do talk about this . There’s not any\ndebate or attempt to , you know, to sort of agree as a group on what —whether r * has moved or\nnot. Some people think it has, some people haven’ t said —that don’ t think it has. Ultimately , it’s\nunknowable, and so really again, what we ’re focused on is , you know, looking at the data and\ngiving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our\nmoves . Does it —does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down\nto 2 percent over time? That’s the question we ’re asking ourselves. I think , you know, years\nfrom now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.\nYou can’ t—we can ’t really wait for th at in making policy. We have to look—we have to have\nthose models and look at them and think about them , and, ultimately , we’ve got to look at the\neffects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes i t difficult.\n\nMEGAN CASSELLA. If I could follow up on a wages point . Earlier you talked about\nthe inflation outlook, but I ’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its\ncurrent level could be —could risk pushing up overall inflation or re -acceleration ?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , if you look at the —look at the broad range of wages, they have —\nwage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a\nlevel where they ’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent\ninflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time. So it ’s much\ncloser than it was. And that ’s true of the ECI, which is the one that ’s—the one that we got this\nweek . It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour , too. So —and all of them\nare kind of saying that, which is great. And you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading. So that ’s what you see. And so what\nyou saw with the ECI reading was , if you look back a couple —it comes out four times a year— if\nyou look back a couple of quarters, you’ ll see it was much higher , then it came down\nsubstantially in June . And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the\nJune reading . So, in a way, it ’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our\nexpectations internally , too. So I think we feel good about that. Also I would say it isn’ t—in my\nthinking, it ’s not the case that , that wages have been the princip al driver of inflation so far,\nalthough I think it ’s all—I do think it ’s fair to say that , as we go forward, as monetary policy\nbecomes more important relative to the supply- side issues I ’ve talked about in the unwinding of\nthe pandemic e ffects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time , too.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you\nare about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So , as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the\nconcern was not doing too, too—not doing enough. I t was not getting rates high enough in time\nto avoid having inflation expectations —higher inflation expectations become entrenched. S o\nthat was the concern. I think we ’ve reached , you know, now more than 18 months into this .\nYou can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we ’re still —we’re still —we’re still\ntrying to gain confidence in what the appropriate sta nce is. But you can see that . We think, and\nI think, that the risks are getting more balanced. I’ll just say that they ’re getting more balanced.\nThe risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting —are getting more —\ncloser to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent . That range, if\nyou take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’ re\ngoing to see that . You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well abo ve mainstream estimates\nof a neutral policy rate. Now that ’s arithmetic . It doesn’ t really —the proof is really in how the\neconomy reacts, but I would say that we ’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to\nbeing in balance.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Okay . And you said the proof is how the economy\nreacts. What are you looking at to be sure you’ re not overshooting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think what we ’re looking at is are we still— is inflation still\nbroadly cooling? Do we —is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where\ninflation was clearly cooling and coming down. Now we ’ve seen periods like that before, and\nthey’ ve just —there hasn’t been follow -through. T he data have bounced back. So what are we\n\nseeing? Are we seeing —is inflation still coming down? So that ’s the first thing. The second\nthing is , in the labor market , what we ’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and\ndemand, partly through just much more supply coming online . And with labor demand still\nclearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we ’ve had over the last\nquarter , it’s still very strong demand. So —and you see wage increases coming down as we\ndiscussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way. I think that ’s—we want to see that, that\nwhole set of processes continue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Bryan.\nBRYAN MENA. Bryan Mena, CNN. Do you think that there has been any structural\nchange in either consumption or in the job market that ’s pushing at consumption? You\nobviously saw the third- quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect\neveryone’s spending to have fizzled out by now . So I’m kind of wondering if there ’s been any\nstructural change in consumption.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t say there ’s been a structural change in consumption . I\nwould say it ’s certainly been strong. A nd so a couple of things . We may have underestimated\nthe balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it. There\nmay be —you know, we ’ve been , like everyone else, trying to estimate the number —the amount\nof savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’ t spend on services really\nat all, or in -person services. And , you know, there can still be more of that than we think,\nalthough at a certain point we have to—we ’re going to be getting back to pre -pandemic levels of\nsavings. We may not be there yet. So things are —clearly , people are still spending. The\ndynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than\ninflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises\n\nspending, which continues to drive more hiring. A nd so you’ ve had a really —that whole —that\nwhole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off , so that\ngoods availability, automobile availability is better —or was better, I think it still is . And, from a\nbusiness standpoint, there are more people to hire. And it is more labor supply. So the whole\nthing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing. And i t’s been —you know,\nit’s been good, and the thing is, we ’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.\nSo, it ’s been a dynamic . The question is , how long can that continue? And , you know, I just\nthink this —the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the\npandemic e ffects, that ’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we ’re still\nlearning . That took l onger for that process to begin than we thought, and we ’re still learning\nabout how it plays out. That’s all we can do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.\nDANIEL AVIS. Thank you, Chair Powell. I ’m Daniel Avis from Agence France -Press e.\nJust a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel –Hamas conflict.\nThe F ed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel –Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine\n“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained\ndisruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.” You ’ve had\norganizations at the W orld Bank warning of a possibl e surge in oil prices if the war spreads to\nother countries in the region. I ’m just wondering how the F ed is monitoring these developments\nin the Middle East —you mentioned they are —and just what the potential economic impact could\nbe if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’ t want to speculate too much, but I ’ll just say so —you\nknow, really the question there is , does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things\n\nlike affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we ’re talking about. The price of\noil has really not reacted very much so far to this. As the —you know , as the F ed—as the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and\neconomic e ffects. A nd it isn’ t clear , at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going\nto—is on track to have significant economic e ffects. That doesn ’t mean it isn ’t incredibly\nimportant and something for p eople to , you know, to take really important notice of, but it may\nor may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an\neconomic body. Bu t—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “ calls out ” risks . And\nthat’s what it ’s doing— [it] is calling out a risk of that .\nAnd the war in Ukraine, the same. The w ar in Ukraine did have , immediately , very\nsignificant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.\nSo, thank you. Thanks very much."
