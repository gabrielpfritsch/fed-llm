  "text": "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Good afternoon.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two -day meeting earlier today. Based\non its review of recent economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the economy\ncontinuing to grow at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the strong headwinds created by current\nfederal fiscal policies.\nThe labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment\naveraging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months. Job gains, along with the\nstrengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to increases in consumer confidence and\nsupported household spending. However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long -term unemployment. Overall, the Committee\nbelieves the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market have diminished since the fall, but we will continue to evaluate economic conditions and risks as they evolve.\nInflation has been running below the Committee ’s longer -run objective of 2 percent for\nsome time and has been a bit softer recently. The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors , and with longer -term inflation expectations remaining stable,\nthe Committee expects inflation to move back towards this 2 percent longer -term objective over\ntime. We will, however, be closely monitori ng these developments as well.\nIn conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the\n7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted individual economic\nprojections. As always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of\nappropriate monetary policy. Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards levels of\n\nunemployment and infl ation consistent with the Federal Reserve ’s statutory mandate to foster\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nIn brief , participants ’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to\n2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent i n 2015. The central tendency of their\nprojections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent,\ndeclining to 5.8 to 6.2 percent in the quarter of 2015. Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee ’s longer -run objective; the\ncentral tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 perce nt for this year and 1.6 to\n2.0 percent for 2015.\nBefore turning to today ’s policy decision, let me say a few wo rds about the Federal\nReserve’ s strategy for normalizing policy in the long run . In the minutes of its June 2011\nmeeting, the Committee set forth principles that it intended to follow when the time came to normalize policy and the size and the structure of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet . As part of\nprudent planning, we have been reviewing these principles in recent meetings . We expect those\ndiscussions to continue and intend to provide further information at an appropriate time . For\ntoday, I will n ote that, in the view of most participants, the broad principles set out in June 2011\nremain applicable. One difference is worth mentioning . While participants continue to think\nthat, in the long run, the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio should consist predom inantly of Treasury\nsecurities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage -\nbacked securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or elimina te residual MBS holdings . I emphasize that,\ngiven the outlook and the Committee ’s policy guidance, these matters are unlikely to be relevant\nto actual policy for quite a while .\n\nLet me turn now to current policy issues . With unemployment still elevated and inflation\nbelow the Committee ’s longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly\naccommodative policies . As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy\nby lowering the target for the short -term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot meaningfully be\nreduced further . Thus, we are providing policy accommodation through two alternative\nmethods : first, by communicating to the public the Committee ’s plans for setting the federal\nfunds rate target over the medium term, and , second , by purchasing and holding Treasury\nsecurities and agency mortgage -backed securities . Let me discuss a few key points regarding\neach of these two policy tools .\nFirst, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low\nrange for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the\nsenses described in the FOMC statement . As I have noted frequently, the phrase “ at least as\nlong” in the Committee ’s interest rate guidance is important. T he economic conditions we have\nset out as preceding any future rate i ncrease are thresholds, not triggers . For example, assuming\nthat inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase . All else equal, the more subdued the\noutlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would likely be in making that\nassessment . In the projections submitted for this meeting, FOMC participants indicated\nthat they expect the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate to occur in 2015, and one\n\nexpected the first increase to incur in 2016. Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of\nmaximum employment, inflation remains near our longer -run objective, and inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they\nbegin, ar e likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee ’s balanced approach to meeting its\nemployment and price stability objectives .\nThe purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses\nthat monetary policy will continu e to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth\nand job creation picks up. Importantly, as our statement notes, the Committee expects a\nconsiderable interval of time to pass between when the Committee will cease adding\naccommodation through asset purchases and the time when the Committee will begin to reduce\naccommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels .\nThe second policy tool being employed by the Committee is asset purchases .\nSpecifically, the Committee has been purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage -\nbacked securities and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities . When our program of asset\npurchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability and noted it\nwould also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program . Today the\nCommittee made no changes to the purchase program .\nAlthough the Comm ittee left the pace of purchases unchanged at today ’s meeting, it has\nstated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve . Any such change\nwould reflect the incoming data and their implications for the outlook, as well as the cumul ative\nprogress made toward the Committee ’s objectives since the program began in September . Going\nforward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains\n\nin labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as\nthe near -term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes . We also see inflation\nmoving back toward our 2 percent objective over time . If the incoming data are broadly\nconsistent with this forecast, the Co mmittee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to\nmoderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year . And if the subsequent data remain\nbroadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear . In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment\nrate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program .\nI would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined\nand will depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the\ncumulative progress toward our objectives . If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace\nof asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly . If the outlook becomes less\nfavorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged to be inconsistent with further progress in the labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed. Indeed,\nshould it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability .\nIt’s also worth noting here that, even if a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases\noccurs, we would not be shrinking the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio of securities , but only slowing\nthe pace at which we are adding to the portfolio while continuing to reinvest principal payments\n\nand proceeds from maturing holdings as well . These large and growing holdings will continue to\nput downward pressure on longer -term interest rates . To use the analogy of driving an\nautomobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal\nas the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes .\nI will close by drawing again the important distinction between the Committee ’s\ndecisions about adjusting the pace of asset purchases and its forward guidance regarding the target for the federal funds rate. As I mentioned, the current level of the federal funds rate target\nis likely to remain appropriate for a considerable period after asset purchases are concluded . To\nreturn to the driving analogy, if the incoming data support the view that the economy is able to sustain a reasonable cruising speed, we will ease the pressure on the accelerator by gradually reducing the pace of purchases . However, any need to consider applying the brakes by raising\nshort -term rates is still far in the future . In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the\nFederal Reserve remains committed to fostering substantial improvement in the outlook for the\nlabor market in a context of price stability.\nThank you. I’d be glad to take your questions .\nSTEVE LIESMAN . Steve Liesman with CNBC . I hate to use my question to ask you to\nclarify something, but when you said gradually reduce purchases, beginning later this year and ending it next year when the unemployment rate hits 7 percent —what is that? Is that a decision\nby the FOMC? Is that an intention that —\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . That is —we had a good discussion of that issue today , and\nwe haven ’t had —obviously , there’ s no change, there’ s no change in policy involved here, there ’s\nsimply a clarification, helping people to think about where polic y will evolve . So, it was thought\nthat it might be best for me to explain that to this group and answer questions . Future policy\n\nstatements may include elements of this , but it ’s not a policy change . I’m just trying to explain\nhow are —how we ’re making a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , how\nwe’re making that concrete , and how we ’re thinking about the potential future of the program\ngiven alternative policy and economic developments.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . So there is no consensus on t hat? That ’s not a vote of the FOMC,\nthat’s not a plan that ’s written down some place or —?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . It represents the consensus of the FOMC, yes.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . If you could just —the question I was going to ask was , could you\ngive us some infor mation on “ substantial improvement ”? Is that the unemployment rate coming\ndown by itself to 7 percent , or are there other factors involved, and is it “ substantial ” compared\nto the fall? Is that when —\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, there are many factors that we look at when t rying to\njudge the state of the labor market . As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of\nother data , but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we ’d like to\nmake in order to be able to say that we ’ve reach ed substantial progress.\nJON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal . Mr . Chairman,\nthere’ s an undercurrent of optimism in your forecast and your statement —in the policy statement\ntoday . For instance, the unemployment rate forecast comes down to 6.5 to 6.8 percent next year .\nIt’s the case that the Fed has overestimated the economy ’s growth rate very often in the past\nduring this recovery, so —and we ’ve gone through a period in the first half of the year with pretty\nsubdued growth. So I would like to hear you explain where this optimism comes from and how\nconfident you are that these expectations are going to be met.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us . In\nparticular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis , is now,\nobviously, a support to growth. It’s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise,\nincreased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment . State and\nlocal governments , who have been a major drag , are now coming to a position where they no\nlonger have to lay off large numbers of workers . Generally speaking, financial conditions are\nimproving . The main drag , or the main headwind , to growth this year is , as you know, is the\nfederal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1 ½ percentage points\nof growth. And our judgment is that, you know, given that very heavy headwind, the fact that\nthe economy is still moving ahead at at least a moderate pace, is indicative that the underlying\nfactors are improving . And so we ’ll see how that evolves . Obviously, we haven’ t seen the full\neffect yet of the fiscal policy changes ; we’ll want to see how that evolves as we get through that\nfiscal impact . But we ’re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections —and again,\nthese are individual projections, not an official forecast of the C ommittee —we ’ll be obviously\nvery interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate. I think one thing that ’s very important for me to say is that, if you draw the\nconclusion that I ’ve just said , that our policies —that our purchases will end in the middle of next\nyear, you ’ve drawn the wrong conclus ion because our purchases are tied to what happens in the\neconomy . And if the Federal Reserve makes the same error and we overestimate what ’s\nhappening, then our policies will adjust to that . We are not —we have no deterministic or fixed\nplan. Rather, our policies are going to depend on this scenario coming true . If it doesn’ t come\ntrue, we ’ll adjust our policies to that.\n\nALISTER BULL . Alister Bull from Reuters . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Financial\nconditions have tightened in the last few weeks and bond yields have gone up, and they ’ve gone\nup again today . Why do you think that is? And could you talk a little bit about whether that rise\nin bond yields and interest —longer -term interest rates could affect your economic outlook and,\nparticularly , given that mortgage rates are now back up above 4 percent , if that could affect the\nrecovery under way in the housing market?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, that ’s a good question. Yes, rates have come up\nsome . That ’s in part due to more optimism , I think , about the economy . It’s in part due to\nperceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecast —the projections that our participants submitted\nfor this meeting , of course , were done in the last few days , so they were done with full\nknowledge of what had happened to financial conditions . Rates have tightened some, but, you\nknow, other factors ha ve been more positive —increasing house prices , for example . I think as\nfar as the housing market is concerned, we ’re going to want to watch that , but one important\ndifference now is that people are more optimistic about housing . They expect house prices to\ncontinue to rise , and we see that , for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey . And\nthat, you know, compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate . And , in fact, in\nterms of monthly payments on an average house, the change in mortgage rates we ’ve seen so far\nis not all that dramatic . So, yes, our forecast —our projections do factor that in, and if interest\nrates go up for the right rea sons—that is , both optimism about the economy and an accurate\nassessment of monetary policy —that ’s a good thing . That ’s not a bad thing.\nROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times . Mr. Chairman, you ’ve\nalways argued that it ’s the stock of ass ets that the Federal Reserve holds which affects long -term\ninterest rates . How do you reconcile that with a very sharp rise in real interest rates that we’ ve\n\nseen in recent weeks? And do you think the market is correctly interpreting what you think is\nmost likely to be the future path of the Federal Reserve’ s stock of assets? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, we were a little puzzled by that. It was bigger than\ncan be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable\nranges . So I think we have to conclude that there are other factors at work as well , including ,\nagain, some optimism about the economy, maybe some uncertainty arising . So, I ’m agreeing\nwith you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy .\nIt’s difficult to judge whether the markets are in sync or not . Generally speaking though,\nI think that what I ’ve seen from analyst s and market participants is not wildly different from\nwhat, you know, the C ommittee is thinking and trying to—as I try today to communicate . I think\nthe most important thing that I just want to convey , again , is that it’ s important not to say “ this\ndate, that date, this time, ” it’s important to understand that our policies are economic dependent\nand, in particular , if financial conditions move in a way that make this economic scenario\nunlikely , for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy .\nYLAN MUI . Thanks . Ylan Mui, Washington Post . On Monday, President Obama said\nin an interview that he believe d that you had stayed in your position as chairman for longer than\nyou wanted to and maybe longer than you were supposed to. Do you agree with that assessment of your term , and can you update us on any conversations you’ ve had with him about your\nfuture?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, Ylan, we just spent two days working on monetary\npolicy issues , and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the questions here on policy . I\ndon’t have anything for you on my personal plans .\n\nCRAIG TORRES . Greetings , Mr. Chairman . Craig Torres from Bloomberg . I’d like to\npush for a little deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Sure.\nCRAIG TORRES . The forecast and the mysterious dots kind of don’ t map into the\nunemployment forecast . We see more -gradual rate rise going out into time . People moving to\nthe right, at least one person, on when they expect the rate to increase, and yet, unemployment ’s\ngoing to fall to 6.5 percent in 2014. I also note that labor force participation isn ’t in that great\nshape, and you, in fact , have been a big believer that a lot of the exit from the workforce is\nrelated to weak demand, not structural factors . So here is my question. Can you explain a little\nbit more —you know —mayb e is the threshold too high? And I ’ll point out that the V ice C hair\nand two other people who used to work here have done significant research on, maybe you need\nto let the employment rate fall much lower to pull these people back into the labor force . So I’m\nwondering if you can expand on that .\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, it’ s a great question and —but the —what you pointed\nout, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is ,\nremember, the 6½ percent is a threshold, not a trigger . In other words, when we get to that point,\nwe will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate ,\nand among the things we would take into account , first of all , is inflation, and infla tion obviously\nis very low and expected to stay low . Secondly, we would be taking into account , does that\nunemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market ? And, as you\npointed out, we have underemployment , part -time work, pe ople leaving the labor force, reduced\nparticipation, long- term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe th e\n6.5 percent is a little bit—not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point .\n\nSo, first of all, since it is a threshold and not a trigger, we ’re entirely free to take all that into\naccount before we begin the process of raising rates , and that ’s what the diagram suggests .\nPeople are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or early 2015, but the y’re saying\nthat increases in rates may not follow but several quarters after that . In terms of adjusting the\nthreshold, I think that ’s something that might happen . If it did happen, it would be to lower it,\nI’m sure , not to raise it.\nBINYAMIN APPE LBAUM . Bin ya Appelbaum, New York Times . Following up on that,\nso I understand the 6.5 percent is a threshold, but you’ ve just talked about a 7 percent line for\nasset purchases . That sounded less like a threshold than like a target . You said if you ’re at about\nthat level , you’ll stop with the asset purchases mid next year . You talked about wanting to see\nsubstantial improvement in the labor market before you did suspend those purchases . It’s very\neasy to imagine a situation in which we get to 7 percent w ithout seeing labor force participation\nincrease. The employment rate ’s been at the same level for three years now . Has something\nchanged in your thinking about the value of asset purchases? W hy are you cutting them off\nbefore you see that “ substantial improvement ”?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, “ substantial ” is in the eye of the beholder . I think\ngoing from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic\ngrowth is a substantial increase. I think it ’s important to explain that, you know, we view\nourselves as having two tools . One of them is rate policy , and that includes both setting the rate\nand providing guidance about future rates . That ’s our basic tool, that ’s the one that the Federal\nReserve and other central banks h ave used forever . Asset purchases are a different kind of thing .\nThey ’re unconventional policy, they come with certain risks and certain uncertainties that are not\nnecessarily associated with rate policy . So our intent from the beginning , as I’ve been very clear ,\n\nwas to use asset purchases as a way of achieving some near -term momentum to get the economy\nmoving forward into a sustainable recovery . And then, essentially , to allow the low interest rate\npolicy which—to carry us through. So what I —so let me just make two, I think, very important\npoints . The first is, our target is not 7, it ’s not 6½, our target is maximum employment, which ,\naccording to our projections , most people on the C ommittee think is somewhere between 5 and\n6 percent unemployment , and that ’s where we’ re trying to get to . The 7, the 6½—these are\nguide posts that tell you how we ’re going to be shifting the mix of our tools as we try to land th is\nship on a, you know, on a —in a smooth way onto the aircraft carrier . The —sorry. So, the other\nthing I wanted to say was that stopping asset purchases, when that happens , and I think we ’re\nstill some distance from that happening , but when that happens, that won’ t involve ending the\nstimulus from asset purchases because we’ re going to hold on t o that portfolio. And if the stock\ntheory of the portfolio is correct , which we believe it is, holding all of those securities off of the\nmarket and reinvesting and still keeping the , you know, rolling -over maturing securities, w ill still\ncontinue to put downward pressure on interest rates . And so, between our commitments to a low\nfederal funds rate and the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of\nstimulus —in our view , enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without\nincurring unnecessary costs or risks.\nVICTORIA McGRANE . Hi, Chairman. Victoria McGrane with Dow Jones Newswires .\nYou, in your statement be fore the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that\ninflation readings have been low . But you maintain that inflation expect—longer -term inflation\nexpectations have remained stable. But actually, certain bond market measures of these things\nhave fallen in recent weeks . Is that of any concern , and if not, why? What would you need to\n\nsee for the C ommittee to start being more concerned that longer -term inflation expectations are ,\nin fact, falling?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, this is something we watch very carefully . There are\na number of, as I mentioned in th e statement, there are a num ber of transitory factors that may be\ncontributing to the very low inflation rate . For example, the effects of the sequester on medical\npayments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now . So these are some\nthings that we expect to reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit . But, first, on\ninflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation -adjusted —inflation -\nindex ed bonds have come down. To this point, they still remain within the historical range that\nwe’ve seen over the past few years . And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations , be\nit forecast s by professional forecasters, whether it ’s survey measures from firms or households,\nthose are all still pretty much in the same places they we re.\nNow that being said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we don ’t take anything for\ngranted . And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin ,\nat least gradually , to return towards our 2 percent objective . If that doesn ’t happen, we will\nobviously have to take some measures to address that . And we are certainly determined to keep\ninflation not only —we want to keep inflation near its objective , not only avoiding inflation that ’s\ntoo high, but we also want to avoid inflation that ’s too low.\nPETER COOK . Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television. Given the\nvolatility we ’ve seen in the market since your comments of May 22nd, the lengths to which you\nare stressing the forward guidance here today, it doe s suggest that there are some out there\nyou’re worried are not getting your message right now . And I ’m wondering, to what extent do\n\nyou think now that your exit strategy is going to be that much more challengin g because even in\nthis small period of time w hen you haven ’t done all that much, you’ ve seen this kind of reaction?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, it is important for us to communicate . It’s\nparticularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard\nrelationships are not applying in the way they have , where we ’re using unconventional tools,\nwhere we’ re using forward guidance . So, I guess I agree with you that our communication is\ngoing to be very important . We hope that the —again, the key point I ’ve tried to make today is\nthat our policies are tied to how the outlook evolves . And that should provide some comfort to\nmarkets because they will understand, I hope, that we will be providing whatever support is necessary . If the economy does not improve along the lines that we expect, we’ ll provide\nadditional support . If financial conditions evolve in a way that ’s inconsistent with economic\nrecovery, we will provide support . But we ’re hope —and in that way, we hope to increase\nconfidence both among market participants , but also among investors and private consumers and\nother people in the economy . So, but again, I mean, your point is well taken that we are in a\nposition where the simple adjustment by 25 bas is points to the federal funds rate seems like a\nlong-ago exper ience, and we are in a more complex type of situation . But we are determined to\nbe as clear as we can , and we hope that you and your listeners and the markets will all be able to\nfollow what we ’re saying.\nDONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with American Banker . Next month will be the three -\nyear anniversary of the Dodd–Frank Act , and , as you know, there are a number of significant\nrulemakings that have left to be finalized : the Volcker r ule, prudential regulations under s ection\n165 and 166, and risk retention, to name a few . Can you provide us with an update on where we\n\nstand with the rulemakings? And also, are you still optimistic that we will see these rules\ncompleted by the end of this year?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . It’s certainly true that it’ s taken time to do these\nregulations . There are a number of reasons for that . The first is that the y are, inherently , many\nof them, quite complicated . The Volcker r ule, for example, involves some very subtle\ndistinctions between hedging and market ma king and proprietary trading . The second reason is\nthat many of them involve multiple agencies , which have to coordinate, cooperate , and agree on\nlanguage . I think the QRM rule is , six agencies are involved in making that rule . And the third\nfact—the th ird and basic issue is that we really have to do our homework. We have to get these\nright , and that means having extended comment periods, getting lots of information from the\npublic . And then, you know, reviewing those comments and doing all we can to m ake sure\nwe’re responsive to those many, many concerns and suggestions . So it does take time . I think\nit’s a little unfair to say, “Well, only 30 percent of the rules have been completed,” because most\nof the rules , even if they haven ’t been completed , are now very far advanced , and that ’s true for\nthe major rules . We are very close, for example, to completing Basel III . We have made a good\nbit of progress on the Volcker r ule, and I do anticipate that being done this year . We are making\nadditional pr ogress on our 165, 166 advisory rules on the capital surcharges . These are all things\nthat will be coming relatively soon, at least during, you know, the current year . And of course,\nonce they are out there, then it will still take some time to be implemented , for financial\ninstitutions to change their practices , and so on—and so on. I would also emphasize , though,\nthat, even as this is going on, that we are not ignoring the health and safety of the banking\nsystem . For example, I mean, since 2009, we ’ve been doing these very rigorous stress test s,\nwhich are part of the Dodd –Frank rules . And the amount of capital that U .S. banks hold has\n\nroughly doubled—the largest banks —since 2009. And indeed, the largest banks now appear ,\nmost of them , either to be Basel III –compliant or pretty close to Basel III –compliant . So we are\nworking with the banks to ensure their safety, to help them move in the directions that they know\nthey’re going to have to be going even as the rules themselves are being finalized . So, it’ s an\nongoing process , but I expect to see, you know, more -rapid completion, you know, going\nforward in the next few quarters.\nPETER BARNES . Peter Barnes, Fox Business . Sir, one of the highlights of the Kansas\nCity Fed conference in Jackson Hole every year are remarks by the Chairman, you . You’re not\ngoing this year . We ’ve heard it ’s because you have a conflict in your personal schedule . But\nsome have read —taken that as a sign that you may not be staying on the job for another term .\nCould you comment on that? And could you offer us —give us a little more explanation as to\nwhy you ’re not going to be in Jackson Hole for the first time?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as I ’ve said, I ’m not going to comment on my\npersonal plans , but I will say this . I think t here’ s a perception that the Jackson Hole conference\nis a F ederal R eserve S ystemwide conference. It’s not . It’s a conference sponsored by one of the\n12 R eserve Banks. Every one of the 12 R eserve Banks has conferences, has meetings, and this is\nthe one I ’ve gone to the most of probably any of the R eserve Banks, so I think it ’s not\ninappropriate to go to different conferences, different meetings , and to essentially meet all the\nconstituents that I have in these different R eserve Banks. So that ’s one reaso n, certainly.\nSTEVE BECKNER . Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman. A number of your\ncolleagues , as reflected in the new SEP projections , expect the unemployment rate to get down to\n6½ percent next year , which is your threshold for considering raising the f unds rate . And yet the\nFOMC has also said that it expects to keep rates very accommodative for a considerable time\n\nafter asset purchases and after the recovery has strengthened . And yet here we are, the middle of\n2013, you’ ve not even begun to scale back asset purchases . So, I mean, you’ve partially\naddress ed this. But, you know, could there be a conflict between, on the one hand, the asset\npurchase program, on the other hand, the funds rate guidance policy . Could they conflict?\nCould you perhaps elaborate?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down\nso fast that this becomes a problem . I guess I would point out a couple of things . One is that , of\ncourse, you know, there ’s a range of estimates , and they ’re all based on each individual ’s idea of\noptimal policy , so the policy assumptions may not be the same . So it ’s true that some are as low\nas 6.5, but as I said in my earlier answer, that ’s a threshold, not a trigger . So, evidently , if you,\nyou know, look at the policy expectations that are given in the dot diagram, you’ ll see that the\nvery strong majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be quite low at the end of 2015.\nSo that ’s not inconsistent, that ’s just saying that people are looking at a variety o f factors ,\nincluding inflation , which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in\nthinking about when it ’ll be appropriate to start increasing rates.\nSCOTT SPOERRY . Thank you, Sir . Scott Spoerry from CNN, CNNMoney . Well, first\nof all, I should tell you that your analogy to landing the economy on an aircraft carrier worried me a little bit because , from personal experience, I find that it ’s always a little bit jarring to land\non an aircraft carrier . But I wanted to talk ab out mortgage -backed securities . You mentioned\nduring your comments here that , if I understood correctly, that you’ re not going to dispose of the\nmortgage -backed securities that you have on the book during this period of normalization. A nd\nI’ve heard many people on Wall Street and elsewhere say that right now the Federal Reserve is\nthe market for mortgage -backed securities , and so —which means that it’ s kind of a warped\n\nmarket right now . And I’m just wondering , how focused are you on mortgage -backed securi ties\nand this larger world market , which —what used to be a world market for mortgage -backed\nsecurities . And I guess —I guess what I ’m saying, has the ground shifted from under us in terms\nof the mortgage -backed security world on a permanent basis , or at le ast for a very long -term\nbasis , because of the devastating nature of what happened a few years ago?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of\nmortgage -backed securities , but, more relevant , as part of our assessment —of our ongoing\nassessment of the potential cost s of our various asset purchase programs , we pay very close\nattention to market functioning . And our assessment is that the MBS market is still quite a\nhealthy market in terms of the spreads, in terms of execut ion times, in terms of the number of\npeople on both sides of the market . You know, there are REITs now that are building up their\nMBS portfolios . The re are plenty of real -money investors holding MBS . So, you know, if the\nmarket was really breaking down in some way that would be a fact or we’d have to take into\naccount . But our assessment —and , of course , we’re in that market quite a bit, s o we have a lot\nof information about it —our assessment is that that market is still working quite well, and that\nour purchases are not disrupting the normal price discovery and liquidity functions of that\nmarket . I think that the events of five years ago, obviously , do have a big long -term effect .\nThere are bills in Congress that would change , reform the GSEs , for example, and ultimately\nwould change the market for mortgage -backed securities, perhaps increasing the amount of\nprivate placements or changing the whole institutional structure of that market. So, we may end up holding some securities , which are in some sense left over from a previous era at some point .\nBut nevertheless, you know, for the time being, they are the mortgage -backed securit ies\nmarket — Fannie and Freddie are basically it —and we are, of course , legally allowed to buy and\n\nown those securit ies. And so, we have found it useful to do that , and we believe it ’s contributed\nto lower mortgage rates and a stronger housing market . So that ’s been our rationale . And just ,\nagain, to come back to your question, we do not see any significant deteriora tion in market\nfunctioning . If there are things that you can point us to, we would be obviously very interested.\nSCOTT SPOERRY. Well, let me just follow up with just one thing . In terms of the\ngovernment backing through the GSEs of mortgage -backed secur ities, is there a concern, a\nlegitimate concern that without government backing of this market in some way , that because the\nprivate market is —seems to move with much more rapidity than government backing and\ngovernment purchases, that moving the government out of this backup role on mortgage -backed\nsecurities would be a real problem or really change the nature of getting a mortgage in America.\nSome people say, you know, if the government wasn’ t behind it, it would mean the end of the\n30-year mort gage as we know it.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, these issues are being debated . There are some— a\nnumber of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases ,\nor would place them with backstop government support, as opposed to 100 percent government\ncredit guarantees . So these are debates that we’ re all having about the future of the U .S.\nmortgage market . I think it ’s entirely possible that if there ’s major change in the government ’s\nrole in the mortgage market that we might see a different structure in mortgages . And, you\nknow, other countries have different structures , and they have , in many cases , the same or similar\nhome ownership rates as we do, s o it’s possible that we may find that a different structure is\nbetter for s ome people .\nGREG ROBB . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com . I was\nwondering if you could go back over your —what you said about the plans for tapering later this\n\nyear. And why isn ’t tapering a tightening? It seems that many people in the markets just as soon\nas you talk taper —will taper —are just going to push forward when you—they think that first rate\nhike will come . Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, as I tr ied to explain in my opening remarks, our pla ns\ndepend on the economic scenario and how it evolves . And what I tr ied to do is explain how our\nasset purchases would evolve if , sort of , the modal, the most likely forecast , were to , in fact , take\nplace, which , of cou rse, it won ’t exactly take place, s omething else will no doubt happen. But\nagain, our basic forecast is one which is basically , as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a\nmoderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks up as we pass through this period of fiscal\nrestraint; where un employment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last\nSeptember —and we have made som e progress since last September ; and inflation rises slowly\ntowards 2 percent . Those are the conditions that define this sort of baseline forecast . In that case\nthen, as I described it, we would expect probably to slow or moderate purchases some time later\nthis year, and then through the middle of —through the early part of next year , and ending , in that\nscenario , somewhere in the middle of the year . Aga in though, it ’s very important to understand\nthat that’ s—if we do that, that would basically say that , you know , that we ’ve had a relatively\ndecent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment . If\nthings are worse, we would do more . If things are better, we will do less .\nI think I would—to answer your other question— I would draw the analogy: If the\nFederal Reserve in normal times lowers the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , but some\ntraders think that —were expecting 50 basis points, then there might be a sense that the financial\nconditions have tightened somewhat . But nevertheless, I think you would say that if the Fed cut\nthe funds rate by 25 basis points , that that was an easing of policy . And, by the same t oken, as\n\nlong as we ’re buying assets , we are adding to our holdings . We do believe —although, you\nknow, there ’s room for debate —we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through\nthe stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets , and the prices of\nthose assets have to adju st to balance supply and demand. A nd we ’ve taken out some of the\nsupply , and so the prices go up, the yields go down. So, that , seems to me , consistent with the\nidea that we’ re still adding liquidity , we’re still adding accommodation to the system.\nRYAN AVENT . Ryan Avent, The Economist .\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Hi.\nRYAN AVENT . Mr. Chairman, I ’m trying to sort of understand the view with rela tion to\nthese inflation figures . I’m a little surprised at how , I guess , blasé the C ommittee seems about\nthem , with the exception of President Bullard. Inflation looks remarkably low on both core and\nheadline, PCE and CPI . Your projections have it at —rising , the core PC E rising , to at most\n2 percent in 2015. You say that inflation expectations have remained sort of within the range\nthat the Fed has traditionally been comfortable with , but they have fallen by a good ½ percentage\npoint . And , as y ou know , that when interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, a decline in\ninflation expectations sort of translates into an increase in real rates . Why is the Fed not more\nconcerned about this? It seem s to me that earlier in the recovery, they were more concerned\nabout declines in inflation like this . And wouldn’ t you say that , even if you ’re happy with the\npace of labor market recovery, th at, other things equal, this sort of inflation performance\nsuggest s that you should be pushing harder on the acceler ator.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . I don’ t disagree with anything you said . I think low —\ninflation that’ s too low is a problem . It increases the risk of deflation . It raises real interest rates .\nIt means that debt de leveraging takes place more slowly . Now, there ’s always issues about, you\n\nknow, why is it low? And , as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that\nmeaningful economically —for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the\ntemporary movements in nonmarket prices, thi ngs of that sort . I mean, after all , the CPI is\nsomewhat higher . And so we expect inflation to come back up, that ’s our forecast . But I don’ t\nwant —I think it ’s entirely wrong to say we ’re not concerned about it . We are concerned about\nit. W e would like to get inflation up to our target , and that will be a factor in our thinking about\nthe thresholds . It will be a factor in our thinking about asset purchases . And, you know, we ’ve\ngot a dual mandate, and it ’s maximum employment and price stability . And there’ s a reason why\nwe define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to\nbest maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is , in fact, you know,\nsome room for real interest rates to move . So, I don’ t disagree with your basic argument .\nKEVIN HALL . Thanks, Mr. Chairman, Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers . Since\nyou’ve referred to Mr. Hilsenrath, is he the real power behind the throne? That’s one of the\nquestions we all have .\nYou had mentioned on several occasions now that quantitative easing is designed to kind\nof spur economic —drive down the yields , force more risk -taking that flows through the\neconomy . There had been debate a couple of years ago at the beg inning of this about whether it\nwas inflating commodity prices . Inflation as a whole is subdued, but oil prices are —anchor ed\nsomewhere around $99—$93 to $99. We were told on ce we have domestic production —we\nhave record production now —that th at would be a signal to bring prices down. It hasn ’t\nhappened. Brazil has got people on the streets be cause of inflation. To what degree do you think\nquantitative easing is actually inflating commodity prices , and have you been able to filter that\n\nout? And any thoughts on wage grow th and why that ’s been so flat when everything else seems\nto be doing good in the economy?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, when we —as I recall, I believe I have this right —\nwhen we introduced the second round of LSAPs , properly known as QE2, in , I think, November\n2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time , and there was a lot of\ncomplaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices , and that that ’s a negative for people\naround the world. And we argued at the time that the effect s of the Federal Reserve’ s policy on\nglobal commodity prices was probably pr etty small , and that it operated —to the extent it did\nhave an effect —it operated through growth—mos tly through growth expectations . That is , a\nstronger global economy tends to dri ve up commodity prices .\nThis time around, we ’ve purchased , and are in the process of purchasi ng, a lot more than\nwe did in so- called QE2 . We haven ’t really seen much increase in commodity prices .\nCommodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year. Oil is a little bit different from\nothers in that it ’s kind of hung up. But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the\nreason I would give for that is that the emerging markets —China, the rest of Asia , and some\nother parts of the worl d—plus Europe , of course , are softer , and so global commodity demand is\nweaker . And that explains , I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much.\nSo I think that ’s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on com modity\nprices —I’m not saying it’s zero, but I don ’t think that it’ s nearly as bi g as some folks have\nsuggested.\nIn terms of wages, I think that ’s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment , at\n7.6 percent , is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied . Maximum employment, we\nthink, is , again , between 5 and 6 percent , although these are very difficult numbers to estimate .\n\nSo, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupation s, is indicative\nto me of a labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies , I think—\ntogether with low inflation —justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative policy.\nKATE DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico . The S EC’s money\nmarket fund proposal is far less comprehensive than the plan that you and the Financial Stability\nOversight C ouncil endorsed. Do you think FSOC should defer to the S EC or still press for more\nto be done?\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I ’m very glad to see that the S EC has taken up money\nmarket reform . It is by far the best outcome for the S EC to do it . It’s the area where they have\nthe expertise and where they have the experience. In terms of their actual proposal they ’ve put\nout—of course , it’s just a proposal for comment —one of their two proposals, the floating NAV,\nthe floating net asset value, is , of course , qualitatively similar to that —one of the proposals that\nwas in the FSOC suggestions . We have not yet reviewed this in enough detail to give a view .\nBut I hope that —I think —I know for sure that by putting out a floating NAV proposal that\nthey’re moving in the right direction. And I ’m hopeful that what comes out will be something\nthat’s sufficient to meet the very important need of stabilizing the money market funds.\nAKIO FUJII . I’m Akio Fujii, Nikkei Newspaper . Thank you, Chairman . Recently , we\nhave seen great volatility in Japanese market —equity, JGB , and foreign exchange . Some say\nthis volatility is due to un certainty to the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy direction , but other s\nsay this is due to lack of confidence to the Bank of Japan ’s monetary policy . So how do you\nview the Bank of Japan’ s efforts? Do you still support Bank of Japan policy? And other\nquestion is , how much do you pay attention to the spillover effect to the international market\nwhen you consider exit strategy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well, I think the volatility is mostly linked to the Bank of\nJapan ’s efforts , and that would seem logical , since in earlier episodes , when the Fed was doing\nasset purchases and the BOJ was not doing an ything, there was no volatility . So it sort of seems\nlogical that the change here is the change in BOJ policy .\nThe BOJ is fighting against a very difficult , entrenched deflation. And , of course,\ndeflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years , which means that expectations are\nvery much —the public ’s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very\naggressive policies to break those expectations and to get inflation up to the 2 percent target that\nthe Bank of Japan has set .\nSo that ’s why it ’s difficult, they ’ve had to be very aggressive . That aggressiveness in the\nearly stages of this process , where investors are still learn ing about the BOJ ’s reaction function,\nit’s not all that surprising that there ’s volatility . Also, the JGB markets are less liquid than , say,\nthe T reasury market , for example. So I —you know, I think that ’s something they need to pay\nclose attention to , but, on the whole, I think that it is important for Japan to attack deflation. And\nI also agree with the “ three arrows, ” the idea that besides breaking deflation , it’s important to\naddress fiscal and structural issues as well . So, I ’m supportive of my c olleague , Mr. Kuroda, and\nI’m supportive of what Japan is doing , even though it does have some effects on our economy as\nwell.\nThe—there are a lot of reasons why emerging markets and other countries experience\ncapital inflows and volatility . Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations .\nFor example, we ’ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently .\nSome of it has to do with risk- on, risk- off behavior , and some of it probably does have to do with\nmonetary policy in advanced economies , which include s, of course , the United States . We do\n\ntake it —pay attention to that . I frequently meet with colleagues from emerging markets at the\nG-20, for example, and we discuss these issues . I think the right way to think about it is that, as\nthe G -7 and the G -20 both have noted, that what U .S. monetary policy , like that of Japan , is\ntrying to do is trying to help this economy grow . And a global recovery, a global —strong global\ngrowth depends very much on the U .S. growing at a reasonable rate. And so, while there is some\neffect, I think the net effect , including a stronger U .S. economy , is, on the whole , positive, and I\nthink most of my colleagues in emerging markets recognize that . That being said , anything we\ncan do through communication or other means to try to minimize any overflow effects or side\neffects, we will certainly do.\nMARK HAMRICK. Hello Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com . You\nknow, you ’ve talked about being i n uncharted territory with policy , and we can remember that\nthese news conferences just bega n about two years ago as well , and so there ’s that mix of\ncommunication and policy . Insofar as the FOMC decided not to include the information a bout\nadjusting the asset purchases today, how do you walk that fine line ? And why did the FOMC\ndecide essentially to leave it to you to describe that, as opposed to putting it down in its own words? Thank you.\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE . Well , again, we don ’t think of this as a change in policy .\nWhat I was deputized to do, if you will, was to try to make somewhat clearer the implications of our existing policy and to try to explain better how the policy would evolve in various economic scenarios , and that ’s a little bit difficult to put into, you know, a very terse FOMC statement .\nNow that being said , going forward, I think that, yo u know, some of these elements, to the extent\nthat we can make them useful , will begin to appear in the FOMC statement . It’s enti rely\npossible . But it seemed like the right tactic in this case to explain these fairly subtle\n\ncontingencies in a context where I could answer questions and respond to any misunderstandings\nthat might occur.\nThank you."
