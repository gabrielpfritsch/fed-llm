  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. The pandemic continues to cause tremendous\nhuman and economic hardship here in the Unit ed States and around the world. The most\nimportant response to this public health crisis has come from our health -care workers, and we\nremain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk\nday after day in service to others and to our country. All of us have a role to play in our nation ’s\nresponse to the pandemic. At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the\nrecovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.\nIn recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen. Many\nbusinesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to\nengage in various activities. As a result , household spending looks to have recovered about half\nof its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much\nless of a pickup. The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus\npayments and expanded unemployment benefits , which provided substantial and timely support\nto household incomes. In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery. Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activi ty remains\nwell below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record.\nThe labor market has followed a similar pattern. After precipitous drops in March and\nApril, employment rose s trongly in May and June as many people returned to work from\ntemporary layoffs. As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one -third\nhad been regained as of the June payroll report. The unemployment rate declined in May and\n\nJune but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the\npeak during the Global F inancial C risis. In addition, t he downturn has not fallen equally on all\nAmericans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the most affected. In particular, the\nrise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers, for women, and for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics. This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives\nand created great uncertainty about the future .\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. For some goods, including\nfood, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income. More broadly, however, w eaker demand, especially in sectors —\nsuch as travel and hospitality —that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down\nconsumer prices, and , overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective.\nAlong with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges. After\ndeclining gradually from a peak near the end of April, the number of COVID -19 cases has\nincreased sharply in many parts of the country since mid -June. We have thus entered a new\nphase in containing the virus, whic h is essential to protect both our health and our economy. As\nwe have emphasized throughout the pandemic, t he path forward for the economy is\nextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check. Indeed, we have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the\nrenewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity. For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since\nlate June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses. A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’ s safe to\nreengage in a broad range of activities.\n\nThe path forward will also depend on policy actions taken at all levels of government to\nprovide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed. The Federal Reserve ’s response\nto this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable\nprices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the\nfinancial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. We have held our policy rate nea r zero since mid -March and have stated\nthat we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. We’ve been\npurchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities in order to\nsupport orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broade r financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency\nmortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace. These purchases are also fostering more\naccommodative financial conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly\nsupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small , and for\nstate and local governments. Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes. Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job losses and income losses and worsening the downturn. Preserving the flow of\ncredit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promot ing the recovery.\nMany of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the\nTreasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances , such as those we find\nourselves in today. These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not\n\notherwise available. In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs\nappear to have significantly increased the extension of credit from private lenders. We are\ndeploying these lending powe rs to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial\nbacking and support from Congress and the Treasury. We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery. This week we extended these programs through the end of the year. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will\nput these emergency tools back in the toolbox.\nAs I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed\ncannot grant money to particul ar beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with\nbroad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will\nbe repaid. Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these\ncases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and\nto make decisions about where we, as a society, should di rect our collective resources. T he\nfiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,\nbusinesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity\nand employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support\nfrom both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\nBefore taking your questions, I ’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy\nframework. [Clears throat] Excuse me. As a reminder, we began this public review of our\nmonetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices —a first for the Federal Reserve—\nearly last year. Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our\n\nmaximum -employment and price -stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of\nthe generally lower level of interest rates around the world. As is evident in our current\nsituation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the\neconomy by cutting interest rates. Our plans to conclude this review were, like so many things,\ndelayed by the pandemic. At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions. Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary\nPolicy Strategy. This doc ument states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy,\nand serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions. While I do not have any\ndetails to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progr ess and will\nwrap up our deliberations in the near future.\nWe understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to\nusing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from\nthis difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I will look forward to your\nquestions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. James Politi .\nJAMES POLITI. Hi there . James Politi with the F inancial Times . Chair Powell, the Fed\ntoday decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the\nworld. Why was that important for the Fed ? And how concerned are you about dollar shortages\npersisting over time through the pandemic?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, s o our —our dollar swap lines —we introduced those back at\nthe beginning of —of this episode after the pandemic made itself present. And dollar funding\nmarkets were in very difficult shape at the time. And the introduction of the swap lines has\n\nreally restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity. And\nso they kind of served their purpose. But we extended them —I guess , yesterday morning —\nreally to facilitate planning b y other central banks and just so people will know that those\nfacilities are still there.\nWe want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed. And since,\nyou know, the crisis and the economic fallout from —from the pandemic are far from over, we ’re\ngoing to leave those in place for the time being. And we ’ll leave them in place until we ’re\nconfident that they ’re no longer needed. There ’s nothing that ’s going on in the market right now\nthat raises any concerns. It’ s just , we want th em to be there as a backstop for markets.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Steve Lie sman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. I hope that you can hear me. Mr.\nChairman, given—you’ ve said several times now that you have lending , not spending, powers.\nGiven that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really , barely used, do\nyou think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is now saying that money is limited and they\nshouldn’t take —they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill? Is this money doing the best\nfor the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don ’t seem to be being used all\nthat much right now? Thank you. A nd I have a follow -up, sir.\nCHAIR POWELL. So they—that —that’s really a question for Congress. They —they\nappropriated that money, and—$454 billion for our facilities, and it ’s really a question for them.\nSo you’ re right that our facilities have not —we haven ’t done as much lending as we thought.\nBut, in very substantial measure, that ’s because markets started working again fairly soon after\n\nwe announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni —in the\nmuni space, and also in the short -term funding facilities —the three of those that we set up. So\nwe didn’ t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would.\nOn the other hand, it ’s important that the facilities stay in place , and that ’s why w e\nextended them yesterday. It’s important that they still stay in place until we ’re, you know, very\nconfident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us. So I—I\ncan’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it ’s important that the facilities be\nthere and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road. We don ’t see them now, but ,\nin case they do arise, they should be there.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Has any consideration —thank you. Has any consideration been\ngiven to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Not th at I’m aware of, no.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timira os. [No response] Nick, are you there?\n[No response]\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER. [Aside] I didn’t hear you say that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to David Gura, NBC.\nDAVID GURA. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. No doubt you were paying\nattention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from —from lawmakers. A nd a question they each answered had to do with the\ncontinuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits. And something we ’ve heard a lot is that\nthey could be a disincentive to work. Both of them addressed that. I wonder if you would\nas well.\n\nAnd then, as a follow -up, I wonder what you’ ve learned about the degree to which this\nhas led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are\nexperiencing two different kinds of —of pandemics here. Some are getting through this based on\nwhat they’ ve saved and the jobs that they have. Others are really struggling to get by . And I\nwonder what role —what additional role the Fed could have in, sort of , bridging that —that\nyawning gap.\nCHAIR POWELL. So , on your first question, I wouldn’ t want to be giving very detailed,\nspecific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing. I just will say the following, that, you know, this —this pandemic and its fallout really represents\nthe biggest shock to the U .S. economy in living memory. We went from the lowest levels of\nunemployment we ’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we ’ve had in 90 years , and we did it in\nthe space of two months . And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was\nstrong, it was fast, it was broad—and appropriately so. And I think we are seeing the results of\nthe earlier strong fiscal actions .\nWhen you see the spending that ’s happening, when you see small businesses staying in\nbusiness even though the economy hasn’ t fully , successfully , sustainably reopened yet in many\nplaces, you are seeing what happens with that —that money. And so, in —in a broad sense, it ’s\nbeen well spent . It’s kept people in their homes . It’s kept businesses in business. A nd that ’s all\na good thing . I think , in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more\nsupport from us and from more fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is up to Congress . You see the\nongoing discussions that they ’re having. And it suggests to me that there ’s—you know, that\nboth sides, they’ re wrangling over —over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is\na need for some additional fiscal support .\n\nAnd the last thing I ’ll say is that if the expansion —even if —sorry . Even if the reopening\ngoes well and many, many people go back to work, it ’s still going to take a fairly long time for\nthe parts of the economy that are —that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity.\nAnd that me ans that many of the people who were laid off from those industries —and that ’s\nrestaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and\naccommodation—m any of those people are going to find it hard to go back—t hey can’ t go back\nto their old job. There won’ t be enough jobs for them . So I think those people are going to need\nsupport . I can ’t say what the exact level should be . It’s not our role . But they ’re going to need\nsupport if they’ re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their\ncurrent rental house or— or apartment or a house if they own it . So I think there will be a need.\nIn terms of inequality , really —so I think it ’s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic\nhave fallen on, heav ily—they’ ve fallen on everyone, but they’ ve fallen very heavily on people\nwho work in the service industries in relatively low -paying jobs . So there was a—a figure that\ncame out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, the n\n40 percent —you had a 40 percent chance of losing your job in April and May. So it ’s falling\nvery heavily on—on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that .\nAnd that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women. So that ’s just what the\npandemic is doing.\nYou know, in terms of what we ’re doing, what we ’re trying to do is create an\nenvironment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to t heir old job or to a new job. That ’s really what\nwe’re doing. Everything we do is directed at that .\n\nAnd, you know, the —I would say—I would say one last thing on inequality. That is ,\ninequality is a—is an issue —has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for\nfour decades . And you see it —it has many faces. You see it in the relative flattening -out of —of\nincomes for people in low and—lower and middle income s as compared to those at the top. You\nsee it in low mobility where people —where the chances of moving up from the bottom to the\nmiddle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy\ncountries . So it ’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it ’s—it’s got underlying\ncauses that are not rela ted to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic .\nAgain, four decades of evidence suggests it ’s about globalization. I t’s about the\nflattening -out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor\ncountries . It’s about technology advancing, too. If you ’re on the wrong side of those forces, it ’s\nbeen —your income has stagnated. So it ’s—it’s a critical, critical problem for our society , but\none that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies . Our part of it is to —is to push as\nhard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability. We saw what\nhappened to people at —at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion. It\nwas the best labor market in 50 years, they told u s. We saw that the biggest wage increases were\ngoing to people at the bottom end of the —of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years of\nthat 10 -year, 8- month expansion. So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed\ncan foster to —to go after that —that problem , which is a —a serious one.\nMICHELLE SMITH . And now , Nick Timir aos.\nNICK TIMIRAOS . Yeah . [Inaudible] Journal. Chair Powell, you have described your\nasset purchase objective as stabilizing markets. And with markets having stabilized, aren ’t the\nasset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your\n\nmacroeconomic objectives? The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with\nrespect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL . So you’ re right, the asset purchases in —in their current size really\nsprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic . And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not\nfully , but substantially restored functioning markets . This is absolutely critical. That market is\nreally one of the —it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial mar kets, and it ’s—it’s\nessential that it —that it work well, and it is doing so now .\nAnd we ’ve always said , though, that we understand, accept , and are fine with the fact\nthat—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary poli cy,\nwhich would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes . So it ’s doing both, and— and, you\nknow, we ’ve understood that for some time . It’s not —the programs are not structured exactly\nlike the —the QE programs were in the last —in the last financial —in the aftermath of the last\nfinancial crisis. Those were more focused on buying longer -run securities. The current\npurchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum . Nonetheless, they are supporting\naccommodative financial conditions . I think it ’s—it’s clear that that’ s the case.\nIn terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen. We—as you know,\nwe’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our\ncurrent stance of policy . We do feel that our curren t monetary policy stance is the appropriate\none. You know, we cut rates close t o zero right at the beginning. W e—we ramped up asset\npurchases, and those —those have really helped. And we gave forward guidance on— on both of\nthose things , which the markets appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with\n\nthose . So we think we’re —we think that our —our policy stance is a good one . We’re, of\ncourse , prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to —to\nbetter foste r achievement of our goals , of course .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Jeanna .\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. T hank you for taking my question. You talked\nto Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April , and May , according to your public calendars. I was\nwondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about , and, if the topic of those\nconversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of\ninterest during those conversations?\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, so —so BlackRock is just our agent . You know, we make the\npolicy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues , and they just execute our —our plans . I\nactually don ’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about , but he’s a—you\nknow, he ’s the h ead of a major service provider . He generally checks in to find out whether\nwe’re okay with the quality of the service that —that BlackRock is providing. I don’ t have the\ndaily face -to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or —or, as you can see, three\nphone calls in the course of a few months . It wasn ’t very many.\nSo I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual\narrangements we have with them . And, again, I would have —I—I can ’t recall exactly what\nthose c onversations were, but they were —they would have been about what are you seeing in the\nmarkets and things like that too—you know, generally exchanging information. And he ’s—he’s\ntypically trying to make sure that—that we are getting good service from the company that he\nfounded and leads . That’s —I’d say that ’s his main objective when we talk.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay, thank you. We’ll go to Scott Horsle y.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY . Thank you, Mr . Chairman . Scott Horsl ey from NPR . I wonder if\nyou can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month\nand what, if anything, that tells us about the , sort of , economic circulatory system .\nCHAIR POWELL . Yes. So—the situation with coins is that the—the quantity of coins\nis going up but was adequate before the pandemic . The problem is , the circulation kind of\nstopped because stores were closed, banks were closed . It just—customers weren ’t spending,\nthey were —so the coins stopped moving in the system . So we ’ve been working for —ever since\nthat began to happen, we saw it happening right away. We’ve been working to try to —try to\nreverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins . So we ’re\nworking with the U.S. Mint , which is the issuing authority , to address the issue. Just last week,\nthe M int—you may have seen —issued a statement asking for the public ’s help in keeping coins\ncirculating, a nd various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation.\nWe also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders —you know, banks and, you\nknow, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions , everybody in the —in the coin\nsupply chain . We’re in frequent communication with the banks and with the —with the armored\ncarriers tryin g to get back to where we need to be . So we do think the inventories are building\nup. You know, the M int—the Mint is making coins as fast as they can, but —but , you know,\nthings happen with —in the factory environment : Someone will come to work with COVID —I\nthink this has happened in —in almost every factory environment around the country —and then\nthey’ ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing. So —so we’re\nclosely monitoring it . It’s —you know, it ’s a significant issue. We’ve—we’ve got a lot of\nresources on it , and we do feel like we’ re—we’re making progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay, thank you. Rachel Siegel .\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL . Hey, Chair Powell . Thank you for taking my question. I ’m\nwondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double -dip\nrecession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stall ing, compared to some of\nthe signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer . Thanks very much.\nCHAIR POWELL . Yeah . So maybe I ’ll talk more broadly about the —the outlook and\ninclude your —include your question in it . So, as I mentioned, economic activity and\nemployment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their\nlevels because, I ’d say , job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and\nApril, a nd consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop. So —but , nonetheless, those\nwere —those were sooner and stronger than we expecte d. So —but what happened then was ,\nalong with that positive data, we got —we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in\nlots and lots of states around the country. And that brings us to a new —a new point here , which\nis, we need to —in addition to dealing with the health crisis —we have to remember , this is really\na health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus , and it’s taking a terrible toll,\nso we ’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that .\nSo what we ’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we —what we think of as sort\nof nonstandard, high- frequency data . That ’s become a very important thing, even more\nimportant than usual in the work that we do. And what that data show , on balance , is that the\npace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June. So some\nmeasures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.\nRecent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, partic ularly among smaller\nbusinesses. Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out . People aren ’t going out to restaurants,\nbars, gas stations, pharmacies , and beauty salons as much. Consumer surveys, by the way,\n\nwhich had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply—\nthey look like they may be softening again now .\nThere are still some areas of strength . Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been\nstrong. Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowi ng in the pace of the\nrecovery. But I want to stress, it ’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained\nit will be . We just don ’t know yet, because we have to wait for —to see the, you know, the actual\ndata on spending and employment com e in, and —but this —this is what we ’re seeing, and , of\ncourse , we’re monitoring it very carefully .\nAnd I ’d be remiss in not stressing this enough. The path of the economy is going to\ndepend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep\nit in check . That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now . The two things\nare not in conflict. You know, social -distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy,\nthey actually go together . They ’re not in competition with each other. So —\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Chris Ruga ber.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi . Well, just to follow up on that a bit —and thanks for\ntaking my question—you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy\ndepends on the path of the virus . Is this —do you feel this idea , or this view , is not widely\nenough understood? Do you feel —you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an\nincautious reopening might harm the economy. Do you feel that message was not heard , and that\nsome of these reopenings took place perhaps sooner than they should have?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I think we feel that it —it might be , the most central fact\nor the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus . And you’ re seeing\nthat again now . You saw that in the —during the lockdown when we got cases way down, a nd\n\nyou saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up. And now that\nthe—that the cases have spiked again —again , the early data, the high -frequency data suggest\nthat there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now . We don ’t know how deep or how long\nthat will be . So it’s such an important sentence . We just decided that it needed to be in our —in\nour postmeeting st atement . It’s so fundamental . And, you know, I think we can’ t say it enough.\nIt’s—it’s really important.\nWe’re —you know, you can think of it as three stages. There ’s the lockdown, and we\nknow what that looks like, and we ’ll get the data , I guess , later this week on GDP being down\nvery historically large amounts . Then there was the reopening, a nd we would expect that many,\nmany people would go back to work. Those w hose jobs could be done without —you know,\nwithout exposure to lots of people in tight groups , they should have been —they should be able to\ngo back to work during that phase fairly quickly . But that would depend on being able to keep\nthe virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social -distancing\nmeasures. So that ’s where we are. It’s such an important factor . It’s—it’s in—we ’re all talking\nabout it , so we thought it really had to be in the statement.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Mike McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE . Mr. Chairman, I ’m wondering what it is —you ’ve talked a lot\nabout using all of your tools , and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to\naccommodation—w hat it is you can actually do. Y ou’ve lowered rates to zero . Yo u’ve set up\nthe lending programs . There hasn ’t been much take -up. And the tools you talk about are\ngenerally in service of keeping interest rates low , where they already are. So unless you were to\ngo to negative interest rates, I ’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed can bring.\n\nOr is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to —to add\nadditional help for it?\nCHAIR POWELL . Right . So you’ re right. We are committed to using our full ra nge of\ntools to support the U.S. economy at this difficult time , and we will always remain committed in\nthat sense. We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our\ncredit and liquidity facilities , which are effectively unlim ited. We can adjust those programs.\nWe also can adjust our forward guidance. We can adjust our asset purchases. So there are things\nthat we can do . We—we feel like we have the ability to do more .\nBut I would not disagree with the —with the importance o f fiscal policy —with your\nstatement about the importance of fiscal policy . Fiscal policy can do—can address things that\nwe can ’t address. I f there are particular groups that need help , that need direct monetary help—\nnot a loan, but an actual grant as the PPP program showed— you can save a lot of businesses and\na lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer .\nThe company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can’ t work because\nthere ’s no business . So lending is a particular tool , and we ’re using it very aggressively.\nBut fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say , again, Congress ’s action early in the\npandemic —historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S.\nstandards—i t’s really helping now . It’s really helping . It’s going to stand up very well to—to\nscrutiny down the years . This Congress ’s very fa st and very open- handed response, I think, has\nreally helped . And I think—I know that, as I ’ve said, ver y likely more will be needed from —\nfrom all of us, a nd I see Congress negotiating now over —over a new package , and I think that ’s\na good thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay. Edward Lawrence.\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. So you\ntalked about it several times today : The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy\nis linked to the path of the virus . It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October\nor toward s the end of the year . Has the C ommittee talked about how that might change Fed\npolicies? And , as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it\nto be? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So we —of course , the concept of vaccines comes up in our\ndiscussions . Of co urse it does . But I have to say, you know, we’re —our job is not to plan for\nthe upside case, right? The upside case—we ’ve got that covered. Our job is to plan for all —the\nfull range of things that could happen. And so we ’re assuming —we ’re going to cont inue to\nassume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed , and that the public needs —you\nknow, needs the support that we ’re giving the public until —until shown otherwise . There ’s great\nuncertainty around the development of therapeutics a nd vaccines . All of us want them to happen\nas soon as possible, but we can ’t plan on that . We’ve got to hope for the worst —hope for the\n[laughs ]—hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes .\nIn terms of inflation, I don ’t know . I mean, I —you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a\ndisinflationary shock. I know there —there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to\ninflation over time , but, you know, we ’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the\nworld going into this . Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to\n1 percent . And I do think for quite some time we ’re going to be struggling against\ndisinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Ann Sa phir.\n\nANN SAPHIR. Hi . Yes, thanks for taking my question. So , I mean, as you monitor the\nrising infections and the slowing pace of the recover y, could you speak to , what would the\ntrigger be for doing further easing? And on the flip side of that, whe n would it be reasonable to\nexpect the Fed to consider raising rates again? Thanks .\nCHAIR POWELL . So, you know, as we ’ve said, we’ re carefully monitoring the\nsituation . We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, an d we ’ve been monitoring the\nsituation. And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a\ngood place . But we ’ve looked at —at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we ’re\nready to do that when we think it ’s appropriate . I can ’t give you a specific trigger . It really just\nis when we think it would help: Would it help more than what we ’re doing now to foster\nmaximum employment and stable prices?\nSorry, your second question was? [ Inaudible ] I can ’t hear you . Say it again?\nANN SAPHIR. Sorry —for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider\nraising —\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh.\nANN SAPHIR. —rates again.\nCHAIR POWELL . So as I —as I said earlier , or a while back, we ’re not even thinking\nabout —thinking about raising rates. We’re—we’ re totally focused on providing the economy\nthe support that it will need . We think that the economy will need highly accommodative\nmonetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period. And we ’re absolutely\ncommitted to staying in this until —until we ’re very confident that that is no longer needed. So I\nwouldn’ t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that\nfor a very long time . We’re—we’re in this until —until we’re well through it.\n\nAnd I think this —you know, I think the picture is , you have the —you have the lockdown,\nthen you have the reopening. But there ’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number\nof people are struggling to get back to work because those —those heavily affected areas of the\neconomy are going to be challenged , really , to employ the millions of people who are now out of\nwork . I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something\nlike that. So that ’s going to take a while , I think , in everyone ’s reckoning. And I just —everyone\nshould know that we ’re going to be there for all of that.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Cata rina with Bloomberg .\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair . Thanks for taking our questions . You mentioned\nearlier that the labor mark et we had in February was the best we’ ve had in 50 years, yet at that\npoint the B lack unemployment rate was still double that of whites . So I wanted to ask you, you\nknow, we ’ve seen some economists and even the Biden campaign call for the Fed to more\nspecifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates . Even if you don’ t get a\nmandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going\nforward? And how would you do that?\nAnd then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm ’s writings from\nlast night. She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed —described harassment\nand professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to. Is this your F ederal R eserve?\nCHAIR POWELL . Okay . So, first, on the unemployment, you’ re right . And we always\npoint this out in our —in our remarks. While the aggr egate unemployment rate was 3 ½ percent ,\nevery —every economy —every market in every economy has longer -run issues . And one of ours\nis just the disparate level of unemployment between —between Blacks and whites. And it ’s\ngenerally sort of twice as much —twice as high for B lacks. So even—but this was the lowest,\n\nyou know, B lack unemployment rate in 50 years —or, actually , sinc e we started keeping records,\nwhich was less than 50 years ago . So that ’s just a fact , and it ’s—it’s not a good fact, you know.\nSo we have started , though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on\ndisparate levels of unemployment —for example, among—among different racial groups and\ndemographic groups . We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions. We call\nthem out in testim ony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress . You ’ll\nsee it everywhere, i n all the things that we do.\nSo what does that mean? I think —you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor\nmarket really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income\nspectrum generally . But it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years —it took sort of the\n8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits . So we need more than that .\nThat’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there. So we ’re—we’re going to get\nback there as fast as we can , because that ’s what we can do , but society more broadly can affect\nthese things . You know, we don’ t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate\noutcomes as well as fiscal policy . And just policy general ly—education, health care, all those\nthings are much better at doing that.\nIn terms of—so we do—you will see that —you will see that discussed —the B lack\nunemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do. And I think we clearly understand now that it’ s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market . It’s something that you want to\nbe focused on and weigh. So it is very much in our thinking —again, in a world where we don’ t\nreally have the best tools to address that . So, something that we ’re doing.\nSo I have not seen that —I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it\nto me . We, of course , have been in meetings until just before this . So, but —and I will take a\n\nlook at it . I will do that. And, you know, I —without having had a chance to think about it, read\nit, understand it, I ’ll just say a couple things . First, I think it’ s fair to acknowledge that there ’s\nbeen a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the\nworkplace —not just among econom ists, but among economists and at the Fed . That ’s been\ngoing on for far too long . And , you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have\ndone more and—and should have done more .\nI would say, though, that we —you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as\ndiverse and inclusive an organization as we can . And I think we ’ve made a lot of progress on\nthat. I think we want a place where it ’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people\ncan disagree but must do so respectfully. I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that . And I —my experience has been, you know, from my\ncareer in business too, is that organizations —the really successful organizations in our society\nget this . They do. Th ey—mostly , they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is\nwhat you—you’ re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce ,\nso—and workplace . So we ’ve made diversity a priority .\nWe actually —you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession . We had\nthe—the two heads of the AEA task force on this —who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and\nJanet Yellen —come here, and I cohosted a—an event with them , I guess , last year or the year\nbefore , which had several hundred— 500 people or something like that listening in about —about\nthese issues. So we ’re doing a lot . I’m sure we can do more . We’re doing a lot to— you know,\nto foster a respectful climate—particularly for women , but for —for all people . So it ’s—it’s a\nvery high priority for us as an organization. I will look into —into that and —when I —you know,\nwhen this is over.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Okay, thank you. Don Lee .\nDON LEE . Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and\nnew hi ring activity has weakened . I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate\nrising and job growth turning negative this summer?\nCHAIR POWELL . So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we ’re watching this high -\nfrequency data . And , of course , the offi cial labor market reports come out once a month , and no\none has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’ re going to say. They ’ve been, in\nMay and June , stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May. So I would say, some\nhumility is ap propriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going. I\nthink all we can say today is that there ’s—there’s evidence in the high -frequency data, the\nsurveys , and , you know, you’ re tracking —you get pictures of spending. You get pic tures of\npeople ’s movements . And what we —it looks like we ’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of\ngrowth. That’s —and that might be —it might be short lived, it might not be, you know . And it\nseems to be related to —and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in\nthe middle of June .\nNow, I really don’ t want to get ahead of where the data are on this. So we ’re just going\nto have to see . We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that\nquestion. And r ecent experience suggests we— we need to wait and see . In any case, there ’s\nclearly a risk that we ’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and\nin hiring. It might still be at a robust level. Honestly, we —we will not know unt il we start to see\nmore data come in.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Victoria Guida .\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico . Thanks for taking my questio n.\nI wanted to ask about the 13( 3) facilities . You all have used your emergency authority to buy\nassets that you can ’t directly buy, like corporate bonds, ETF s. So I was just wondering, what is\nthe scope of your authority under 13( 3)? What type of assets are you allowed to buy? Could\nyou buy equities through an SPV , for example?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, we haven’ t—we haven’t looked at that , and we have\nno—no intention . We haven ’t done any work or thought about buying equities . But , you know,\nwe—we ’re bound by the —by the provisions of 13( 3), which requires that we make, you know,\nfacilities —programs or facilities of broad applicability, m eaning we have to have —it can ’t just\nbe focused on one entity. You know, it has to be a broad group of entities .\nThere ’s a lot in 13( 3) about —about the solvency of the borrowers . You know,\nremember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that\nwas—that was to —meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions . That’s —\nthere was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and\nthings like that . So, you know, we have to meet those requirements. You know, we haven’ t\nlooked and said —tried to say , “W hat can we buy ?” and, you know, “ Let’s make a complete list .”\nYou know, we felt that , using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and\nmunicipal bonds , too. So —\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So I just— sorry, just to follow up really quickly. So is it— is it\ngenerally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments , since you talked about\nborrowers?\nCHAIR POWELL. The statute doesn ’t say that, but , yeah, you could read the statute that\nway if you want . Honestly, we haven’ t tried to push it to, you know, what ’s the theoretical limit\n\nof it. I mean, I think, clearly , it’s—it’s supposed to—it’s supposed to replace lending, you know .\nThat’s—that’s really what you ’re doing. You ’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the\nmarket has stopped functioning. That ’s fundamentally what you’ re doing with 13( 3). And —and\nso I think you’ ve got to —you’ve got to sort of work within that framework.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Greg Rob b.\nGREG ROBB. Hi . Thanks for taking my question. Greg Robb from Market Watch . Can\nyou hear me? Okay. One of the things in this crisis that ’s unusual is that companies are cuttin g\nwages and salaries, and that ’s something, you know, we haven’ t seen much . And I was\nwondering what the Fed is thinking about this . It—it seems to indicate that inflation could be\nmore volatile in coming—coming months and coming years.\nCHAIR POWELL . Well, I— I think that the main thing that tells you is that the —the\nlabor market has a long way to go to recover . You know, we had a good labor market . It wasn ’t\nperfect . There were always issues. There are always going to be issues within an economy . Bu t\nthe labor market really has a long way to go now . Even with two very strong months of job\ncreation —7½ million jobs between the two months —we still have 14 million people\nunemployed . So it ’s just —it’ s a long way to go. And as—and that leads to a situation where\nthere are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened. So\nthere aren ’t, you know —until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can go\nback to work, but —so it’s a tough situation.\nAnd I’ve re ad reports of that . You know, of course , the reported wages went up because\nof the composition effect —you know, it’s low -paid workers didn’ t go back to work, so—they\nwere the ones that got laid off —so average hourly earnings went up. But clearly, clearly the\npressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate\n\nlevel here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work . And the\nmain —so it just underscores again the —the urgency of doing everythi ng we can to restore the\nlabor force and—and to support those who are —who want to be in the labor force but whose\njobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster .\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Jean Y ung.\nJEAN YUNG . Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about forward\nguidance . Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes? And would\nyou consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes? A nd\nspecifically , for the labor market , what conditions would you want to see before you think about\npulling back stimulus ? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL . So that ’s a great discussion that we—we ’ve talked about that at past\nmeetings, and I imagine we will at fu ture meetings and haven ’t made any decisions yet on that .\nBut, you know, you’ ve got a couple ways to go. You can tie —you can tie them to dates . You\ncan say we will —for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level. Or you can say\nwe’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal . And it can either be\ninflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out .\nAnd I think that, you know, there ’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I\nthink, for obvious reasons. You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’ d really\nwant to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes . It’s also the case, though, that sometimes—\nsometimes date -based guidance works too . I think it really is very fact specific, and it ’s not\nsomething we ’ve—you know, we haven’ t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’ t be standing\nhere telling you we ’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us\nto—to change our forward guidance.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you. Ha nnah.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell . Thanks for doing this today. I wanted to ask, on\nthe stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they ’ve said that they’ re weighing\nwhether to revise the Collins A mendment in order to ease the tier 1 lever age ratio for banks . Are\nyou concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed ’s stress test s showed\nthat, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery , that several banks would approach\nthe regulatory minimum capital requirem ents?\nCHAIR POWELL . So—okay. So I think what the stress tests showed is that , under the\n“regular way” stress test, the banks passed . But right in the middle of the —of the stress test\ncame the pandemic. And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios , which were, you know,\nreally bad scenarios. And many of the banks passed, but some didn’ t. So we —and that was\ndone very quickly. S o we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can —that says there ’s\nbeen a material change, and we ’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans . We also\nstopped buybacks —share buybacks and limited dividends . So we ’re working through the details\nof how all of that will work . I think we ’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the —the\nstress scenarios on S eptember 30th . So, I would say, that ’s—you know, that —that process is\nworking that way.\nAnd—but you’ re making a connection to it, to the Collins A mendment fix. So what ’s\ngoing on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we\nfound is that our —we have found our banks are strong. They ’re strongly capitalized , with lots of\nliquidity . And they’ ve really been a source of strength in this —in this crisis so far . And they’ ve\nwritten off bad loans and things like that . The y’re still well capitalized and strong and will be , I\nthink, a source of strength in this situation.\n\nSo—but what —what we did earlier was , we—what happens is , the banks run up against\ntheir leverage ratio, which is a non- risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the\nbalance sheet . So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks , and they reached the limit of\nhow—how much they could grow or made loans —you know, they—companies drew down\nloans and deposited cash . So we gave some leverage ratio reli ef earlier by temporarily —it’ s\ntemporary relief —by eliminating, temporarily , Treasuries from the calculation of the —of the\nleverage ratio . This is a—this is another additional thing to do . If Congress chooses to do this,\nwe would want it to be explicitly temporary . We —in other words, this will not be a permanent\nchange in capital standards .\nWe haven ’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their\nbalance sheet and , in doing so, to serve their customers better . And , you know, I have to tell\nyou, if you look around the world, bank regulators —many, many bank regulators around the\nworld have given leverage ratio relief . You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the\nEuropean Commission did, the Bank of Canada di d, we did. It’s—it’s not, it’s not —what it ’s\ndoing is , it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers .\nThat—that ’s really what it’ s doing. And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if —if\nwe do do it.\nMIC HELLE SMITH . Okay, thank you. We’ll go to Brian Ch eung for the last question.\nBRIAN CH EUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell . Thanks so much. Brian Ch eung with Yahoo\nFinance . I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your\ndiscussion on explicit forward guidance . So is the idea that you’ re trying to have some order to\nthat, that you would announce the findings of the Fed review before then committing to some\nsort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy? Thanks .\n\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, so I do think that completion of the review would—first\nof all, it ’s something that was a very high priority for—we were really looking forward to\ncompleting it , probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that . We\nwere right on track, and then we got distracted. I —and we weren ’t expecting the pandemic, of\ncourse . Nobody was . So the pandemic came in . I think it is important to go back and f inish\nthat, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward.\nI would also tell you, though, that , to—to a very large extent , the—the changes we ’ll\nmake to the S tatement of [on] Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy are rea lly\ncodifying the way we ’re already acting with our policies . To a large extent, we’ re already doing\nthe things that are —that are in there . This is just a way of —of acknowledging that and putting\nthem in the document . I can ’t tell you what the exact tim ing of that will be, but I do think that ’s\na—that’s a sensible way to think about it . Thanks very much.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Thank you very much."
