  "text": "December 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ½ to\n¾ percent. In doing so, my colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the\neconomy has made toward our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Over the past year, 2 ¼ million net new jobs have been created, unemployment has fallen fu rther,\nand inflation has moved closer to our longer -run goal of 2 percent. We expect the economy will\ncontinue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next couple of years. I ’ll have more to s ay about monetary policy shortly, but\nfirst I ’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook.\nEconomic growth has picked up since the middle of the year. Household spending\ncontinues to rise at a moderate pace, supported by income gains and by rel atively high levels of\nconsumer sentiment and wealth. Business investment, however, remains soft despite some stabilization in the energy sector. Overall, we expect the economy will expand at a moderate\npace over the next few years.\nJob gains averaged ne arly 180,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the\nsolid pace that we ’ve seen since the beginning of the year. Over the past seven years, since the\ndepths of the Great Recession, more than 15 million jobs have been added to the U.S. econom y.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 2007, prior to the recession. Broader measures of labor market slack have also moved lower, and participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about t wo years now, a further sign of\nimproved conditions in the labor market given the underlying downward trend in participation\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nstemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population. Looking ahead, w e expect that job\nconditions will strengthen somewhat furt her.\nTurning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures was nearly 1 ½ percent in October, still short of our 2 percent objective but up more\nthan a percentage point from a year earlier. Core inflation—which excludes energy and food\nprices that tend to be more volatile than other prices —has risen to 1¾ percent. As the transitory\ninfluences of earlier declines in energy prices and prices of imports continue to fade and as the job market strengthens further, we expect overall inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next\ncouple of years.\nOur inflation outlook rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well anchored. Market -based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up considerably but are still low. Survey -based measures of longer -\nrun inflation expectations are, on balance, little changed. Of course, we remain committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward this goal.\nLet me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by\nCommittee participants. As always, they conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of\nthe multitude of factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rises from 1.9 percent this year to 2.1 percent in 2017 and stays close to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate. The median\nprojection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year.\nOver the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs at 4.5 pe rcent, modestly below the\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nmedian estimate of its longer -run normal rate. Finally, the median inflation projection is\n1.5 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019. Overall,\nthese economic projections are very sim ilar to those made in September: GDP growth is a touch\nstronger ; the unemployment rate is a shade lower ; and inflation, beyond this year, is unchanged.\nReturning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal\nfunds rate is appropriate in l ight of the solid progress we have seen toward our goals of\nmaximum employment and 2 percent inflation. We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achi eve and\nmaintain our objectives. That ’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate —\nthat is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently quite low by hist orical standards. With the federal funds\nrate only modestly below the neutral rate, we continue to expect that gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.\nThis view is co nsistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate rises to 1.4 percent at the end of next year, 2.1 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.9 percent by the end of 2019. Compared with the projections made in September, the median path for the federal funds rate has been revised up just ¼ percentage point. Only a few participants altered their estimate of the longer -run normal\nfederal funds rate, although the median edged up to 3 percent.\nOf course, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their\nassessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks. As many observers have noted, changes in fiscal policy\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nor other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is far too\nearly to know how these policies will unfold. Moreover, changes in fiscal policy are only one of the many factors that can influence the outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. In making our policy decisions, we will continue —as always —to assess economic conditions\nrelative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. As I have noted on previous occasions, policy is not on a preset course.\nFinally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and\nprincipal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities. As our statement says, we\nanticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well\nunder way. ”\nThank you. I ’d be happy to take your questions.\nHARRIET TORRY. Thank you, Madam Chair. Harriet Torry with the Wall Street\nJournal. Why does the Fed now see three rate increases next year instead of two? Is it because the economy is at risk of overheating , or is the Fed behind the curve , or is this a reaction to\nDonald Trump’ s election?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I would like to emphasize that this is a very modest adjustment\nin the path of the federal funds rate and involves changes by only, you know, some of, you know, some of the participants. So in thinking about the paths and the revisions, there are a number of\nfactors that were taken into account by participants. The unemployment rate is perhaps a touch, as I said, a touch lower than previously ; you’ve seen some modest downward revisions in that —\nin that projection. For this year, there was a slight u pward revision to inflation, and some of the\nparticipants , but not all of the participants , did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal\npolicy into their projections. And that may have been a factor that was one of several that\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\noccasioned these shifts, but I want to emphasize that these —the shifts that you see here are really\nvery tiny.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. In recent testimony, you said your advice\nwas for fiscal authorities to increase the productive capacity of the economy. Do individual and\nbusiness tax cuts increase the productive capacity of the economy? And how would the F ed’s\nreaction be different to fiscal policies that increase the productive capacity of the economy and\nthose that don’ t?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So the statement that I made , that it would be useful to increase the\nproductive capacity of the economy , reflects my concern that productivity growth has been very\nlow. It’s the ultimate determination of the evolution of living standards. Policies that would\nimprove productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development ; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the\nquality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with; and policie s that spur\ninnovation or competition or the formation of new firms. So tax policies can have that e ffect. It\nreally depends on the specifics. I don’ t think there ’s anything that I could say in general about\nwhat tax policy would do , but that —and I really can ’t tell you what the F ed’s response would be\nto any policy changes that are put into effect. I wouldn’ t want to speculate until I were more\ncertain of the details and how they would affect the likely course of the economy.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Okay. A quick follow -up— I’m sorry , but if there was a rush of\nfiscal policy that did not increase the productive capacity of the economy, would that mean the Federal Reserve would have to move more quickly with raising rates?\nCHAIR YELLEN. I—you know, it ’s some thing I really just can ’t generalize about\nbecause, w hile it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nof the economy , an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors that does\naffect the economy ’s neutral rate. A boost to prod uctivity could spur investment . As we have\nbeen saying , we estimate that the value of the neu tral federal funds rate is quite low—has —and\none of the reasons for that is s low productivity growth. And so it ’s very hard to ge neralize about\nit because it could affect that neutral rate.\nJIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi. Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times. For the average\nAmerican, can you explain what the impact of this hike and three additional hikes will be next\nyear? And should they feel more confident in the economy now that you are raising rates at a\nslightly faster pace?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So let me say that our decision to raise rates is —should certainly be\nunderstood as a reflection of the confi dence we have in the pr ogress the economy has made and\nour judgment that that progress will continue . And the economy ha s proven to be remarka bly\nresilient. So it is a vote of confidence in the economy. As you know, this was a decision that\nwas well anticipated in markets , and I think it will have relatively small effect on market rates. It\ncould boost very slightly some short -term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing\ncosts that are linked to them, but , overall, I think that households and firms will see very modest\nchanges from this decision. But , certainly, it’ s important for households and businesses to\nunderstand that my colleagues and I have judged the course of the U .S. economy to be strong ,\nthat we ’re making progress toward our inflation and unemployme nt goals. We have a strong\nlabor market , and we have a resilient economy.\nSAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Clearly, there’ s been a lot of\ndiscussion already about fiscal —fiscal policy. But even if you discount or don’ t know what the\nfiscal outlook is going to be next year, unemployment is already below the longer -run projection\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nunder the policy rule you cited in your August speech. That would suggest that policy ought to\nbe tighter. Is there a risk that the Federal Reserve is alread y behind the curve , even before any\nfiscal impact steps in next year? Thanks.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I would agree that —and as we said in our statement —policy\nremains accommodative. The degree of accommodation I would characterize as moderate. As I’ve emphas ized and said in the statement, we currently judge the neutral level of the federal\nfunds rate to be pretty low. So there is some accommodation. Remember that inflation is still below our objective. The C ommittee projects —at least the median projection shows a very\nmodest undershoot of estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment. The median\nunemployment rate here gets down to 4½ percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate. And we think that that ’s appropriate because\nwe want inflation to rise to our 2 percent objective in a timely fashion.\nSo there is not a substantial undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment. We ’re not\nseeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective. So I do not j udge that we are behind the curve. I’ve—my\njudgment is that we ’re on a good path to reaching our objectives. But , of course , the outlook is\nuncertain. We recognize that there are many sources of uncertainty affecting the outlook. And we will have to ad just our thinking as things evolve, as conditions —conditions evolve, and we\nlearn more about economic policy changes that could affect the outlook.\nJIM TANKERSLEY. Jim Tankersley , Washington Post. I’m curious, you and your\npredecessor had both at times c alled for more fiscal stimulus to help with the outlook, the growth\noutlook. And I ’m wondering , how much do you judge the economy has capacity for fiscal\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nstimulus right now? It’s a version of Steve ’s question, but I think we ’re trying to get at, how\nmuch can happen before we run that risk of overheating?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when\nthe unemployment rate was substantially higher than it is now. So, with a 4.6 percent\nunemployment and a solid labor ma rket, there may be some additional slack in labor markets ,\nbut I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal\npolicy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment. But ,\nnevertheless, let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice t o the new A dministration\nor to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance of policy. There are many considerations th at\nCongress needs to take account of and many bases for justif ying changing fiscal policy. I’ve\ncontinued to highlight the importance of spurring productivity growth, that I think that would be something that ’s beneficial for the economy. Of course , it’s also important for Congress to take\naccount of the fact that , as our population ages , that the debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise ,\nand that needs to continue to be taken into account. And so there are many factors that I think should enter into such decisions.\nCHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Chair\nYellen, you’ve just spoken about some of the risks —the inflationary risks of running in this\nexpansionary fiscal policy. But in October you were wondering whether it might be possible to\nrepair some of the damage done to the labor force during the recession by running what you termed a “ high-pressure economy .” So I ’m wondering, why couldn’ t fiscal policy serve the\nsame end in seeking to run a high- pressure economy , hoping to draw more Americans off the\nsidelines and into the workforce? Is there something necessarily riskier about approaching it\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nfrom the fiscal side , or perhaps have you become less enthusiastic about the idea of running a\nhigh-pressure economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I want to be clear that what I said in that speech in Boston is that\nan important research question is whether or not , in an economy with a very strong labor market ,\nthere might be changes that took place that permanently raised the labor force participation ,\ntraining , and other thing s of the labor —of the labor force that would be positives for the\nproductive potential of our economy on a long -lasting basis. I never said that I favor running a\nhigh-pressure economy. And, you know, as you can see in the SE P projections of the\nparticip ants—and this has long been true not just in this forecast , but in earlier ones as well —you\nsee a modest undershooting. The under —unemployment rate is projected to modestly\nundershoot , for several years, levels that are deemed to be normal in the longer r un. T hat’s an\nappropriate policy purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective. And\nwhile we do n’t want to overshoot our 2 percent objective, we also don’ t want a persistent\nundershoot of our 2 percent objective, and that does invol ve a labor market that may succeed in\nattracting more people off the sidelines into the labor market. I t’s something we will see as we\nexamine experience over the next couple of years. We may adjust our views on this . But I do\nwant to make clear that I have not recommended running a “hot” economy as some sort of\nexperiment.\nLINDSAY DUNSMUIR. Hi, Lindsay Dunsmuir with Reuters. How comfortable are\nyou with possible interference on Fed policy by the incoming P resident? And I ’m talking there\nabout the negative impacts his tweets on aerospace companies in the last week have had on their\nshare prices. And do you feel having a P resident tweeting about individual companies —do you\nfeel that that could begin to distort corporate decisionmaking?\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I ’m not going to offer the incoming P resident advice about how\nto conduct himself in policy. I’m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed. We have\nbeen given the independence by Congress to make decisions about monetary policy in pursuit of\nour dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and inflation , and that is what I intend to\nstay focused on. T hat’s what the C ommittee is focused on.\nBINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum with the New York Times. The\nPresident -elect has said that overhauling financial regulation is a high priority for him. I’m\ncurious whether the Fed has been asked to provide any advice on how that might be done , and\nwhat advice you would provide to the P resident -elect about how our financial regulatory system\nshould be improved?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we have been —our staff have been in touch with the Trump\ntransition team. A nd we , of course , share the objective that the whole government has to work\nconstructively to ensure a smooth transition. I’ve not been in touch beyond that , and it ’s not\nsomething that I would expect. But —I’m sorry , so what would I —\nBINYAMIN APPLEBAUM. I was saying, what advice would you give a bout how the\nsystem should be improved?\nCHAIR YELLEN. About how —\nBINYAMIN APPLEBAUM. —on financial re gulation.\nCHAIR YELLEN. —the f inancial rate. Yes. So, okay, on financial regulation, I feel\nthat we live d through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge toll on our economy. And\nmost members of Congress and the public came away from that exper ience feeling that it was\nimportant to take a set of steps that would result in a safer and stronger financial system. And I\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nfeel that we have done that. That has been our mission since the financial crisis for the last six or\nseven years. That ’s what Dodd- Frank was designed to do.\nI think it ’s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important\nfirm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity , by performing stress tests that\nprovide us another way of e nsuring that th e firms we count on to supply credit to households and\nbusinesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock. The firms —the largest firms have a great deal more capital than they did before the crisis. Those are\nimport ant changes. We have placed the toughest regulations on those firms that are systemically\nimportant. I would advise that —and we have been trying to do this —that it’ s important to look\nfor ways to relieve regulatory burden on community banks and smaller i nstitutions , to tailor\nregulation so that it’ s appropriate for the systemic risk profile of the particular institutions.\nI think there was broad agreement also that we s hould end “ too bi g to fail,” and that\nmeans not only reducing the odds of the failure of a systemically important institution , but also\nmaking sure that , should such a firm fail , that it could be resolved in an orderly way. And the\nliving wills process has been about that , and I think we ’ve made considerable progress in making\nsure that the largest and most systemic firms conduct their businesses in a day -to-day way with\nsome thought about —with important thinking in place about whether or not the way they are\nconducting their business would aid resolution in the event that they encountered a severe\nnegative shock. So this is progress , I would say , it’s very important not to roll back. There may\nbe some changes that could be made, and we ’ve suggested a few , like eliminating the burden of\ncompliance with the Volcker rule, or incentive compensation, regulations for smaller banks , or\nmodestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhance d prudential supervision. But\nI would urge that it ’s important to keep this in place.\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associa ted Press. The election of\nDonald Trump seem ed to have sparked a major reaction in financial markets : stock prices at\nrecord highs, the dollar has strengthened, long -term interest rates are higher. The —did any of\nthat get discussed in the meeting and di d it—do you feel that it will have any effect, either\nnegative or positive , on things? And also, did you have any broader discussion about Trump’ s\neconomic plan and what it might do and how the Fed might have to react?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we did discuss the se topics in our meeting today. I would simply\nsummarize by saying that all the FOMC participants recognize that there is considerable\nuncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the\neconomy. And in so far as that will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor\nthose policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters. We will have to factor that into our outlook and figure out what is an appropria te\nresponse. But we ’re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment , and we have time to\nwait to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decisionmaking as we gain greater clarity.\nYou mentioned the market moves. So I see the market mo ves as implicit forecast s about\nwhat impact these policies are likely to have on the economy. The changes —the financial\nmarket changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer -term rates , and the strengthening of the dollar , suggest that many market participants\nanticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rate s somewhat in the United\nStates relative to abroad and would cause a strengthening in the dollar. But market participants\nwere uncertain too, and I would expect changes in our understanding of what is going to happen to also affect market prices in financial markets as we move forward.\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Hi, Nanc y Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.\nWondering about slack, when do you think the slack in the labor market will have work ed its\nway through so we ’re no longer talking about it at press conferences and it ’s not such a big\nissue?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So this is not something that it ’s possible to judge preci sely. My\ncolleagues write down their best estimates of a normal longer -run unemployment rate. The\nmedian stands at 4.8 percent, so we ’re close, possibly —the unemployment rate right now is ever\nso slightly below , but in the nei ghborhood. If we look at la rger, broader mea sures of slack , like\nthe U -6 measure that includes involuntary part -time employment and those who are marginally\nattached to the labor force, t hey’re slightly higher than pre -recession levels, but they ’ve come\ndown considerably. We look a t a broad array of i ndicators of the labor market, a nd if you look at\njob openings or the hires rate or the quits rate or difficulty of hiring workers as reported in\nbusiness surveys, you know, I would say the labor market looks a lot like the way it did before\nthe recession , that it’ s—we’re roughly comparable to 2007 levels when we thought the, you\nknow, there was a normal amount of slack in the labor market. The labor market was in the vicinity of maximum employment.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Given\nPresident -elect Trump ’s criticism of your low -rate policy during the campaign, like it or not,\nmarket participants are going to focus a lot in 2017 on you. You ’ve suggested you will serve out\nyour term, but I ’m curious if that statement still holds , if you would like another term as Fed\nChair, if you would accept another term as Fed C hair, and would you stay on the C ommittee if\nyou were not Fed C hair?\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. So I guess the way I think about it is that I was confirmed by the\nSenate to a four -year term. The term of the Fed Chair was not meant to coincide with that of the\nPresident , and there were good reasons for that , too. It’s part of ensuring the independe nce of the\nFed. And so I do intend to serve out my four -year term. I haven ’t made any decision about the\nfuture . I, you know, I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It’s a decision that I don’ t\nhave to make and don’ t, you know, don ’t have thoughts on at this time. And , as you said, I\nrecognize too that I could stay on as a Board member, and that ’s a decision for another day.\nPETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business. Just to follow up on Marty ’s question\nabout the financial markets , the Dow is about to hit 20,000. It’s up substantially since the\nelection on, apparently, investor optimism about potential —the impact of President -elect\nTrump ’s policies on the economy and an improving economy. I wonder if you share that\noptimism, number one, and, if not, are we seeing a bout of, perhaps, irrational exuberance right\nnow? Or are you concerned at all about a bubble in equity prices that could create some\nfinancial instability in the economy?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, I really don ’t want to comment on the level of stock\nprices . They may have been boosted by expectations about tax policy ; possible cuts in corporate\ntax rates that have been much discussed ; or by expectations about growth, possible reductions ,\nand downside risk to the economy. But, you know, these are things tha t market participants are\ntrying to view , along with the likely path of —paths of interest rates, and I think all of that factors\ninto movements and stock valuations. But I don’t—I don ’t want to offer a view as to whether\nthey’re appropriate .\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nPETER BARNES. You have said—mentioned— can I just follow up? On equity prices,\nyou have talked about whether or not the valuations are still —are within historical ranges and\nnorms. Did —is Dow 20,000 kind of within historical norms? Are you comfortable w ith that?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think rates of return in the stock market relative to —\nremember that the level of interest rates is low , and , taking that into account, I believe it’ s fair to\nsay that they remain within normal ranges.\nJOHN HELTMAN. John He ltman of American Banker. You said that much progress\nhas been made since the crisis in making the banks more secure, more safe, higher liquidity,\ncapital levels, et cetera. Does that feeling extend to the culture of the banks, the way that they\nrun, the way that they operate in their approach towards —towards business? Do you think that\nmore needs to be done there? Do you expect that if there has been improvement, that it will continue to be —that culture will continue to improve in the next A dministration and the next\nCongress?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, there have been many ways in which there have been\ncompliance failures at large organizations , and you’ ve seen a series of enforcement actions by\nthe banking regulators over a range of practices that suggest s some breakdown of compliance or\nculture, whether it involves violations of sanctions or foreign exchange or LIBOR or other matters. So this is something that we ’ve discussed and emphasized, the importance of a culture\nof compliance. And the B oard will b e undertaking review. We ’ve already beg un this year ,\nbroadly , of compliance and management of compliance risk in the largest corporations . So I\nthink this is something that’ s important. And the failings that we have seen in a number of\ninstitutions sugg est there is certainly room for improvement.\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nGREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I’d like to —two questions , if I might—\nfollow up on the question about running the economy hot that you mentioned in your speech up\nin Boston a couple months ago. You brought it up . Are you now sort of distancing yourself\nfrom the idea?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I want to make clear what I said and what I didn ’t say. One of\nthe things we ’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history\nand around the globe is that , very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a\nrecession, that productivity doesn’ t pick up to pre -recession levels and that there looks like there\nis a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy , which is called “ hysteresis. ”\nAnd I raise d the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.\nWe have seen quite a few people who lost their jobs duri ng the G reat R ecession drop out of the\nlabor force and, you know, lose their ties and become discouraged and not reenter. And I raised\nthe question a s to whether or not hysteresis could operate in the opposite direction. And that was\na research question for economist s to see if there is any evidence, because it could be important\nin determining policy. But I didn’t —I didn’ t draw any policy conclusions from that. And , as I\nindicated, I think the path that you see —that the Committee has laid out in a tentative way that\ninvolves a modest degree of undershooting of normal longer -run levels of unemployment going\ndown to around 4½ percent would remain for a couple of years —might provide some insight. So\nI was not recommending a substantially easier policy in order to test that hypothesis.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess my question to—that I had before that\nfollow -up was, both times you’ ve raised rates in this cycle, t he market expectations o f a rate hike\nhave been over 50 percent. The market has, you know, kind of priced it in. Is that a prerequ isite\ngoing forward? Will that have to happen as you go forward?\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nCHAIR YELLEN. It’s not a prerequisite , but we do try to explain our evolving views as\nclearly as we can. It’s important for market participants to have a sense of how we think about\nthe economy and the appropriate path of policy , to look at incoming data , and to form their own\njudgments as to whether or not changes in policy would be appropriate. And while it’s not a\nprerequisite , if we ’re in good sync in terms of explaining what goes into our policy judgments ,\nit’s not surprising that it would often be true that moves are well anticipated by the market. As I\nsaid, in thinking about today ’s move, we ’ve indicated that we thought we were making progress\non our objectives. We wanted to see some more. I think anyone looking at incoming data can\nclearly see that we have enjoyed further progress both in the labor market and on inflation. And ,\ntherefore, there are good reasons why the market should have antic ipated a moved today.\nPATRICK GILL ESPIE. Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN. There ’s been a lot of\ndiscussion about manufacturing jobs and trade. I’m wondering, what do you think are two or\nthree concrete steps that could be taken to increase manufacturing employment in the United\nStates? And , separately, I ’ve asked you about the importance of job training program s,\nsomething that you’ ve emphasized. Specifically, what do you think about the worker assistance\nprovided to workers who lose their jobs to trade, both the financial ass istance and the worker\nretraining programs? Are they sufficient?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So , I don’ t want to weigh in. I don’ t intend to weigh in. I haven ’t\nweighed in on either fiscal policy , specifics of evaluating policies. I’m not going to weigh in\neither on the details of particular trade policies. But, more generally, I ’d say , you asked me\nabout manufacturing. There were a lot of manufacturing jobs lost over a long period of time and\nparticularly after —during the G reat R ecession. We’ve had some recovery in manufacturing\nemployment as the econom y’s recovered. So, to some extent, manufacturing employment\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\ndepends on the progress of the economy, and we have seen some recovery. Over a long period\nof time, technological change is something that has been important in reducing manufacturing\nemployment absolutely and as a share of jobs in the economy. For decades, the pace of\ntechnological change in manufacturing has outstripped that in the economy as a whole. And , so,\nfirms —man ufacturing firms have found it easier to continue producing by —with reducing their\nworkforces. And that ’s a change that I would expect to continue.\nYou mentioned worker assistance. So some of the forces that are acting on\nmanufacturing and other sectors , including technological change and globalization—e ven though\nmost economists would judge the overall consequences of these developments for the economy\nto be positive, certainly there are groups of workers who were harmed by developments pertaining to glo balization and technology. And I think most economists and policymakers\nrecognize that it ’s important to provide ways for workers who were harmed by these kinds of\ndevelopments to be retrained for jobs so that they can succeed in the economy. And so, I m ean, I\nwould agree —without getting into any particular program and whether it’ s sufficient , I do think\nthat it’ s important to recognize there are those who were harmed by these developments , and\ntheir concerns, I think, need to be addressed by policymaker s, certainly.\nJUSTINE UNDERHILL. Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance. So the F ed’s balance sheet\nhas grown to over $4 trillion. And as the Fed begins removing policy accommodation, under what circumstances would you see the Fed removing or possibly winding down its balance sheet\nin either letting mature —securities mature or possibly outright selling bonds from the SOMA\nportfolio?\nCHAIR YELLEN. So we ’ve indicated in our normalization principles that we expect to\ndiminish the size of our portfolio over time l argely by ceasing reinvestments of principal rather\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nthan by selling securities. We ’ve indicated that once the process of normalization of the federal\nfunds rate is well under way, we would probably begin to allow our portfolio to run off. We ’ve\nnot yet m ade any precise decisions about when that will occur. We want to feel that if the\neconomy w ere to suffer an adverse shock, that we have some scope through traditional means of\ninterest rate cuts to be able to respond to that. Now, there’ s no mechanical r ule about what level\nof the federal funds rate we might deem appropriate to begin that process. It’s not something\nthat only depends on the le vel of the federal funds rate . It also depends on our judgment of the\namount of momentum in the economy and poss ible concerns about downside risks to the\neconomy. So we ’ve not yet made this decision, but it is something that we have long planned, to\nbegin to allow our balance sheet to run off. And then it would take several years. And we would\nend up, if all goes well, with a substantially smalle r balance sheet than we have at present.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires. I wonder ed if the\nunexpected outcome of the election and the sense that a lot of people are really upset with how the economy is performing despite having, you know, aggregate economic statistics that look\npretty good—i s that causing you in any way to think differently about how you evaluate the\neconomy, like what sort of things you look for to get a sense of what ’s going on in the economy ?\nIs—you know, basically, did how things turned out in the election —is it making you think\ndifferently about how you evaluate the economy ’s performance and how it ’s doing?\nCHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mean, we ’ve long been aware, a nd I’ve spoken about\npreviously disturbing trends in the economy, particularly rising wage inequality, income inequality, and the fact that a significant share of our population hasn’ t been enjoying significant\nreal wage gains , if any. And so these are long -standi ng concerns. These are not new\nphenomenon, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated developments that had\n\nDecember 14, 2016 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference \n\nlong been affecting many American workers and households. And I think they are quite\ndisturbing.\nNow, the y’re ones that the Fed is not well positioned— I think our policies can affect the\ngeneral level of economic activity and slack in the labor market, the level —the rate of inflation ,\nwhich we focus on. But I think it ’s important for policymakers more broadly to be attentive to\nthese trends and to think about policies that could address them. We ’ve been quite attentive with\nrespect to particular demographic groups in the labor market . Particularly , minorities tend to be\nvery badly affected by downturns. We ’ve discussed that . We’ve been focused on it —it’s not\njust since the election —and are pleased to see that they are enjoying gains. For example, the\nAfrican American unemployment rate at this point is no w rough— about back to 2007 levels as\nwell. But these are important trends, and I think it ’s important for policy to address them."
