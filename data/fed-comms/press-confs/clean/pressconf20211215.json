  "text": "CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates\nnear zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the\ncriteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates. In addition, in light of\nthe strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pres sures, we decided to speed up the\nreductions in our asset purchases. As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy , which will continue to provide appropriate\nsupport for the econom y.\nEconomic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year , reflecting progress on\nvaccinations and the reopening of the economy. A ggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed\nby fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron\nvariant, pose [s] risks to the outlook. Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply\nconstraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapi d growth. A s shown in our Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP) , the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent\nthis year and 4 percent next year.\nAmid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the\neconomy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment . Job gains have been\nsolid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate has declined substantially —falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last\n\nmeeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November. The recent improvements in labor market\nconditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at\nthe lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans a nd Hispanics. Labor\nforce participation showed a welcome rise in November —but remains subdued, in part reflecting\nthe aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking\nwork report that they are out of the labor for ce because of factors related to the pandemic,\nincluding caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus . At the same time, employers\nare having difficulties filling job openings , and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many\nyears. How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve,\nwith the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their\nunemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next .\nSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the\neconomy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the\nnear term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated , exacerbated by\nwaves of the virus. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer -run\ngoal and will likely continue to do so well int o next year . While the drivers of higher inflation\nhave been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic , price increases\nhave now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, but ,\nthus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation. We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put\n\nupward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to e xpect inflation to decline to\nlevels closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal by the end of next year . The median inflation\nprojection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year ; this\ntrajectory is notably higher than pr ojected in September .\nWe understand that high inflation im poses significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food , housing, and transportation. We are\ncommitted to our price -stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a\nstrong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. W e will be\nwatching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions hav e been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the\nCommittee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate. We also updated\nour assessment of the pr ogress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our\nforward guidance for the federal funds rate. With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some\ntime, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor ma rket\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment .\nAll FOMC participants forecast that th is remaining test will be met next year. T he\nmedian projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds ra te is 0.9 percent at the end of\n2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September . Participants expect a\ngradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of\nits longer -run level by the end of 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a\n\nCommittee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a\nyear or more from now.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its\nasset purchases. Beginning in mid -January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset\npurchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage -backed\nsecurities. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in ou r securities\nholdings would cease by mid- March —a few months sooner than we anticipated in early\nNovember . We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation\npressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing\namounts of policy support. In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset pur chases will better\nposition policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. We remain prepared to\nadjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And, e ven after\nour balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions.\nTo conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -\nstability goal.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mr. Chair, we ’ll go to Rachel from the Washington Post .\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you ver y much, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for\ntaking our questions. The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate\n\nto keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum\nemployment. And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year. In\norder to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like? When will you\nknow that that threshold has been met? And how will that be communicated? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So maximum employment, if you look at our S tatement on L onger -\nRun G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a\nbroad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force. We ’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different\ndemographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers. So that ’s a—that’s a\njudgment for the Committee to make. The Committee will make a judgmen t that we ’ve achieved\nlabor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that —it is ,\nadmittedly , a judgment call because it ’s a range of factors. U nlike inflation, where we have one\nnumber that sort of dominates , it’s a broad range o f things. So, as I mentioned in my opening\nremarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see\nthat, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Steve at CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN . All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is : If—It’s often\nsaid that monetary policy has long and variable lags . How does continuing to buy assets now,\neven though it ’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem? Won’ t the impac t of\ntoday’ s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current\ninflation problem? And a ren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets\n\nsuch that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in\nMarch that you ’ll start to have any impact on the inflation problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop\npurchasing now ?,” I would just say this : We’ve learned tha t, in dealing with balance sheet\nissues, we’ ve learned that it ’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make\nadjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it. And we thought that this was —this was a doubling\nof the speed. We’ re basically two m eetings away now from finishing the taper. And we thought\nthat was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it , and that ’s what will happen.\nYou know, the question of long and variable lags is , is an interesting one. That ’s, that’s\nMilton Friedman ’s famous statement. And I do think that in this world, where everything is —\nwhere the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very\nquickly. And my own sense is that they get into —financial conditions affect the econ omy fairly\nrapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months. Shorter than that,\nrather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we ’re going to do, the markets move\nimmediately [in response] to that. So financial con ditions are changing to reflect, you know, the\nforecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were\nexpecting. But financial conditions don’ t wait to change until , until things actually happen.\nThey , they change on the expectation of things happening. So I don’ t think it’ s a question of\nhaving to wait.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can I just follow up ? Thinking about having to wait, is it still the\npolicy, or the position , of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete?\nThank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding\naccommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation. Since we’ re two meeti ngs away\nfrom completing the taper, assuming things go as , as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off\nbefore then, then, then what we —you would stop the taper potentially sooner . But it’s not\nsomething I expect to happen. But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate , and we —and we\ndon’t find ourselves in a situation where we —where we might have to raise rates while we ’re\nstill purchasing assets.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let ’s go to Colby at the FT.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I’ m curious exactly how much\ndistance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase.\nBack in 2014, the guidance was —that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target\nlevel for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program. Is that an approach you\nsupport now ? O r does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we , we haven’ t made any decision of that nature. And so, no, I\nwouldn’ t say that ’s our position at all . We really haven ’t taken a position on that. I will say that\nwe did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example. And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet , last time. And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They\nthought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we ha ve at the current time, and that those —the differences that we see\nnow would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet . And the same thing would\nbe true about raising rates. I don’ t—I don’ t foresee that there would be that kind of very\n\nexten ded wait at this time. The economy is so much stronger. I was here at the Fed when we\nlifted off the last time . And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full\nemployment. Inflation is running well above target , and growth is well above potential. There\nwouldn’ t be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I —you know, we ’ll make this\ndecision in coming meetings , and it ’s not —it’s not a decision that the Committee has really\nfocused on yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Nic k at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal . Chair Powell,\nin March you answered a question about maximum employment like this : You said 4 percent\nwould be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it ’ll take more than that to get to maximum\nemployment. More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of\nmaximum employment that ’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run. Has your view\nof the level of maximum employment changed this year? And if so, how? And how close is the\neconomy right now to your judgment of the short -run level of maximum employment?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So the —you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the\nsame economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on, that was —the sense was that\nthat’s where we were headed. The post -pandemic labor market , and the economy in general , will\nbe different. And the maximum level of e mployment that ’s consistent with price stability\nevolves over time within a —within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting\n[the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic. So\nI would s ay: Look, we ’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it ’s been —the unemployment rate has\nbeen dropping very quickly. So we ’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.\n\nThe way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been\nlabor force p articipation, of course, where we had widely thought —I had certainly thought —\nthat, last fall , as unemployment insurance ran off , as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools\nreopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge , in labor force\nparticipation. So we ’ve begun to see some improvement. We certainly welcome the 2/10\nimprovement that we got in the November report. But I do think that it ’s—it feels likely now\nthat the return to higher participation is going to take longer. And, in fact, that ’s, that’s been the\npattern in past cycles —that labor force participation has tend ed to recover in the wake of a strong\nrecovery in unemployment, which is what we ’re getting right now. So you—i t could well have\nbeen that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong— the\nnumber of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled\npeople back in. But, really, it ’s the pandemic, it ’s a range of factors. But the reality is, we don’ t\nhave a strong labor force participation recovery yet , and we may not have it for some time. At\nthe same time, we have to make policy now. And inflation is well above target. So this is\nsomething we need to take into— take into account.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could —if I could follow up, you’ ve talked recently about risk\nmanagement. And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates bef ore you’ re convinced that you’ ve achieved the employment test in your forward\nguidance?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is —this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made .\nBut you’ re really asking a question about how our framework works. And, yes, ther e is a—\nthere ’s a provision, it used to be called the “ balanced approach” provision , that says, in effect,\nthat in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum -employment goal and [the pursuit of] the\n\nprice -stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal\nand the —and the speed at which we ’re approaching it. And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp ”\nwhich could , in concept , be taken and it ’s in our framework, it ’s been in our framework a long\ntime. I ’ve talked about it on a number of occasions. It, it is a provision that would enable us to,\nin this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment. Now,\nwe’re—as I said, we’ re making rapid progress toward maxim um employment in my —in my\nthinking, in my opinion. A nd I don’ t at all know that we will —that we ’ll have to invoke that ,\nthat paragraph. But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework —and has been , really ,\nfor a very long time.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ ll go to Howard at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks , as usual. So I guess I got ta ask about the elephant in\nthe room, which is the Omicron variant. You know, this seems to already be pushing one of\nyour colleag ues, the Bank of England, off its course. Things have evolved very fast there.\nHasn ’t quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet . But people seem to expect it to. So I ’m\nwondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more\ninfectious , but less serious, variant of the virus? Or are you simply confident that the U.S.\neconomy can continue its divorce from the pandemic?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think there ’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we —why we\ncalled it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk. It’s—we, we follow the same\nexperts and I —we , we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the\nsame articles in the paper and the same research and , you know, so the —you mentioned the early\nassessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from , from\n\nexisting vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease. That ’s a first draft.\nWe’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be. It may well come to the United\nStates and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly . That could easily happen.\nI think there ’s another step there, though—which is what ’s going to be the effect on the\neconomy. A nd that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to\nsuppressing supply. It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or\nhiring on top of what ’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’ s\nhitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern\nseaboard and now coming down. W e’re having quite a wave of Delta. So coming in on top of\nthat, again, it ’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be. I do think, wave upon\nwave, people are learning to live with this. More and more people are getting vaccinated. So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect , in\nthe aggregate , people who are not vaccinated. So the more people get vaccinated, the less the\neconomic effect. It doesn ’t mean it won ’t have an economic effect . Delta had an effect of\nslowing down hiring. And it actually —it had an effect on global supply chains. And that sort\nof—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out. So it can have an\neconomic effect. I just think , at this point, we don’ t know much. We’ ll know a whole lot more\nin three weeks , and we ’ll know more than that in six weeks.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But if I can follow up : You’re clearly , sort of from a risk\nstandpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon. W hich sort of implies that\nwhatever Omicron brings, you’ re comfortable the economy ca n handle it without quantitative\neasing.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes . Yes, look, I think— if you look at the state of the economy and\nthe amount —the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of\ndemand for labor, look at inflation, lo ok at wages . I think moving, you know, moving forward\nthe end of our taper by a few months is really —is really an appropriate thing to do. And I think,\nreally, Omicron doesn’ t really have much to do with that.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH . Let ’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chairman Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I\nwonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater\nwariness around inflation .\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I guess I would go back and— you know, it ’s been a\ncontinual process, really. Inflation really popped up, right ? In the late spring last year. And we\nhad a view —it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be\ntemporary . It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it. And\nthere was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said. Certainly, we had five months of decl ining month on month— monthly\nreadings of inflation, but we didn’ t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other\nsupply- side issues. Then in September, I ’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to\nbecome clear that this was both l arger in its effect on inflation and more persistent. And , of\ncourse, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward. We move d the taper forward and we —and it ’s a much faster taper than had been\nplanned. So we ’ve been adapting— I’ve been saying we ’re adapting our policy.\n\nSo com ing to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November\nmeeting —it was the Friday before the November meeting —and it was very high, 5.7 percent\nreading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annual ized, for the\nthird quarter, just before the meeting. And I thought for a second there whether we —whether we\nshould increase our taper , [We] decided to go ahead with what we had— what we had\n“socialized. ” Then , right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the\nmeeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and,\nand no increase in labor supply. And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot ,\nhigh reading. And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to— we\nneeded to look at , at speeding up the taper. And we went to work on that . So that ’s, that’s really\nwhat happened. It was essentially higher inflation and faster —turns out much faster progress in\nthe labor market. Really, what ’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up— seems to\nbe catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [declin e] over one\ncycle. So that ’s really what happened a nd, you know, widely supported in the Committee today,\nas you can see—unanimous vote —but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know,\nthis, this move.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. If I could just follow up quickly, you noted that the ECI was one\nof the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don ’t see signs that wages\nare actually factoring into inflation yet. And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as, as you’ re making these assessments.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So —but I said —you, you quoted me correctly . It’s, it’s—so\nfar, we don’ t see—wages are not a big part of the high- inflation story that we ’re seeing. As you\nlook forward, let ’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out , and supply chains get\n\nworking again, and maybe there ’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing. But\nwhat , what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation. In\nparticul ar—we don’ t see this yet , but if you had something where wages were persistently—\n[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure\non, on firms , and they raise prices. I t would take something that was persistent and material for\nthat to happen. And we don’ t see that yet. But with the kind of hot labor market readings —\nwages we’ re seeing, it ’s something that we ’re—that we’re watching. And the other thing, of\ncourse, is , is rents, which are very important. Yo u know, owners ’ equivalent rent. That’s\nanother thing which is very economically sensitive . Unlike the things that are causing the\ninflation now , this is economically sensitive —and so would be expected to move up. And so as\nthe—as some things go down, the question is : Where will we be when we come out the other\nside of this ? And we need to keep our eyes on those things.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ ll go to Chris at the AP.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Well, next year, you could see growth\nslowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely. Would you delay rate hikes in that situation? And how would you think about\nthat? And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of\nsituation, with inflation fading and growth slowing? How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan. It’s not\nsomething we debate, negotiate over , or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should\nbe. People write down their , their assumptions —their assessment of appropriate policy based on\n\ntheir economic forecast. And so the m edian —what you’ re talking about, the three rate increases,\nthat’s the median of the Committee —the median of the Committee is also that growth will be\n4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year. So that ’s a really\nstrong econ omy. And, of course, if the —if the economy turns out to be quite different from that,\nthen so will the rate. You know, we —no one will say, “Oh, we can ’t change our policy because\nwe wrote something down in December .” No one ’s ever said that or will. It will— the actual\nrate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast. So, for example,\nif, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have\nan effect of slowing down rate increases. B ut we ’d have to—you know, we look at our two\ngoals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Victoria Guida at Politi co.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on maximum\nemployment. So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a de- emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment.\nAnd, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation. And that’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment. So, I ’m\nwondering, you know, you’ ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure\nmaximum employment . But from what I understand, that ’s still basically : The way that you\nknow that you’ re there is inflation. So is that understanding correct? And how is —are those\nsignals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that ’s caused by, you know,\nthese supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things? So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay . So let me st art by saying that the inflation that we got was not\nat all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework. This was—i t really\nwas a completely different thing . It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal\nstimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply- side\nbarriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call\na vertical supply curve. So, you know, automobile purchases are very i nterest rate-sensitive , and\nyou would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars , But it can ’t, because they don’ t\nhave semiconductors. So , so that —it was a very different kind of inflation. This is not the\ninflation we were looking for under our framework at all. It’s nothing to do with our framework.\nAnd our —the way we ’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework.\nBut com ing to maximum employment, which is really your question. H ow do you know ?\nSo I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities. When you—i f you want to look at\nmaximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is\nwages. It’ s one of the things you look at. And, you know, it ’s—So I mentioned a number of\nother things . You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the\nunemployment rate, different age groups of —you know, prime -age labor force participation, in\nparticular, gets a lot of focu s, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus. And wages, that ’s, that’s really\none of the great signal s. The quits rate is another one. The quits rate is really one of the very\nbest indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like\nthey can get a better job. And there ’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that\ngoing on—suggesting, again, that you’ ve got a very tight labor market.\nSo on wages, that ’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data,\nwhether we ’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum\n\nemployment. And so that ’s, that’s how we think about it. But the —one of the complications is\nthat, again, we ’ve got to make policy in real time. So how do we think about that? Do we —if\nwe think we can make labor , you know, participation might move up—i f we, let’s say we knew\nthat it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running\nway above target? Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what ’s\nmax—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real\ntime is , is one way to think about it.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Just to kin d of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise\ninterest rates next year and, you know, it ’s—you ’re not certain whether you’ re at maximum\nemployment, are you all going to point —when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to\nways in which the labor market could still improve?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes . I mean, I —absolutely. I , I think —well, whether or not we —\nwhether or not we say “ we’re at conditions —labor market conditions consistent with , with\nmaximum employment ” next year, we would all be open a nd I think expect, over time, that the\nlevel of maximum employment that ’s consistent with price stability would increase further over\ntime—for example, through increasing participation. So I —we would certainly —we would not,\nin any way, want to foreclose t he idea that the labor market can get even better. But, again, with\ninflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We’ ve got to make that assessment\nin real time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Olivia from Bloomberg.\nOLIVIA ROCKEMAN. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for\ntaking our questions. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force\nparticipation. And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy t o kind of get\n\na meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot,\nlike in the last expansion, is one way of doing that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever\nran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it. You know, the ratio of job openings,\nfor example, to , to vacancies is at all -time highs . Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even\nhotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know,\nthat’s—really , “Why is it low ?” is the question. So there , there are a bunch of answers , and all\nof them probably have some , you know, some validity. Part of it will be that people —for certain\npeople, they don’ t want to go back in the labor force because either they ’re medically vulnerable\nor they’ re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That ’s one thing. The\nlack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it— not just for children,\nbut for older people. It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people ’s\nportfolios are stronger— they may go back to being a one -income rather than a two -income\nfamily. The same thing with people ’s houses . People buy—they have a mortgage , you know,\nwith leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled. And they might make —reach the same conclusion. So they’ re—and people have\nsavings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’ t spend on travel\nand things like that and also because of , you know, because of government transfers.\nSo, for all of those reasons —and it ’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays —\nwe, we have a situation where we’ ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not\nunwinding as quickly as , as many, as expected. And people —in effect, a good pa rt of it is\nvoluntary. You know, people —and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that ’s,\nthat’s their, certainly their choice. In other cases, it ’s something that will abate very quickly if\n\nand when the pandemic gets under control. And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know,\nmaybe the less likely that people will come back because they ’re—you know, they get used to\ntheir new life and they lose contact with their old jobs. That ’s, that’s what the evidence would\nsay.\nSo it’s a range of things. It isn ’t that the economy lacks stimulus. You know, usually, in\nevery other expansion, it ’s that there aren ’t enough jobs and people can ’t find jobs and, you\nknow, we ’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That ’s not the problem\nhere. The problem is a supply- side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think\nit’s going to be time . And the number -one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic\nget under control. That ’s what everyone would really like to see : What does the labor force—\nwhat does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that\nwe’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn ’t look like that ’s coming anytime soon.\nOLIVIA ROCKEMAN. And just to quickly follow up on that : If some of the reason that\nlabor force participation isn ’t back to, you know, February 2020 levels is because people are\nvoluntarily making life decisions that are d ifferent, does that make you think we ’re going to end\nup at a lower rate overall?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, there ’s a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we\nactually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But—so one would\nexpect over time that labor force participation would , would move down because an aging\npopulation, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that ,\nthat the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down.\nThe question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of\n2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that —is a good one. And , I mean, I —What we can\n\ndo is try to create the conditions . There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but\nstable labor market, where people are coming in, they’ re getting into the labor force, they’ re\ngetting paid well. In the labor market we had before, we had, you know —the biggest wage\nincreases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of\nyears. There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. H igher\nparticipation is one of them. And we ’d love to get back there. But, again, ultimately, we have\nthe tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation. I\nmean, really, it might be —one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is\nactually high inflation, because , to get back to where we were, the evi dence grows that it ’s going\nto take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we ’ve been\nhaving. O ver the last 40 years, w e’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded\nhistory, including the last one, which was t he longest in our recorded history. That ’s what it\nwould really take to get back to the kind of labor market we ’d like to see. And to have that\nhappen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Ok ay, let’s go to Edward Lawre nce at Fox.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks. Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question,\nChair Powell. So I was looking at the cons ensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales.\nAnd what you’ re seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and d rinking places, more people\nspending at grocery stores. You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also\ndepartment store sales down 5.4 percent month over month. How concerned or what is your\nlevel of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus , or something else? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter. I don’ t\nknow, Edward, whether you’ re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store,\nbut consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are\ngoing back to work and they’ re getting wage increases. Admittedly, some of the wage increases\nis being eaten away by inflation. But, n onetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really\nsignificantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong. There may be\nsomething in the seasonality that this year ’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.\nAnd, of course, the re may be effects from , from Delta and there might be going forward from\nOmicron. But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Ok ay, let’s go to Mike at Bloomberg.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month ’s or\nthis meeting ’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely move d\nfor 2022 and 2023. You ’ve said you expect inf lation to fall significantly. Is that because you ’re\ngoing to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade? In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates? And does it suggest t hat\nmaybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you ’re “behind the curve ”?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, actually, I ’m looking at the SEP here , and the median forecasts\nfor core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each. So that ’s a significant —you know, in\nan SEP, that ’s a pretty significant move up. You know, it ’s, it’s based on both of those things, I\nsuppose. I do think there ’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the\nbottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the cours e of this year. If you look at where B lue C hip\nforecasts are —which is, you know, a group of well -resourced, large forecasting operations with a\n\nlong track record—they ’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back -end\nof next year.\nI would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect. There will be\na lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well. And, you know, t hat’s the most likely\ncase.\nI guess what —the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that ’s a\ncertainty , and we ’re not going to act as though that ’s a certainty. There ’s a real risk now, we\nbelieve, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation\nexpectations under pressure , and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has\nincreased . It’s certainly increased. I don’ t think it’ s high at this moment, but I think it ’s\nincreased. And I t hink that ’s part of the reason behind our move today. [It] is to put ourselves in\na position to be able to deal with that risk. And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.\nWe need to see more data. We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in\ncoming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher\ninflation doesn’ t get entrenched. For one reason, as I —as I just mentioned, it’ s one of the two\nbig threats, the other being the pandemi c itself, to getting back to maximum employment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal .\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So as the Fed shifts\ntowards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial -stability risks right now. I\nmean, these periods can be—you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far. But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks? Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now? And are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we have —we have had now for a decade and more a\nfour-part financial stability framework that we use so we can —we can hold ourselves to the\nsame kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually. And there are\nfour key areas : asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and\nleverage among financial institutions. So I would say asset valuations —I’m going to go really\nsuperficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say. Debt owed by\nbusinesses, you know, and households —households are in very strong financial shape.\nBusinesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low. But ,\nnonetheless, it ’s something we ’re watching. Funding risk is, by and lar ge, low among , among\nfinancial institutions . But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know,\nwould applaud the SEC ’s action this week. Leverage among financial institutions is low , in the\nsense that [their] capital is high. So, overall, you know, financial stability , that ’s how —I\nwouldn’t make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces.\nIn terms of the things, you know, that we ’re—that we’re looking for , looking at, you\nknow, it ’s the—it’s the things we ’ve already talked about, to some extent . It’s, it’s the\nemergence of a new variant that could , you know, that could lead to significant economic —if\nthere were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy. We don’ t see that. We don ’t have any basis for\nthinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it ’s certainly one we’ re looking at. I\nwould say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most —you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with. I think we know how\nto deal with bad loans and things like that. I think more —a cyberattack that were to take down a\nmajor financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial\n\nstability risk that we haven ’t actually faced yet. So I could go on with a list of “horribles,” but I\nthink that ’s a decent picture of where I would start.\nMICHAEL DERBY. How about the cryptocurrenc y issues? Anything that worries you\nthere that ’s going on in there in terms of —you know, obviously a lot ’s happening in that sector .\nDoes that concern you at all?\nCHAIR POWELL . You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current\nfinancial -stability concerns. I, of course, would support the , the views expressed in the\nPresident ’s Working G roup report on stablecoins. Stablecoins can certainly be a useful,\nefficient , cons umer -serving , part of the financial system , if they ’re properly regulated. And ,\nright now, they aren ’t. And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to\nbe, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have\na payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately\nsystemically important that didn ’t have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies\non the government —and [on] the Fed, in particular —to make sure that the payment system is\nsafe and reliable, as well as the dollar and —you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted\ncurrency. So —but I do think those are longer term.\nIn terms of, you know, the more —the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really\nspeculative assets, I don ’t see them as a financial -stability concern at the moment. I do think\nthey are risky, they’ re not backed by anything, and I think there ’s big consumer —issues for\nconsumers who may or may not understand what they’ re getting. And there ’s certainly\ndevelopments in the —in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our\njurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that ’s built into and those sorts of\nthings is certainly worth, worth watching.\n\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER. Chair Powell . Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the\nquestion. Going back to inflation, is the Fed “ behind the curve ” on getting inflation under\ncontrol?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say this . I actually think we are well positioned to deal\nwith, with what ’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come. I do. And I think\nif you look at how we got here, I do think we ’ve, we’ve been adapting to the i ncoming data,\nreally all the way along , and, you know, noticing and calling out that , that the—both the effects\nand the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that. So we ’ve\nbeen calling out the fact that those were be coming longer , and more persistent , and larger. And\nnow we ’re in a position where we ’re ending our taper within the next —well, by March , in two\nmeetings, and we ’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it ’s appropriate.\nAnd we wil l, if that—to the extent that ’s appropriate. At the same time, we ’re going to be seeing\na few more months of data. I don ’t actually think we ’re out of position now. I think this was an\nimportant move for us to make. I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was\na—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher —and that the risk of it\nremaining higher for longer has grown. And I think we ’re reacting to that now . And we ’ll\ncontinue to adapt our policy. S o I wouldn’ t look at it that we ’re “behind the curve.” I would\nlook at it that we ’re actually in position now to take the steps that we ’ll need to take, you know,\nin a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of , of too-high inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let ’s go to Evan at Market News.\nEVAN RYSER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you. I was wondering if we should still be\nseeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate. And , secondly, in the last cycle, t he Fed\n\nstarted shrinking the balance sheet when short -term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent\nrange. Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that\nthis time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Are they separate? So our intere st rate —I mean, they are separate\ntools. So the —you know, the , the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates.\nStopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation. I t just stops adding further\naccommodation. W hereas raising interest rat es starts to remove accommodation from what is a\nhighly accommodative stance. You know, the extent to which they’ ll be separated in time is , is\nsomething we haven’ t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet. We will be discussing\nthat, obviously, in coming meetings. I don’ t think that, that —the last cycle, there was quite a\nlong separation before interest rates. I don’ t think that ’s at all likely in this cycle. We ’re in a\nvery, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy. You\nknow, that —as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent —\n3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the —you know, headline inflation of\n2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7. So thi s is a strong economy, one in which it ’s appropriate for,\nfor interest rate hikes. So they’ re separate, I would say. Your —sorry, your second\nquestion was?\nEVAN RYSER. My second question was about runoff.\nCHAIR POWELL. Runoff.\nEVAN RYSER. In the last cycle.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet\ndiscussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week. We ’ll have another at the next m eeting and another at the\n\nmeeting after that I suspect . These are interesting issues to discuss. [We] didn’t make any\ndecisions today. We look ed back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was\ninteresting and informative. And —but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a\ndifferent situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance\nsheet this time. So [we] haven’ t made any decisions at all about , about when runoff would start,\nbut we ’re—we’ll be continuing to— you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the\nend of the taper. But those are exactly the decisions we’ ll be turning to in coming meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR.\nSCOT T HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I think you said a few minutes ago that the\ninflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we —that you anticipated\nwhen you crafted the framework. And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply -side hiccups. Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken , or is\nthe inflation just a consequence of —that we have to put up with because of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I ’m not expressing any judgment about , about the stimulus in , in\nthat comment. What I ’m saying is , there ’s a— there’s a sense among some that “ you wanted\ninflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it ?,” you know? And the truth is, this is not\nthe inflation that we were —what we were talking about in the —in the framework was inflation\nthat comes from a tight labor market, right? So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period ,\nand we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent. And I —you know, I think, in that\nsetting, our thinking wa s, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather\nthan [acting] preempt ive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent\nunemployment would look like —with high labor force participation, by the way. No one had\nseen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades. And we didn’ t\n\nknow what the inflationary implications were . It turned out there was barely 2 percent\ninflation —and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing. So we\nincorporate d that into our framework.\nThis is something completely different. You know, that ’s a situation where you had a\nvery, very high level of employment and low inflation. This is literally the opposite. Or, you\nknow, it has been the opposite , where we have very high inflation and we ’ve had it since the\nlabor market was in terrible shape. It had nothing —so far, this inflation has really nothing to do\nwith tightness in the labor market. It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong\ndemand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress. I ’m not making any judgments\non Congress, it ’s not my job. But I will just say, we ’re coming out of a, you know, what we\ncertainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic —the first really global modern\npandemic —which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression. And , you\nknow, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy] . And what ’s coming out now is, is, you\nknow, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing. You\nknow, people will judge in 25 years whether we —whether we overdid it or not , but, you know,\nthe reality is, we are where we are. And, you know, we think our policy is , is the right one for\nthe situation that we ’re in.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let ’s go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Wanted to ask about the bond markets . When\nyou see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment\nby which you might be hiking interest rates into? Would you prefer the curve be a little bit\nsteeper? What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL. So I , I think the short -end actions are easy to understand, which is,\nyou know, they’ re basically very [monetary] policy- sensitive rates at the short end , and it makes\nsense that it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy. I think a lot of thing s go into the ,\nyou know, the long rates. And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields\naround the world. Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’ re so much lower. You can get —you\ncan get , you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasur ies by buying USTs rather than bunds\nand you can —you can hedge , hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be\nway ahead. So, in a way, it ’s not surprising that there ’s a lot of demand for , for U.S. sovereigns\nin a world —you know, in a risk -free world where , where there ’s so much —they’ re yielding so\nmuch more than bunds are, than JGBs. So that ’s, that’s a big part of it.\nI also think, you know, there , there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral\nrate is or what the terminal rate is. I don’ t know about that. But—and I would just say that we ,\nyou know, we write down our own estimates of the —of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of\ninterest. Those are highly uncertain. And, you know, we ’ll make policy based on what we ’re\nseeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral —what a model might say the neutral\nrate is. We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were\ntrying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out —you know, I think we learned a\nlot from seeing what happens. We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent. So I ’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is. You know, I see that it ’s low.\nYou know, I mean, we ’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we ’re focused on\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we ’ll go to Greg Robb.\n\nGREG ROBB. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, I was wondering if —I want ed to\ngive you the opportunity to talk about something that I ’ve heard that ’s been discussed —that, you\nknow, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the\ntiming of your renomination by the President. Tha nk you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure, I ’d be happy to talk about that. So, as I mentioned, we got the\nECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the labor market report two days after\nthe meeting . And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI\nreading. It was really the CPI reading , in concert with those two, and I , I just came to the view\nover that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper. And we started working on that . That's\na full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me. So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all . And I just thought this is what we got to do. My\ncolleagues were out talking about the —a faster taper. And that doesn’ t happen by accident.\nThey were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision. So it ’s a\ndecision that effectively was in —more than in train and, you know, to the point where people\nwere talking about it publicly. So that ’s what happened . And it had absolutely nothing to do\nwith it whatsoever. We ’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I\ncertainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people\nthat we serve.\nGREG ROBB. Just a quick follow -up. I guess that some people are saying that it was\nthe, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over —we didn’ t really need all that\nstimulus , and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistak e and it would lead to\nhigher inflation. And perhaps that you didn’ t push back as much as you might have otherwise.\n\nCHAIR POWELL. I didn’ t push back at all. And the reason I didn’ t—and there was\nno—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job. We are\nnot the CBO , and we ’re not elected by anybody. So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front\ndoor, and we don’ t comment —you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it ’s\nreally not our role. And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who’s in the White House, who’ s in Congress. It ’s just —it’s just not our job and it ’s something\nwe avoid pretty, pretty assiduously.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, everyone."
